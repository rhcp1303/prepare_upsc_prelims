**1. With reference to the Charter Act of 1833, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandated the payment of one lakh rupees annually from Indian revenues to fund the establishment of a new college dedicated to the advancement of literature, learning, and science for the benefit of Indian natives.
2.  This Act formally ended the East India Company's monopoly over the lucrative tea trade with China, opening it up to private enterprise and significantly impacting the British economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Charter Act of 1833 did indeed allocate a sum of one lakh rupees annually from Indian revenues for the "revival, promotion, and encouragement of literature, learning, and science among the natives of India." This demonstrated a shift, albeit a limited one, towards acknowledging the importance of education for the Indian population.  While the exact nature of its implementation might be debated, the allocation itself is a historically verifiable fact.  The statement correctly reflects this provision.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Charter Act of 1833 marked a significant turning point by ending the East India Company's monopoly on the tea trade with China. This had major economic ramifications, opening the trade to private companies and individuals.  This move reflected the broader trend of laissez-faire economics gaining prominence in Britain at the time and aimed to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of British trade. The removal of this monopoly directly benefited British businesses and the British economy as a whole.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect provisions within the Charter Act of 1833. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act introduced a system of 'dyarchy' at the provincial level, dividing administrative responsibilities between elected Indian ministers and appointed British officials, with the latter retaining control over key areas like law and order.
2.  This Act established a statutory Public Service Commission, responsible for overseeing the recruitment and promotion of civil servants, ensuring transparency and meritocracy in the selection process, thereby dramatically increasing Indian representation in the civil services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced dyarchy (dual governance) in the provinces. This system divided subjects into "reserved" (controlled by British officials) and "transferred" (handled by Indian ministers) categories. While it represented a step towards self-governance, the crucial "reserved" subjects, including law and order and finance, remained firmly under British control. This carefully controlled power-sharing arrangement is a key feature of the 1919 Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the 1919 Act did establish a statutory Public Service Commission, its impact on increasing Indian representation in the civil services was far more gradual and less dramatic than the statement suggests. The Commission aimed to improve the recruitment process, but the dominance of British officials in the higher echelons of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) continued for many years after the Act's implementation.  The statement overstates the immediate and significant impact of the Commission on Indian representation.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Permanent Settlement of Lord Cornwallis:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement granted proprietary rights to the Zamindars, making them the sole intermediaries between the British government and the cultivators, thereby significantly increasing the power and influence of the Zamindari class.
2.  This system, while intended to ensure a stable and predictable revenue stream for the British, inadvertently led to the widespread subinfeudation of land, resulting in increased exploitation of the peasantry through multiple layers of rent extraction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented by Lord Cornwallis, fundamentally altered the land revenue system in certain parts of British India.  A key element of this system was the granting of proprietary rights to the Zamindars, establishing them as the primary intermediaries between the British government and the peasant cultivators. This dramatically increased the Zamindars' power and economic influence, transforming their role from mere tax collectors to landowners with considerable authority over the land and its inhabitants.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Permanent Settlement, while aiming for revenue stability, had unintended consequences.  The fixed revenue demand placed on Zamindars often exceeded their capacity to collect, leading them to sublet their lands to Patnidars and other intermediaries. This created a multi-tiered system of rent extraction, with the burden falling disproportionately on the peasantry. This complex system of subinfeudation, characterized by multiple layers of rent collection, exacerbated the exploitation of the cultivators and contributed to their impoverishment.


**4. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1861, consider the following statements:**

1. This Act introduced a system of indirect elections to the legislative councils at both the central and provincial levels, marking a significant step towards greater Indian participation in the legislative process.
2.  While increasing the number of non-official members in the legislative councils, the Act still granted the Governor-General extensive powers, including the authority to veto any legislation passed by the councils.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 did not introduce a system of indirect elections.  While it increased the number of non-official members in the legislative councils (both central and provincial), these members were nominated, not elected.  The Act represented a modest step towards greater Indian representation, but it fell short of establishing any form of elected representation. The statement misrepresents the method of selecting council members.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Councils Act of 1861, while expanding the legislative councils to include non-official members, maintained the Governor-General's considerable authority.  The Governor-General retained the power to veto any legislation passed by the councils, effectively limiting the councils' legislative power and highlighting the continued dominance of the British executive.  The statement accurately reflects the imbalance of power between the executive and the legislature.


**5. With reference to the impact of British revenue policies on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ryotwari system, implemented in several parts of British India, aimed to collect land revenue directly from individual cultivators, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring a more equitable distribution of land ownership.
2.  The Permanent Settlement, while granting proprietary rights to Zamindars, inadvertently resulted in the decline of agricultural productivity due to the Zamindars’ focus on rent extraction rather than agricultural improvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ryotwari system, while aiming to collect revenue directly from cultivators, did not lead to a more equitable distribution of land ownership.  Although it eliminated the Zamindar as an intermediary, it often resulted in high tax burdens on individual cultivators, leading to indebtedness and dispossession. The system's focus was on maximizing revenue for the British, not on equitable land distribution.  The statement misrepresents the system's outcome.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Permanent Settlement, while intended to create a stable revenue stream, had detrimental effects on agricultural productivity.  Zamindars, granted proprietary rights, often prioritized rent collection over agricultural improvements.  This led to neglect of irrigation, land reclamation, and other practices that would have enhanced agricultural output. The system fostered a system where maximizing rent, not agricultural production, was the primary goal.  The statement accurately describes a major consequence of the Permanent Settlement.

**1. With reference to the Vernacular Press Act (VPA) of 1878, consider the following statements:**

1. The VPA primarily targeted newspapers and journals published in Indian vernacular languages, aiming to curb criticism of British policies.
2.  The Act empowered the government to seize printing presses and impose censorship without trial, significantly restricting freedom of the press.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, enacted during Lord Lytton's viceroyalty, was a direct response to the growing nationalist sentiment expressed through vernacular language newspapers and journals.  Statement 1 accurately reflects the Act's primary target. The British government perceived these publications as a threat to their authority, as they often carried critical commentary on British policies and actions. The Act aimed to control the narrative and suppress dissenting voices.

Statement 2 is also correct. The VPA granted the government extensive powers to control the press. It allowed for the pre-emptive seizure of printing presses, the imposition of heavy fines and bonds on publishers, and the censorship of articles deemed objectionable without the need for a formal trial. This resulted in a significant curtailment of freedom of the press and severely hampered the ability of Indian journalists to report and comment freely on political matters.  The lack of due process and the arbitrary nature of the powers granted under the VPA made it a highly controversial piece of legislation, further fueling resentment against the British Raj.  The other options are incorrect because both statements accurately describe key aspects of the VPA's impact.


**2. With reference to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Vidyasagar's efforts played a crucial role in the legalisation of widow remarriage in Bengal, significantly impacting social reform.
2.  He established the Sanskrit College with the primary aim of promoting Western thought and modernizing traditional education.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a pivotal figure in the 19th-century Bengal Renaissance.  Statement 1 correctly highlights his significant role in the social reform movement. His tireless advocacy and persuasive arguments played a crucial role in the passage of legislation legalizing widow remarriage in Bengal. This was a landmark achievement that challenged deeply ingrained social customs and improved the lives of many widows.  His efforts went beyond mere advocacy; he actively worked to change societal attitudes and perceptions regarding widows.

Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While Vidyasagar was instrumental in reforming the Sanskrit College, making it more accessible to non-Brahmins, its primary aim was not the promotion of Western thought. His reforms focused on making traditional education more inclusive and relevant to contemporary needs. The introduction of Western thought was a secondary aspect of his reforms,  not the core objective.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent Vidyasagar's primary goals in reforming the Sanskrit College.


**3. With reference to Raja Ram Mohan Roy's multifaceted contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Ram Mohan Roy's advocacy for the abolition of Sati was primarily driven by his belief in the principles of rationalism and the inherent dignity of women.
2. He founded the Brahmo Samaj with the specific goal of establishing a theistic religion that synthesized elements of Hinduism and Christianity.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a key figure in the socio-religious reform movement of 19th-century India. Statement 1 accurately describes a major aspect of his work. His campaign against Sati was not merely a social reform initiative; it was deeply rooted in his rationalist philosophy and his unwavering belief in the equality and dignity of women. He challenged the deeply entrenched orthodox practices, using logic and reason to expose their inhumanity and injustice. His efforts were instrumental in the abolition of Sati.


Statement 2 is partially correct but oversimplifies Roy's intentions. While he did found the Brahmo Samaj and advocated for a monotheistic faith, the goal wasn't primarily to synthesize Hinduism and Christianity. His aim was to purify Hinduism from what he perceived as superstitious and idolatrous practices and to emphasize the ethical and monotheistic aspects of the religion.  While he drew inspiration from various religious traditions, including Christianity, the Brahmo Samaj aimed to create a unique theistic faith based on reason and ethical principles.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is entirely correct, as it accurately reflects his rationale behind his campaign against Sati.


**4. With reference to the impact of the East India Company's rule on India's administrative structure, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the civil service system by the East India Company led to a gradual Indianisation of administrative positions, significantly empowering Indians.
2. The Company's revenue policies, particularly the Permanent Settlement, resulted in widespread economic prosperity for the Indian peasantry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The East India Company's rule had a profound and multifaceted impact on India's administrative structure. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the East India Company did establish a civil service system, the process of Indianization was slow, limited, and largely aimed at serving British interests.  Key positions remained firmly in European hands for a considerable period.  Though Indians were eventually admitted into the ICS, it was a long and arduous process, with significant hurdles and discriminatory practices in place. The system did not result in significant empowerment for Indians in the early stages.


Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Company's revenue policies, especially the Permanent Settlement, did not lead to economic prosperity for the Indian peasantry.  While intended to streamline revenue collection, it often led to increased exploitation and impoverishment of the peasantry. The high revenue demands placed on the zamindars, coupled with the lack of protection for the ryots, resulted in widespread indebtedness and displacement.  The system also led to the growth of absentee landlordism and the concentration of land ownership in fewer hands. Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the complex and often negative consequences of the East India Company's administrative and revenue policies.



**5. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a bicameral federal legislature, consisting of the Council of States (Upper House) and the Federal Legislative Assembly (Lower House), with significant representation for the princely states.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, abolishing dyarchy and granting provinces significant self-governing powers, while retaining certain safeguards for British interests.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, was a landmark piece of legislation that significantly reshaped the Indian political landscape. Statement 1 accurately reflects a key feature of the Act. It established a bicameral federal legislature, comprising the Council of States (Upper House) and the Federal Legislative Assembly (Lower House). A notable aspect was the substantial representation allocated to the princely states in both houses, reflecting the British strategy of incorporating them into the proposed federal structure.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act introduced a crucial element of provincial autonomy. It abolished the system of dyarchy, which had divided powers between elected ministers and the Governor, and granted provinces significant self-governing powers.  However, the Act also incorporated certain safeguards to protect British interests.  The Governor retained considerable powers, including the power to veto legislation and to intervene in provincial affairs under certain circumstances.   The other options are incorrect as both statements correctly describe key features of the 1935 Act.  The Act's attempt to create a federation with the princely states and its introduction of provincial autonomy were significant constitutional developments, although the Act's limitations and the ultimate failure of the federation are also important considerations.


**6. With reference to Lord Curzon's tenure as Viceroy, consider the following statements:**

1. Curzon's administration was characterized by a strong emphasis on centralizing authority and strengthening the power of the British government in India.
2. He implemented significant administrative reforms that aimed to modernize Indian agriculture, including the establishment of the Pusa Agricultural Research Institute.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lord Curzon's viceroyalty (1899-1905) was a period of significant administrative activity in British India. Statement 1 accurately reflects his approach to governance. Curzon was a staunch imperialist who believed in a strong, centralized administration under direct British control. He implemented several measures aimed at enhancing the power and authority of the central government, often at the expense of provincial autonomy. His emphasis on efficiency and order often came at the cost of accommodating Indian aspirations for greater self-governance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Curzon's administration saw various initiatives to modernize and improve Indian agriculture.  A key example is the establishment of the Pusa Agricultural Research Institute, which played a significant role in agricultural research and development in India.  His interest in modernizing the Indian economy also led to other infrastructure projects.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of Curzon's administrative policies and their impact on India.


**7.  With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1892, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act significantly expanded the membership of both the Imperial Legislative Council and provincial legislative councils, increasing the representation of non-official members.
2.  The Act introduced direct elections to the legislative councils, marking a significant step towards greater Indian participation in governance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1892 was a response to growing calls for greater Indian participation in governance. Statement 1 accurately reflects one of its key provisions. The Act did indeed expand the membership of both the Imperial Legislative Council and the provincial legislative councils.  A notable feature was the increase in the number of non-official members, although they still remained a minority compared to the official members. This expansion, however, did not represent a substantial transfer of power.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act did not introduce direct elections to the legislative councils.  While it did allow for some indirect election of non-official members through nominations from certain bodies like universities and local boards, it did not establish a system of direct elections based on universal suffrage.  The process remained significantly controlled by the British government.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, highlighting the limited nature of the reforms introduced by the Act.



**8. With reference to the role of the East India Company in shaping India's judicial system, consider the following statements:**

1. The establishment of the Supreme Court at Calcutta under the Regulating Act of 1773 marked a significant step towards establishing a unified and centralized judicial system across British India.
2. The Company's efforts to codify Indian laws, culminating in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), contributed significantly to the development of a modern legal framework.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The East India Company's rule significantly impacted the development of India's judicial system. Statement 1 is partially correct but overstates the extent of unification and centralization.  The establishment of the Supreme Court at Calcutta was a significant step, but it did not immediately lead to a unified judicial system across British India.  The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court often clashed with that of other existing courts, leading to jurisdictional disputes and complexities.  The process of creating a unified judicial system was gradual and evolved over time.


Statement 2 is largely correct. The Company's efforts to codify Indian laws, under the impetus of the Charter Act of 1833 and subsequent legislative reforms, were crucial in creating a modern legal framework. The establishment of the Law Commission under Macaulay and the subsequent codification of laws, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), represented a significant step towards establishing a modern and uniform legal system.  These codes, based on English common law but adapted to the Indian context, formed the basis of Indian criminal law for many years.  Therefore, statement 2 is more accurate than statement 1.


**9. With reference to the impact of the 1857 Revolt on British policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The revolt led to the immediate and complete dismantling of the East India Company's rule, with the British Crown assuming direct control over India.
2. The revolt prompted the British to adopt a more conciliatory approach towards Indian aspirations for greater self-governance and participation in administration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 1857 Revolt had a profound and lasting impact on British policies in India. Statement 1 is correct.  The revolt directly resulted in the dissolution of the East India Company's rule and the transfer of power to the British Crown. This marked a significant shift in the governance of India, establishing direct Crown rule and enhancing the central control exercised from London.  The Government of India Act 1858 formalized this transition.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The revolt did not immediately lead to a more conciliatory approach toward Indian aspirations for self-governance. While there were some changes in administrative policies aimed at reducing the alienation of the Indian masses, such as increasing Indian representation in certain areas, these were largely tactical measures aimed at consolidating British control rather than genuine transfers of power.  The British response was initially characterized by a period of repression followed by a gradual and calculated process of reforms, which were often limited in scope and designed to serve British interests. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects an immediate and direct consequence of the 1857 Revolt.


**10. With reference to the evolution of local self-government in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Ripon's resolution of 1882 emphasized the importance of increasing official control over local bodies to ensure efficiency and prevent corruption.
2. The Government of India Act, 1919 introduced dyarchy in the provinces, making local self-government a transferred subject under the control of elected ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The evolution of local self-government in British India was a complex and gradual process. Statement 1 is incorrect. Lord Ripon's resolution of 1882, often considered a landmark in the development of local self-government, actually advocated for *decreasing* official control over local bodies and increasing the participation of non-officials.  His aim was to promote local autonomy and to use local bodies as instruments of political education.  The emphasis was on decentralization and empowering local communities.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Government of India Act, 1919, which introduced dyarchy in the provinces, did indeed make local self-government a 'transferred' subject. This meant that the administration of local bodies came under the control of elected ministers, marking a significant step towards greater Indian participation in governance at the local level.  However, the limitations of dyarchy, particularly the retention of key powers by the Governor, should also be considered.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the development of local self-government during this period.

**1. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1861, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act significantly expanded the powers of the existing provincial legislative councils, granting them near-equal legislative authority to the Governor-General's Council.
2.  A key provision of the Act was the establishment of a separate, independent judiciary branch, completely separate from the executive branch, to ensure fairness and impartiality in legal proceedings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 did create legislative councils in Bombay and Madras, restoring powers previously curtailed, and also established similar councils in other provinces. However, these provincial councils were not granted near-equal legislative authority to the Governor-General's Council. The Governor-General's Council retained significant power and the final say over legislation.  The Act primarily aimed to expand legislative opportunities, but power remained firmly centralized.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act did not establish a separate, independent judiciary completely detached from the executive.  While the Act contributed to the evolution of the Indian legal system, the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary was not a central feature or a fully realized outcome of the 1861 Act. The judiciary remained intertwined with the executive structure, a feature that would continue to be debated and refined in later acts.  The focus of the 1861 Act was primarily on legislative reform, not judicial restructuring.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Indian Councils Act of 1892, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act led to the complete enfranchisement of the Indian population, granting universal adult suffrage and significantly increasing Indian participation in the governance of the country.
2.  The Act introduced a system of indirect elections for some members of the legislative councils, marking a significant step towards representative government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did not lead to universal adult suffrage.  The franchise remained highly restricted, based on property, tax, or educational qualifications, excluding the vast majority of the Indian population from direct participation in elections. While the Act increased the number of non-official members in legislative councils, it fell far short of granting complete enfranchisement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act introduced an element of indirect election for some non-official members of legislative councils.  This involved various bodies like universities, district boards, and chambers of commerce recommending candidates, a step towards a more representative system, albeit a limited one.  Direct elections were still largely absent, but the inclusion of indirect election represented a notable shift from pure nomination.  This system of indirect election, however, still largely excluded the common people from political participation.



**3. With reference to the Zamindari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Zamindari system, established by Lord Cornwallis, ensured equitable land distribution and protected the rights of peasant cultivators against exploitation by landlords.
2.  The Faraizi movement, a peasant uprising, directly challenged the oppressive aspects of the Zamindari system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Zamindari system, while aiming for efficient revenue collection, did not ensure equitable land distribution.  It concentrated land ownership in the hands of Zamindars, who often exploited peasant cultivators through high rents and other oppressive practices. The system created a hierarchical structure that led to widespread inequality and injustice in the rural areas.  The system's intention was not to protect peasant rights but to consolidate revenue collection for the British.

Statement 2 is correct. The Faraizi movement, a significant peasant uprising in Bengal, directly challenged the exploitative nature of the Zamindari system.  The movement, led by Haji Shariatullah and his followers, fought against the injustices inflicted upon peasants by Zamindars and the British revenue system. The movement highlighted the inherent flaws and the social consequences of the Zamindari system.


**4.  With reference to the evolution of the Viceroy's authority, consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India Act, 1858, explicitly reduced the Viceroy's power, shifting significant authority to the newly created Secretary of State for India in London.
2. The "portfolio" system, introduced during the Viceroyalty of Lord Curzon, significantly strengthened the Viceroy's control over the executive council by replacing the previous system of collective decision-making.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1858, while transferring sovereignty from the East India Company to the British Crown, did not explicitly reduce the Viceroy's power.  Although the Secretary of State for India gained significant influence, the Viceroy remained the supreme executive authority in India. The Act aimed at enhancing accountability but did not diminish the Viceroy's power.  The Secretary of State's increased influence, however, laid the groundwork for a gradual shift in power.

Statement 2 is correct.  The introduction of the portfolio system did strengthen the Viceroy's authority. By assigning specific departments to individual members of the executive council, the system moved away from a collective decision-making model. This allowed the Viceroy to exercise more direct control over the administration and policy implementation.  Each council member became responsible for their portfolio, making the Viceroy the ultimate arbiter of decisions.



**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Civil Service (ICS):**

1. The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 introduced a system of open competitive examinations held simultaneously in India and Britain, ensuring equal opportunities for both Indian and British candidates.
2. The Lee Commission, appointed in 1924, recommended a gradual increase in the number of Indians in the ICS, aiming for a 50:50 parity between Indian and British officers within a specified timeframe.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 did not introduce simultaneous examinations in India and Britain. Examinations were held only in Britain, creating a significant barrier for Indian candidates due to the language barrier and the cost of travelling to Britain.  The Act represented a step towards formalizing recruitment but did not address the issue of equal opportunity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lee Commission did recommend a gradual increase in Indian representation within the ICS, aiming for 50:50 parity between Indian and British officers. While the goal was not immediately achieved, the recommendation marked a significant step towards the Indianization of the civil service.  The commission's recommendations, however, were not implemented immediately, and the process of Indianization continued gradually over several decades.


**6. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced dyarchy in the provinces, dividing subjects into "reserved" and "transferred" categories, with the latter being administered by Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures.
2. The Act established a completely independent and sovereign Indian legislature with full control over the budget and executive actions of the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced dyarchy in the provinces.  This system divided administrative subjects into "reserved" (under the Governor's control) and "transferred" (under Indian ministers responsible to provincial legislatures) categories. This was a significant step towards limited self-government, although the Governor retained considerable power, especially over crucial areas like finance and law and order.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act did not establish a completely independent and sovereign Indian legislature. While the Act expanded the legislative councils and increased Indian representation, the Indian legislature lacked full control over the budget and executive actions. The Governor-General retained significant powers, including the ability to veto legislation and control crucial aspects of governance, ensuring that real power remained with the British administration.  The 1919 Act was a step towards self-governance but did not lead to complete legislative independence.


**7. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully independent and sovereign Indian federation with complete control over its internal affairs, free from any external interference.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, abolishing dyarchy and granting responsible government in the provinces, subject to certain safeguards.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did not establish a fully independent and sovereign Indian federation. The proposed federation was to include both British India and the Princely States, but the latter's participation was voluntary and conditional, and the ultimate authority still rested with the British Crown.  The Act's aim was to move towards greater Indian self-governance but not full independence.  The federation, moreover, never actually materialized due to opposition from various Indian groups.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act did introduce provincial autonomy, abolishing dyarchy and establishing responsible government in the provinces. While certain safeguards remained to protect British interests, the provinces gained significant self-governing powers in many areas of administration.  This was a major constitutional advance towards greater Indian control over their internal affairs, although the central government remained largely under British control.


**8.  With reference to the Pitt's India Act of 1784, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established the Board of Control, effectively transferring the supreme authority over the East India Company from the Court of Directors to the British Parliament.
2.  The Act ended the dual system of government in Bengal, bringing the entire administration under the direct control of the Governor-General.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Pitt's India Act of 1784 established the Board of Control, a body responsible to the British Parliament. This significantly increased parliamentary oversight and control over the East India Company's affairs, including its governance in India. While the Court of Directors still retained some functions, the Board of Control had the ultimate say in major policy decisions, effectively shifting the supreme authority.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act also ended the dual system of government in Bengal.  The dual system, established earlier, had seen a division of power between the Company and the Nawab of Bengal.  Pitt's Act consolidated power under the Governor-General, who now had supreme authority within Bengal. This was a crucial step in centralizing British control over the region.  The Act aimed at improving efficiency and accountability in administration.

**1. With reference to the Permanent Settlement of 1793, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement granted hereditary proprietary rights to Zamindars, essentially making them landowners.
2.  The Ryotwari system, implemented concurrently in certain regions, directly collected revenue from individual cultivators, bypassing Zamindars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement of 1793, implemented primarily in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of Orissa, fundamentally altered the existing agrarian structure. Statement 1 accurately reflects a core feature:  Zamindars were granted proprietary rights over their lands, a significant departure from previous systems. This created a class of landowners with inheritable rights, transforming their role from mere tax collectors to landlords.  The British hoped this would incentivize agricultural improvements and stabilize revenue collection.

Statement 2 is also correct because the Ryotwari system, a contrasting approach, existed concurrently in other regions, particularly in parts of Madras and Bombay Presidencies.  Unlike the Permanent Settlement, which focused on collecting revenue through Zamindars, the Ryotwari system established a direct relationship between the British government and individual cultivators (ryots).  The revenue was assessed directly from these cultivators, bypassing the intermediary role of Zamindars.  Therefore, both systems coexisted during British rule, representing different land revenue administration models.  The existence of both systems highlights the British's pragmatic and regionally varied approach to revenue collection.


**2. With reference to the impact of British land revenue policies on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of North India, aimed to collect revenue from village communities collectively, preserving traditional village structures.
2.  The high revenue demands under all three major land revenue systems (Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari) led to widespread peasant indebtedness and dispossession.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct in its description of the Mahalwari system's initial intention.  This system, implemented in parts of North India, attempted to collect land revenue from village communities as a whole (mahal), rather than individual cultivators or a single Zamindar.  The aim was to integrate existing village structures into the revenue collection process. However, in practice, this ideal was often compromised.  The system's implementation faced significant challenges, and the collective responsibility often devolved into individual burdens, failing to fully protect traditional village structures.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the objectives of the Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari systems differed, a common outcome was the imposition of high revenue demands. These demands, often exceeding the capacity of cultivators to pay, led to widespread peasant indebtedness.  Farmers were forced to borrow money from moneylenders, often at exorbitant rates, leading to loss of land and further impoverishment. This contributed significantly to the economic vulnerability of the peasantry and the disruption of traditional agrarian society. The high revenue demands, regardless of the specific system, formed a significant factor in the economic exploitation of the rural population.


**3. With reference to British administrative policies after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British administration, after the 1857 Revolt, actively promoted social reforms to improve the lives of Indians and foster goodwill.
2.  The policy of "divide and rule" involved exploiting existing social and religious divisions in India to maintain British control and prevent unified opposition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The British response to the 1857 Revolt marked a significant shift in their approach to India.  Rather than pursuing broad social reforms to win over the Indian population, they adopted a more cautious and, in many ways, reactionary stance.  Fearful of further uprisings, the British prioritized maintaining control and suppressing dissent.  Their support for social reforms diminished as they perceived these reforms as potentially destabilizing factors.  Instead, they increasingly aligned themselves with conservative elements within Indian society.

Statement 2 accurately describes a central aspect of British policy after 1857.  The "divide and rule" strategy became a cornerstone of their approach to governance.  They actively fostered divisions between different religious groups, castes, and regions to prevent the emergence of a unified national movement that could challenge their authority.  This strategy involved playing different groups against each other, preventing the formation of a cohesive national identity focused on resisting British rule. This policy significantly shaped the political landscape of India during the colonial period and had long-lasting consequences.


**4. With reference to British India's labour conditions in the 19th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The first Indian Factory Act of 1881 primarily focused on regulating working hours for adult male workers, addressing concerns about worker exhaustion.
2.  The British government actively supported the exploitation of labour in tea plantations in Assam, passing legislation that effectively bound laborers to their work.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initial focus of the 1881 Factory Act was not on adult male workers. It primarily addressed the issue of child labor, setting minimum age limits and regulating working hours for children.  While concerns about adult worker exhaustion existed, the 1881 Act primarily prioritized the protection of children from exploitation in factories. Later legislation would address adult worker conditions more comprehensively.

Statement 2 is correct. The British government's approach to labour in the tea plantations of Assam was characterized by a distinct lack of concern for worker welfare.  They actively facilitated the exploitation of laborers, often recruited through coercive means. Legislation passed during the period (e.g., acts of 1863, 1865, 1870, 1873, and 1882) effectively criminalized breaches of contract by laborers, binding them to their work and limiting their ability to seek better conditions. This approach enabled the plantation owners to maintain a system of virtual servitude.  The government's actions highlight the prioritization of economic interests over worker rights.


**5. With reference to the British policy towards the Indian press, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 imposed strict censorship on newspapers published in English, aiming to curb nationalist sentiments expressed in the dominant language of the educated elite.
2.  Lord Lytton's administration is associated with the introduction of repressive press laws, reflecting a growing concern about the influence of the Indian press on public opinion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 specifically targeted newspapers published in Indian vernacular languages, not English. The British aimed to control the dissemination of nationalist ideas among the wider population through these publications, which were more accessible to a larger segment of the population than English newspapers.  The act's focus on vernacular press reflects the British understanding of the potential for these publications to incite unrest.

Statement 2 is correct. Lord Lytton's administration is indeed strongly associated with the introduction of repressive press laws, including the Vernacular Press Act of 1878. This reflects a growing unease within the British administration regarding the increasing power of the Indian press to shape public opinion and mobilize nationalist sentiment.  The legislation marked a significant curtailment of press freedom in India, highlighting the British government's efforts to suppress dissent. The actions under Lytton's administration reveal the British government's increasingly authoritarian approach to managing the nationalist movement.

**1. With reference to Dadabhai Naoroji's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji served as the President of the Indian National Congress on three separate occasions.
2.  He significantly influenced the Swadeshi movement through his advocacy for economic self-reliance and criticism of British economic policies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji's legacy in Indian nationalism is multifaceted.  Statement 1 is accurate; he held the presidency of the Indian National Congress thrice, showcasing his significant leadership role during the formative years of the Congress.  His presidency cemented his position as a prominent figure in the moderate phase of the Indian National Congress. This demonstrates his influence on the early development of the organization and his capacity for leadership within the movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. While not solely responsible for the Swadeshi movement, Naoroji's influence is undeniable. His articulation of the "Drain Theory," which detailed the systematic outflow of India's wealth to Britain, provided a powerful economic critique of British rule. This critique fueled the nationalist sentiment advocating for Swadeshi, or self-rule and the promotion of Indian-made goods. His writings and speeches powerfully highlighted the economic exploitation inherent in British policies, galvanizing support for the Swadeshi movement's aims of economic self-sufficiency and challenging the economic foundations of colonial rule.  His work directly contributed to the intellectual framework within which the Swadeshi movement operated. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Dadabhai Naoroji's significant contributions to Indian nationalism.


**2. With reference to Sir Syed Ahmad Khan's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sir Syed Ahmad Khan primarily wrote in Persian, aiming to bridge the gap between Muslim intellectuals and traditional scholarship.
2.  He is widely credited with establishing the Aligarh Muslim University, a pivotal institution in modernizing Muslim education in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Sir Syed Ahmad Khan's contributions to Indian society and education were significant, but Statement 1 presents an inaccurate portrayal of his literary output. While he was proficient in Persian and utilized it in some of his works, his writings were not primarily in Persian.  A significant portion of his work was dedicated to promoting Urdu and English, recognizing their importance in modern education and communication. He actively promoted the use of English as a tool for accessing Western knowledge and saw it as crucial for the advancement of Indian Muslims. His focus on Urdu was equally significant, aiming to modernize the language and make it more accessible for wider use. Therefore, the assertion that Persian was his primary language of writing is incorrect.

Statement 2 is accurate. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan is rightfully recognized as the founder of the Aligarh Movement, which led to the establishment of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College (later Aligarh Muslim University). This institution played a critical role in promoting modern education among Indian Muslims, aiming to equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate effectively in the changing socio-political landscape of India. His vision for the college, and its subsequent development into a university, demonstrates his commitment to education reform and his profound impact on Muslim society.


**3. With reference to the Charter Act of 1813, consider the following statements:**

1. The Charter Act of 1813 completely abolished the East India Company's monopoly over trade with India, opening it up to all British subjects.
2.  A significant allocation of funds was earmarked for the promotion of education in India under this Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Charter Act of 1813 marked a turning point in the British East India Company's relationship with the British government and its control over India. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act did significantly curtail the Company's trade monopoly, it did not abolish it entirely. The Company retained its monopoly over the lucrative tea trade with China,  This demonstrates that while the Act aimed to liberalize trade, it did not completely dismantle the Company's established trade privileges. The partial opening of trade to other British subjects still left the Company with significant economic power.

Statement 2 is correct. For the first time, the Act explicitly allocated funds for the promotion of education and the spread of Christianity in India.  A sum of one lakh rupees was annually allocated for this purpose. This reflects a shift in British policy, acknowledging the need for educational development in India, albeit still intertwined with missionary goals. This allocation, although relatively small compared to other aspects of the Company's expenditure, represented a concrete step towards formalizing British involvement in Indian education.


**4. With reference to the impact of British land revenue systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, implemented primarily in the Madras Presidency, resulted in significantly higher revenue for the British compared to other systems due to its direct collection from cultivators.
2. The Permanent Settlement, while aiming to provide stability, led to the growth of absentee landlordism and the exploitation of ryots.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The British land revenue systems in India had profound and lasting consequences for the agrarian structure and the Indian peasantry. Statement 1 is correct. The Ryotwari system, characterized by direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, was indeed designed to maximize revenue collection for the British government. By eliminating intermediaries like zamindars, the British hoped to capture a larger share of the agricultural surplus.  While the actual revenue generated varied depending on factors like crop yields and assessment accuracy, the system's intention was indeed to improve revenue collection.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Bengal and other regions, aimed to create a stable revenue system by granting land ownership rights to zamindars. However, this system inadvertently led to the rise of absentee landlordism. Zamindars, focused on maximizing their own profits, often neglected the welfare of the ryots (cultivators) and engaged in exploitative practices.  The system's rigidity and high revenue demands also contributed to the impoverishment of many ryots and their increasing dependence on moneylenders.  Thus, both statements accurately capture key features of the impact of British land revenue policies.


**5. With reference to Jawaharlal Nehru's political career, consider the following statements:**

1. Jawaharlal Nehru served as the President of the Indian National Congress during the crucial Lahore session in 1929, where the declaration of Purna Swaraj was adopted.
2. He vehemently opposed the partition of India, advocating for a unified and independent nation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru's role in India's freedom struggle and its subsequent nation-building was pivotal. Statement 1 is correct.  The Lahore session of the Indian National Congress in 1929, presided over by Jawaharlal Nehru, is indeed remembered for the adoption of the declaration of Purna Swaraj (complete independence).  This marked a significant shift in the Congress's stance, demanding full independence from British rule.  His leadership during this session highlights his growing influence within the Congress and his commitment to complete independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nehru expressed concerns about the potential consequences of partition and worked towards finding alternative solutions, he ultimately accepted the partition of India as a fait accompli.  This acceptance was a complex decision shaped by the escalating communal violence and the pragmatic need to establish independent states. His initial preference was for a unified India, but the reality of the situation forced him to accept the partition plan, even though this was a deeply painful and difficult decision for him.  Therefore, the assertion that he vehemently opposed partition throughout is an oversimplification of his complex position.

**1. With reference to the Hunter Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hunter Commission recommended the restructuring of secondary education, emphasizing the use of vernacular languages.
2.  The Hunter Commission's recommendations significantly altered the existing system of education in India by introducing universal adult franchise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Hunter Commission, appointed in 1882 to investigate the causes of the Ilbert Bill controversy,  indirectly impacted India's education system. While its primary focus wasn't education reform, its report touched upon the need for improvements in the existing system. The commission acknowledged shortcomings in secondary education and advocated for restructuring,  promoting the use of vernacular languages alongside English. This was seen as a step towards making education more accessible and relevant to the Indian population.  However, the Hunter Commission did not deal with the introduction of universal adult franchise.  That was a much later development, associated with the Government of India Act of 1935 and the broader movement towards self-governance.  The introduction of universal adult franchise was a major constitutional change, far removed from the scope and intent of the Hunter Commission's investigation. Therefore, statement 1 is correct, while statement 2 is incorrect.  Option (a) is the only accurate representation of the facts.


**2. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahatma Gandhi's first major Satyagraha campaign in India was the Ahmedabad Mill Strike, where he secured a significant wage increase for textile workers.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi's advocacy for Hindu-Muslim unity was consistently successful throughout his career, preventing any instances of communal violence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Gandhi's first significant Satyagraha campaign in India was the Champaran Satyagraha (1917), focusing on the plight of indigo farmers in Bihar.  The Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918) was a subsequent campaign, demonstrating Gandhi's commitment to labor rights. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Gandhi dedicated considerable effort to fostering Hindu-Muslim unity, it remained an elusive goal.  Despite his best efforts, communal tensions and violence persisted throughout his life and tragically culminated in the Partition of India.  Gandhi's attempts at unity, although significant and well-intentioned, were not consistently successful in preventing communal conflict.  Thus, both statements are inaccurate. Option (d) is the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the newspapers and magazines Mahatma Gandhi was associated with, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahatma Gandhi was the editor of the *Young India* and *Navjeevan*, publications known for their advocacy of non-violent resistance.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi's association with *Indian Opinion* ended before his return to India in 1915, marking a shift in his focus to Indian politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi was indeed closely associated with *Young India* and *Navjeevan*, using these publications to disseminate his philosophy of Satyagraha and to mobilize public opinion.  He played a significant editorial role in both.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Gandhi's association with *Indian Opinion* continued even after his return to India in 1915.  Although his primary focus shifted to the Indian context, he maintained ties with this South African publication for some time, reflecting the enduring impact of his experiences there.  The shift in his focus was gradual, not an abrupt ending of his involvement with *Indian Opinion*.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the facts, making option (a) the correct answer.



**4. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance powers to the provinces.
2. The Act established a bicameral legislature at the center, consisting of a Council of States and a House of the People with equal powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 is a landmark piece of legislation in Indian history. A key feature of the Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy, transferring considerable administrative and legislative power to the provinces. This marked a significant step towards self-governance, although the central government retained considerable control over key areas like defence and foreign affairs.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act did establish a bicameral legislature at the center, comprising the Council of States (upper house) and the Federal Assembly (lower house). However, these houses did not possess equal powers.  The Federal Assembly had more legislative powers than the Council of States. This is a crucial distinction often overlooked. The Council of States had fewer powers and served primarily as a revising chamber. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making option (a) the correct choice.


**5. With reference to the Rowlatt Act, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council despite strong opposition from Indian members.
2. The Rowlatt Act empowered the government to imprison individuals without trial for up to two years based on mere suspicion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rowlatt Act of 1919 was a controversial piece of legislation that significantly curtailed civil liberties in India. The Act was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council despite significant opposition from Indian members who vehemently protested against its provisions.  This highlights the limited power and influence of Indian representatives within the colonial legislative framework. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act granted the government extraordinary powers, allowing for the detention of individuals without trial for up to two years based on mere suspicion. This was seen as a draconian measure, violating fundamental rights and fueling widespread resentment among the Indian population. The Act's provisions contributed significantly to the growing unrest and ultimately played a role in escalating the Indian independence movement. Therefore, both statements are accurate, making option (c) the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of the British land revenue systems in India:**

1. The Permanent Settlement led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few, exacerbating social inequalities and creating a class of landless laborers.
2. The Ryotwari system, while aiming for direct revenue collection from cultivators, often resulted in overassessment and widespread indebtedness among the peasantry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The British land revenue systems in India had profound and lasting consequences on the agrarian structure and social fabric of the country. The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Bengal and other areas, granted proprietary rights to Zamindars, creating a powerful landowning class.  This led to the concentration of land ownership, dispossession of many cultivators, and the emergence of a large landless labor force. This significantly aggravated existing social inequalities. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The Ryotwari system, implemented in other regions, aimed to collect revenue directly from individual cultivators (ryots). However, due to inaccurate assessments and inflexible revenue demands, it often resulted in over-taxation and heavy indebtedness among the peasantry, pushing many into poverty and dependence on moneylenders. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct. Both statements accurately capture significant aspects of the long-term consequences of the British land revenue policies, making option (c) the most appropriate answer.


**7. With reference to the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Salt Satyagraha, a key event of the movement, witnessed widespread participation from women, students, and certain sections of the Muslim community.
2. The Civil Disobedience Movement resulted in the immediate establishment of complete independence for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34) was a pivotal moment in India's struggle for independence. The Salt Satyagraha, launched with the Dandi March, was a powerful symbol of defiance against British rule.  It mobilized broad sections of the Indian population, including women who played a significant role in picketing and protests, students who actively boycotted British institutions, and some segments of the Muslim community, although participation varied across regions.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Civil Disobedience Movement, while a major step forward, did not immediately lead to complete independence. It was a crucial stage in the prolonged struggle, contributing to the eventual achievement of independence in 1947.  The movement's impact was significant in raising national consciousness and pressuring the British government, but independence was a culmination of many years of struggle.  Only statement 1 is accurate, making option (a) the correct answer.


**8. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Round Table Conference was boycotted by the Indian National Congress due to its refusal to accept dominion status as the ultimate goal.
2. The Second Round Table Conference saw Mahatma Gandhi as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress, leading to significant progress in constitutional negotiations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Round Table Conferences (1930-32) were a series of meetings between the British government and various Indian groups to discuss India's constitutional future.  The First Round Table Conference, held in London, was boycotted by the Indian National Congress under Gandhi's leadership because the British government was unwilling to immediately grant complete independence (Purna Swaraj). The Congress felt that dominion status was insufficient and demanded full self-rule. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi did represent the Indian National Congress at the Second Round Table Conference,  it did not lead to significant progress.  The conference was hampered by disagreements among various Indian groups regarding minority rights and safeguards.  Furthermore, the changing political landscape in Britain (the formation of a National Government) also affected the negotiations.  The outcome of the conference was far from satisfactory, failing to achieve a major breakthrough in constitutional talks. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making option (a) the correct answer.


**9. With reference to the East India Company's activities in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The East India Company initially focused on trade, but gradually expanded its political control through military conquests and alliances with Indian rulers.
2. The East India Company's administration consistently prioritized the welfare of the Indian population, leading to significant improvements in social services and infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The British East India Company's presence in India transformed from a primarily trading entity to a powerful political force.  The Company, through a combination of military victories (like the Battle of Plassey) and strategic alliances with Indian rulers, gradually expanded its influence and control over vast swathes of Indian territory. This process of expansion was often accompanied by conflict and exploitation.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. The East India Company's administration was primarily driven by profit maximization and the consolidation of British power. While some initiatives were undertaken in areas like education and infrastructure, these were often limited in scope and largely served the interests of the Company and the British elite. The Company's rule was largely exploitative, leading to economic hardship and social unrest for the Indian population.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making option (a) the correct answer.


**10.  With reference to the impact of the Communal Award and the Poona Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Communal Award, announced by Ramsay MacDonald, introduced separate electorates for various religious and caste groups, including the depressed classes.
2. The Poona Pact, negotiated between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, completely abolished the concept of reserved seats for the depressed classes within the joint electorate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Communal Award of 1932 was a controversial decision by the British government. It introduced separate electorates for various minority groups, including Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Anglo-Indians, and, significantly, the depressed classes (Dalits). This was seen as a divisive move that reinforced communal identities and potentially undermined national unity. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The Poona Pact (1932), negotiated between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, resulted from Gandhi’s fast against the Communal Award.  The pact retained reserved seats for the depressed classes but abandoned the concept of separate electorates.  The depressed classes would now participate in a joint electorate, but with a significantly increased number of reserved seats. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Only statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of the Communal Award, making option (a) the correct answer.

**1. With reference to the Charter Act of 1813, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act completely ended the East India Company's monopoly over all trade in India, paving the way for unrestricted free trade.
2.  A significant financial allocation was made to establish a nationwide network of modern, English-medium schools across India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Charter Act of 1813 did *not* completely end the East India Company's trade monopoly. While it significantly reduced the Company's exclusive trading rights, it preserved its monopoly on the lucrative tea trade with China. The Act's impact was a shift towards a more liberalized trading environment, but not complete deregulation.  The move reflected the growing influence of laissez-faire economic principles in Britain and the challenges posed by Napoleon's Continental System, which disrupted British trade routes.  However, it was a partial, not complete, dismantling of the Company's trade monopoly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1813 did allocate funds for the "revival, promotion, and encouragement of literature, learning, and science among the natives of India," specifically allocating one lakh rupees annually. However, this was not for a nationwide network of English-medium schools. The allocation was a relatively small sum and its implementation was fraught with debate and delays, largely centered around the "Orientalist-Anglicist Controversy."  This debate concerned whether to prioritize traditional Indian learning or Western education, significantly delaying the effective use of the funds. The establishment of a comprehensive, nationwide system of English-medium schools was a much later development.  The Act's contribution to education was symbolic and limited in its immediate impact.


**2. With reference to the impact of British revenue policies on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, while aiming for direct revenue collection from cultivators, inadvertently led to widespread land alienation and indebtedness due to over-assessment and inflexible tax collection methods.
2. The Permanent Settlement, intended to secure land ownership for Zamindars, resulted in the strengthening of the traditional village community structure and fostered agricultural improvements by incentivizing investment in land.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ryotwari system, implemented in parts of Madras and Bombay Presidencies, aimed at collecting land revenue directly from individual cultivators (ryots). However, it suffered from several flaws.  Initial assessments of land productivity were often inaccurate and led to overestimation of revenue, placing an unsustainable burden on ryots. The inflexible nature of the tax system meant that revenue demands remained high regardless of crop yields or market fluctuations, driving many ryots into deep debt and often leading to the loss of their land to moneylenders.  This ultimately weakened the village community structure rather than strengthening it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement, introduced in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of other regions, aimed to establish Zamindars as permanent landowners in exchange for a fixed annual revenue payment to the British. While it did provide Zamindars with secure land ownership, it did not strengthen the traditional village community. Instead, it led to the emergence of absentee landlords and subinfeudation (subletting of land), which further marginalized the peasantry. The system did not incentivize agricultural improvements as Zamindars focused primarily on rent extraction rather than investing in land improvements. The fixed revenue also prevented the British from benefiting from increased agricultural productivity.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the development of education in British India:**

1.  The Wood's Despatch of 1854 advocated for a hierarchical education system with vernacular primary schools at the base, followed by Anglo-Vernacular High Schools and affiliated colleges, culminating in universities in major cities.  This system prioritized English-medium instruction at all levels.
2. The Hunter Commission (1882-83) primarily focused on higher education, recommending significant expansion of universities and the introduction of advanced research programs to meet the growing needs of a modernizing India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Wood's Despatch of 1854 is indeed considered a landmark document in the history of education in India. It proposed a structured system starting with vernacular primary schools, progressing to Anglo-Vernacular High Schools and then to affiliated colleges, ultimately culminating in universities. However, the statement's assertion that the system prioritized English-medium instruction at *all* levels is a slight oversimplification. While English was recommended as the medium for higher education, the Despatch also emphasized the importance of vernacular languages at the primary and lower secondary levels.  The ideal was to use vernaculars as a stepping stone to English, but the implementation often favored English at lower levels as well.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hunter Commission (1882-83) did *not* primarily focus on higher education.  Its main concern was the state of primary and secondary education, which had been largely neglected in previous educational policies.  While the Commission did touch upon higher education, its recommendations primarily centered on improving the quality and expanding the reach of primary and secondary schools, particularly in rural areas. The expansion of universities and research programs was not a central focus of its report.  The commission's focus was on addressing the widespread illiteracy and improving the foundational levels of education.


**4. With reference to the British policy towards princely states, consider the following statements:**

1. The Doctrine of Lapse, a policy of annexing princely states without heirs, was rigorously pursued after the 1857 revolt to consolidate British power.
2. The British consistently promoted the modernization of princely state administrations, introducing democratic institutions and fostering self-governance to prepare them for eventual integration into a unified India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Lapse, a policy of annexing princely states lacking a direct male heir, was actually *abandoned* after the 1857 revolt. The revolt highlighted the dangers of alienating the princely states, and the British shifted to a policy of maintaining their loyalty by guaranteeing their territorial integrity and respecting their right to adopt heirs.  The post-1857 policy aimed at using the princely states as a bulwark against future uprisings, not annexing them.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British did encourage some administrative modernization in princely states, it was primarily to enhance their control and ensure their continued subservience to British authority (paramountcy).  The British did not genuinely foster self-governance or democratic institutions.  Modernization efforts were selective and often served to strengthen the existing autocratic structures within the princely states, making them more efficient instruments of British policy.  The British sought to maintain a balance between utilizing the princely states and limiting their potential threat to their rule.  The focus was on control, not genuine self-governance.

**1. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress initially focused primarily on constitutional methods, advocating for reforms through petitions and representations to the British government.
2.  The Congress's early membership base consisted predominantly of wealthy and aristocratic Indians, with limited representation from the broader masses.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905) is characterized by its reliance on constitutional methods of political action.  The Congress leaders, largely drawn from the educated elite, believed in working within the existing political framework to achieve their objectives.  Their primary strategy involved submitting petitions and making representations to the British government, advocating for administrative and legislative reforms.  They aimed to influence British policy through reasoned arguments and appeals, rather than through mass mobilization or direct confrontation.  This approach, while effective in raising awareness and articulating Indian grievances, also limited the Congress's reach and impact on the broader population.

Statement 2 is also correct. The early Congress was predominantly composed of wealthy and aristocratic Indians.  These individuals, often landowners, lawyers, and professionals, had the resources, education, and social standing to participate actively in politics.  Their dominance in the Congress leadership and membership reflected the socio-economic realities of the time, limiting the organization's initial reach among the peasantry and working classes.  This limited representation of the masses is a key aspect of the Congress's early development, highlighting its elitist character. While the Congress aimed to represent all Indians, its initial composition and focus reflected the existing power structures within Indian society.


**2. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms significantly increased the number of directly elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council and provincial councils.
2.  The reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, granting them a degree of independent representation in legislative bodies.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Morley-Minto Reforms did increase the number of elected members in legislative councils, a significant portion were still elected indirectly.  The reforms aimed to increase Indian participation in governance but fell short of granting widespread direct representation. The indirect election process meant that many members were chosen by smaller, select groups rather than through direct popular vote. This limited the extent to which the reforms truly democratized the legislative process.  The indirect election system was a key feature of the reforms and reflected the British government's cautious approach to devolving power.

Statement 2 is correct.  A defining feature of the Morley-Minto Reforms was the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims.  This provision allowed Muslim communities to elect their representatives to legislative bodies independently of the general electorate.  While intended to address Muslim concerns about representation, the creation of separate electorates also had the unintended consequence of reinforcing communal divisions within Indian politics. The decision to establish separate electorates had long-term implications, shaping the political landscape in India and contributing to the growth of communal politics.  It was a controversial element of the reforms and remains a subject of debate among historians.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the militant nationalists in India during the early 20th century:**

1.  Militant nationalists, unlike their moderate counterparts, unequivocally advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) from British rule.
2.  The militant nationalist movement was characterized by its effective organization and widespread mobilization of the peasantry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A crucial distinction between militant nationalists and their moderate counterparts lay in their ultimate political goal. While moderate nationalists primarily sought gradual reforms within the existing British framework, militant nationalists openly championed complete independence from British rule.  This vision of Purna Swaraj, or complete self-rule, represented a fundamental shift in the nationalist movement's objectives.  It signaled a departure from the more conciliatory approach of the moderates and reflected a growing impatience with the slow pace of reform. The demand for complete independence became a rallying cry for a new generation of nationalists and marked a significant turning point in the struggle for Indian freedom.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Despite their radical ideology, the militant nationalist movement lacked the organizational strength and popular base to effectively mobilize the peasantry. Their movement, while impactful in certain urban centers, failed to penetrate deeply into rural areas. This limited their ability to generate widespread mass support and ultimately constrained their political influence.  The movement's limited reach among the peasantry was a significant factor in its eventual decline, highlighting the challenges of mobilizing a diverse population across different social and geographical contexts.


**4. With reference to the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement was implemented by Lord Cornwallis, aiming to create a stable and predictable revenue system.
2.  Under the Permanent Settlement, the Zamindars were granted ownership rights over the land, collecting revenue and paying a fixed amount to the British.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Permanent Settlement, a landmark land revenue system in British India, was implemented by Lord Cornwallis in 1793.  The primary aim of the settlement was to create a stable and predictable revenue system for the British East India Company.  By establishing fixed revenue demands on Zamindars (landlords), the Company hoped to secure a consistent income stream and eliminate the uncertainties associated with previous revenue collection methods.  The Permanent Settlement was a significant policy decision with far-reaching consequences for the agrarian economy of Bengal.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A defining feature of the Permanent Settlement was the grant of ownership rights to the Zamindars.  The Zamindars were tasked with collecting revenue from the peasants and remitting a fixed share to the British government.  While this created a degree of stability in revenue collection for the British, it also had negative consequences for the peasants, many of whom were subjected to high taxes and oppressive practices by the Zamindars. The Permanent Settlement's impact on land ownership and revenue collection had a profound and lasting impact on the social and economic structure of Bengal.  The system's strengths and weaknesses continue to be debated among historians and economists.


**5. With reference to the social and cultural life of 18th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The caste system, characterized by rigid social hierarchies and restrictions, was predominantly prevalent among Hindus but had limited influence on Muslim society.
2.  Sati, the practice of widow immolation, was widely prevalent across India, irrespective of regional or religious differences.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the caste system was a dominant feature of Hindu social life in 18th-century India, its influence extended beyond the Hindu community.  Although Islam theoretically promoted social equality, various social hierarchies and distinctions existed within Muslim society, often based on factors such as ethnicity, lineage, and occupation.  These distinctions, while not identical to the caste system, played a significant role in shaping social relations and power dynamics within Muslim communities. The assertion that the caste system had limited influence on Muslim society overlooks the complex social structures and hierarchies present within various Muslim groups.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sati, the practice of a Hindu widow burning herself on her husband's funeral pyre, was not uniformly prevalent across India. While it was more common in certain regions, such as Bengal and Rajputana, it was less prevalent in other parts of the country.  Furthermore, the practice was not limited to Hindu society;  analogous practices existed within certain Muslim communities, although not identical to Sati. The statement's claim of widespread prevalence irrespective of regional or religious differences ignores the variations in the practice and its uneven geographical distribution.

**1. With reference to the Permanent Settlement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented in 1793, granted proprietary rights to Zamindars in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, establishing a fixed tax revenue system for the British East India Company.
2.  Philip Francis initially proposed the Permanent Settlement in 1776, aiming to stabilize land revenue collection and foster economic development in the affected regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in 1793 under Lord Cornwallis, did grant Zamindars proprietary rights over their lands in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.  A fixed revenue was established, payable to the British East India Company.  However, the system's impact was far more complex than a simple "stabilization" and "economic development". It led to the impoverishment of the peasantry and created a rigid social hierarchy. The system also didn't extend to all regions uniformly.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the idea of a permanent settlement was discussed before 1793,  the claim that Philip Francis proposed it in 1776 with the explicit aims mentioned is an oversimplification. Several officials, including Francis, Shore, and Grant, examined various revenue systems before the Permanent Settlement's final implementation.  The initial proposals were far from uniform and didn't necessarily focus on the specific aims stated. The 1776 date might refer to an early discussion or proposal, but not a fully formed plan as described.  The actual implementation was a gradual process, evolving through various stages of deliberation and modification.


**2. With reference to the impact of British educational policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Charter Act of 1813 allocated one lakh rupees annually for the promotion of education in India, marking the first significant government investment in modern education.
2. Lord Macaulay's Minute of 1835 advocated for a Western-style education system in India, emphasizing the teaching of English and Western literature over traditional Indian learning, a policy that contributed to the creation of an Indian elite class loyal to the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Charter Act of 1813 did indeed allocate one lakh rupees annually for the promotion of education, although the funds were not consistently provided immediately. This marked a crucial, albeit small, initial step by the British government towards formalizing educational policies in India.


Statement 2 is also largely correct.  Lord Macaulay's Minute of 1835 did indeed prioritize Western education through the English language, downplaying traditional Indian learning. This approach did contribute to the creation of an Indian elite class proficient in English and Western thought.  However, the degree of loyalty to the British among this class was complex and varied, and the statement simplifies a multifaceted historical process.  It's important to note that this policy also had significant unintended consequences,  creating a class divide and hindering the spread of education to the masses.


**3. With reference to the Vernacular Press Act of 1878, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vernacular Press Act, introduced by Lord Lytton, aimed to control seditious writing in Indian-language newspapers, empowering district magistrates to demand security bonds from publishers and seize printing presses for perceived offenses.
2.  Lord Ripon, succeeding Lord Lytton, repealed the Vernacular Press Act in 1882, demonstrating a shift towards a more liberal press policy and acknowledging the importance of freedom of expression in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key features of the Vernacular Press Act of 1878.  Lord Lytton's administration, facing growing nationalist sentiment expressed through the vernacular press, implemented this restrictive law.  District magistrates were given considerable power to suppress publications deemed critical of the government.  The act was widely criticized for its discriminatory nature and lack of judicial oversight.


Statement 2 is also correct. Lord Ripon, known for his relatively liberal policies, repealed the Vernacular Press Act in 1882. This action reflected a change in approach, albeit a temporary one, towards greater freedom of the press.  It's important to note that the repeal was a response to widespread criticism of the Act's repressive nature and its impact on freedom of speech.  However, subsequent measures continued to restrict press freedom at various points in British India's history.


**4. With reference to Dadabhai Naoroji's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, is best known for his articulation of the "Drain of Wealth" theory, highlighting the economic exploitation of India under British rule.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji served as the President of the Indian National Congress on multiple occasions, showcasing his significant influence within the early nationalist movement and his commitment to Swaraj.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Dadabhai Naoroji's significant contribution to Indian nationalism. His articulation of the "Drain of Wealth" theory provided a powerful economic argument against British rule, demonstrating how British policies systematically extracted resources from India, hindering its economic development. This theory significantly influenced nationalist thought and activism.


Statement 2 is also correct.  Dadabhai Naoroji held the presidency of the Indian National Congress on multiple occasions, demonstrating his leadership role in the early years of the movement. His presidency reflected his influence and standing within the Congress and his advocacy for self-rule (Swaraj).  His leadership symbolized the growing voice of Indian nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.


**5.  With reference to the impact of British educational policies on women, consider the following statements:**

1. The Wood's Despatch of 1854, while advocating for the expansion of education in India, significantly neglected the education of girls, reflecting prevailing societal attitudes and the limited perceived utility of female education within the colonial administration.
2. The Bethune School, established in Calcutta in 1849,  represented an early and significant effort to promote the education of girls in India, despite facing considerable resistance from conservative elements within Indian society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately captures a crucial aspect of British educational policies. While Wood's Despatch of 1854 aimed for educational expansion, its provisions for girls' education were limited, reflecting both the colonial administration's priorities and the prevalent social norms that devalued women's education.  The lack of significant investment in girls' education contributed to persistent gender inequality in access to education.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Bethune School serves as a notable example of early efforts to promote girls' education.  Established by J.E.D. Bethune, it played a pivotal role in challenging conservative attitudes and creating opportunities for girls' education, though it was a relatively small-scale initiative compared to the overall neglect of women's education within the broader British educational system.  Its establishment highlights the presence of progressive voices advocating for female education, even within the context of limited government support.

**1. With reference to Dadabhai Naoroji's contributions to Indian nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji, while advocating for self-government, simultaneously emphasized the importance of maintaining friendly relations with the British government, believing that gradual reform was more effective than immediate confrontation.
2.  Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory primarily focused on the negative impact of British economic policies on Indian agriculture, arguing that excessive taxation on land revenue led to widespread rural poverty.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent leader of the Moderate phase of the Indian National Congress, believed in constitutional methods and gradual reform. While advocating for Swaraj (self-rule), his approach was not one of immediate and aggressive confrontation with the British. He believed in persuading the British government through reasoned arguments and appeals to justice and fairness. His strategy involved building public opinion both in India and Britain to pressure the government for reforms.  He  utilized his position as a Member of Parliament in Britain to present the Indian perspective effectively.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory did highlight the negative impact of British economic policies on India, its focus wasn't solely on agriculture.  His analysis encompassed a broader range of exploitative practices, including the transfer of India's wealth to Britain through unfair trade practices, excessive taxation (not limited to land revenue), and the repatriation of profits by British companies. He argued that this systematic extraction of wealth from India was the root cause of widespread poverty, affecting various sectors of the Indian economy, not just agriculture. The theory highlighted the systemic nature of British economic exploitation, showing how it hindered India's economic development and contributed to its impoverishment.


**2. With reference to the early nationalist organizations in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, primarily a platform for educated elites, focused its efforts on advocating for administrative reforms and the expansion of Western-style education in India, largely neglecting the concerns of the rural peasantry.
2. The Indian Association, founded in Calcutta, actively championed the cause of Indian workers in tea plantations and other industries, advocating for improved working conditions and wages, thereby broadening the base of the nationalist movement beyond the elite.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplifies the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha's role. While it was indeed dominated by educated elites and focused on administrative and educational reforms, it wasn't entirely oblivious to the plight of the peasantry.  Its activities included addressing issues related to land revenue and agrarian distress, although perhaps not with the same intensity as other organizations.  The statement's assertion that it *largely neglected* the peasantry is an overstatement.

Statement 2 is more accurate. The Indian Association, under the leadership of Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose, significantly broadened the scope of early nationalism.  Unlike some organizations that primarily focused on the concerns of the educated elite, the Indian Association actively took up the cause of Indian workers, particularly those facing exploitative conditions in industries like tea plantations. This advocacy for workers' rights helped to expand the nationalist movement's base beyond the limited circle of wealthy and influential individuals, demonstrating a concern for the broader socio-economic issues faced by the Indian population.  This proactive engagement with the working class contributed to a more inclusive and representative nationalist movement.


**3. With reference to the role of newspapers in the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  *Kesari*, edited by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, primarily focused on promoting a moderate and constitutional approach to achieving self-rule, emphasizing dialogue and peaceful negotiation with the British government.
2.  *Amrita Bazar Patrika* played a crucial role in galvanizing public opinion against the arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, highlighting the government's suppression of freedom of speech and the press.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. *Kesari*, edited by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, was known for its strong nationalist stance and advocacy of a more assertive and at times, militant approach to achieving Swaraj. While Tilak's early career involved some constitutional activities, *Kesari* often employed a more aggressive tone and advocated for methods that extended beyond the purely constitutional means favored by the Moderates.  Tilak's use of Ganapati and Shivaji festivals as tools for mobilizing nationalist sentiment is a testament to this more assertive approach.

Statement 2 is correct. *Amrita Bazar Patrika* was a leading nationalist newspaper that played a significant role in shaping public opinion.  Following Tilak's arrest in 1897, the newspaper strongly condemned the British government's actions, highlighting the attack on freedom of speech and the press. This condemnation helped to galvanize public opinion against the government's repressive measures and contributed to the growing nationalist sentiment across India. The newspaper's coverage of the event, and its outspoken criticism, solidified its position as a powerful voice in the nationalist struggle.


**4. With reference to the Government of India Act 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced the principle of communal representation, granting separate electorates to Muslims, but not to other religious minorities in India, thereby exacerbating existing communal tensions.
2.  The Act significantly expanded the legislative councils at both the central and provincial levels, granting Indians greater participation in the legislative process, and thereby significantly increasing Indian influence in the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 are significant for introducing the principle of communal representation, a controversial policy that would have far-reaching consequences.  While the reforms granted separate electorates to Muslims, allowing them to elect their representatives separately from other communities, it did not extend this privilege to other religious minorities. This decision, aimed at garnering Muslim support for the British Raj, ultimately contributed to the exacerbation of communal tensions and divisions within Indian society.  The policy of separate electorates would later be a contributing factor to the partition of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 1909 Act did expand the legislative councils, the increase in Indian representation was limited and did not significantly increase Indian influence in the government.  The British retained ultimate control over the legislative process, and the expanded councils still lacked substantial power.  The reforms were a minor step towards greater Indian participation, but they fell far short of granting substantial self-governance or significantly altering the power dynamics within the colonial administration.  The changes were primarily symbolic and did little to address the core concerns of Indian nationalists.

**1. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent leader of the Congress, advocated for complete independence from British rule immediately.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address, explicitly called for "self-government" or Swaraj, similar to that of the United Kingdom or its colonies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, while a staunch nationalist, was a leader of the Moderates within the Congress.  The Moderates favored gradual reforms and constitutional means to achieve self-rule, not immediate and complete independence. Their methods primarily involved petitions, reasoned arguments, and appeals to British conscience.  Their approach differed significantly from the later Extremists who advocated more assertive and radical methods.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address to the Indian National Congress, explicitly articulated the goal of "self-government" or Swaraj, drawing a parallel with the self-governing status of the United Kingdom and its colonies. This marked a significant moment in the evolution of the Congress's political aspirations, clearly setting a goal beyond mere administrative reforms.  His demand was for a dominion status similar to that enjoyed by Canada or Australia, not necessarily full independence immediately.


**2. With reference to the activities of Annie Besant, consider the following statements:**

1. Annie Besant's Home Rule Movement primarily focused on achieving complete independence from British rule through armed rebellion.
2. Annie Besant actively collaborated with Bal Gangadhar Tilak and played a key role in the Home Rule League, advocating for self-rule within the framework of the British Empire.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Annie Besant was a strong advocate for Indian self-rule, the Home Rule Movement she spearheaded did not aim for complete independence through armed rebellion.  Her approach was primarily constitutional and focused on mobilizing public opinion and pressure to achieve self-governance within the British Empire, similar to the Home Rule movements in Ireland.  The movement utilized methods such as public meetings, petitions, and propaganda to achieve its aims.

Statement 2 is correct. Annie Besant collaborated closely with Bal Gangadhar Tilak in the Home Rule Movement.  They formed separate but parallel Home Rule Leagues, working towards the common goal of achieving greater self-government for India.  Besant's leadership and organizational skills proved crucial in galvanizing support for the movement across various segments of Indian society. The collaboration between Besant and Tilak was a significant example of cooperation between Moderates and Extremists during this period.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced the principle of diarchy, dividing governmental power between elected Indian ministers and appointed British officials at the provincial level, but not at the central level.
2.  The Act significantly expanded the franchise, granting voting rights to a substantially larger portion of the Indian population, including a significant number of women.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced the system of diarchy at the provincial level.  This meant that certain subjects were transferred to the control of Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures, while other "reserved" subjects remained under the direct control of British officials. This dual system of governance was a crucial step in the gradual devolution of power, but it was limited to the provinces; the central government remained firmly under British control.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 1919 Act did expand the franchise compared to previous legislation, it did not grant voting rights to a substantially large portion of the Indian population, and it did not include a significant number of women.  The franchise remained limited, primarily based on property qualifications, which excluded the vast majority of the Indian population.  The expansion of suffrage was a gradual process, with significant increases coming later with the 1935 Act.


**4.  With reference to the impact of British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, while intending to secure a stable revenue stream for the British, inadvertently led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few zamindars and the exploitation of ryots.
2. The Ryotwari System, by directly collecting revenue from individual cultivators, successfully prevented the emergence of powerful intermediaries and ensured equitable distribution of land and prosperity among the peasantry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, aimed to create a fixed and predictable revenue source for the British East India Company. However, it had unintended consequences.  By granting zamindars proprietary rights over land, it led to the concentration of land ownership and the emergence of a powerful landlord class.  This, in turn, resulted in the exploitation of the actual cultivators (ryots), who were often forced into tenancy and subjected to high rents and various forms of oppression.  The system hindered agricultural improvements and exacerbated rural poverty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ryotwari System, implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, aimed to collect revenue directly from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries like zamindars. While this approach did reduce the power of some intermediaries, it did not ensure equitable land distribution or widespread prosperity among the peasantry.  The system often suffered from overassessment of land revenue, leading to widespread rural indebtedness and peasant hardship.  The arbitrary fixing of revenue and lack of consideration for fluctuations in agricultural yields contributed to widespread poverty and landlessness.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist newspapers in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The newspaper "Sudharak," edited by Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, primarily focused on promoting religious harmony and discouraging social reform movements.
2.  "Young India," edited by Mahatma Gandhi, played a crucial role in disseminating Gandhian philosophy and mobilizing support for the Non-Cooperation Movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  "Sudharak," edited by Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, was a prominent Marathi-language newspaper that actively championed social reform. It played a vital role in advocating for social change, particularly against issues like untouchability and caste discrimination.  It promoted progressive ideas and was not focused on religious harmony at the expense of social reform.

Statement 2 is correct. "Young India," a weekly newspaper founded by Mahatma Gandhi, became a powerful platform for communicating his philosophy of Satyagraha and advocating for various nationalist causes, including the Non-Cooperation Movement.  It played a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing popular support for Gandhi's campaigns.  The newspaper's clear and concise style helped in disseminating Gandhi's ideas to a wide audience.

**1. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British India Association, formed in 1851, was a merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, primarily advocating for landlord interests.
2. The Indian Association, founded in 1876, focused on broader public interests, including civil service reforms and tenant rights, employing a lower membership fee to attract wider participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the early nationalist movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the British India Association as a product of the merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society in 1851. While the initial focus was on landlord interests, it's important to note that the Association's scope broadened over time to encompass broader concerns. The Landholders' Society, established in 1837, primarily represented the interests of Bengali landlords, reflecting the socio-political context of the time where land ownership held significant power. The Bengal British Indian Society, established in 1843, aimed to address public concerns more broadly. The amalgamation of these two groups into the British India Association marked a step towards a more unified approach to addressing administrative and political issues.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Indian Association, founded in 1876 under the leadership of Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose.  It significantly differed from its predecessors by advocating for broader public interests and employing a more inclusive membership strategy with a low fee to encompass a wider range of the population.  This strategy reflects a shift towards a more mass-based movement, contrasting with the earlier organizations that were largely dominated by wealthy and aristocratic individuals.  The Indian Association's activism on issues like civil service reforms and tenant rights demonstrates its commitment to addressing the concerns of a larger segment of Indian society.  Therefore, both statements are factually correct and represent distinct but interconnected phases in the evolution of the early nationalist movement.


**2. With reference to the impact of the 1857 revolt, consider the following statements:**

1. The revolt directly led to the immediate establishment of universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, reflecting a British policy shift towards expanding modern education.
2. The 14 percent white army policy, preceding the 1857 revolt, was directly responsible for the widespread peasant uprisings that followed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements present inaccurate or oversimplified causal relationships. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1857 revolt did contribute to a reevaluation of British policies in India, the establishment of universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras occurred later and was part of a broader, gradual process of educational reform driven by various factors beyond the immediate aftermath of the revolt.  The British were already engaged in expanding education before 1857, albeit at a limited scale. The establishment of these universities was a significant step, but it wasn't a direct or immediate consequence of the 1857 revolt.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The 14 percent white army policy, while contributing to tensions and discontent, was not the sole or even primary cause of the widespread peasant uprisings that accompanied the 1857 revolt. The revolt was a complex event with multiple underlying causes, including widespread socio-economic grievances, resentment towards British policies, and the perceived threat to religious and cultural practices. While the army's composition played a role, attributing the peasant uprisings solely to this policy is an oversimplification.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the complex causal relationships surrounding the 1857 revolt and its aftermath.


**3. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1892, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act significantly increased Indian representation in the Imperial Legislative Council and Provincial Legislative Councils, granting Indians a substantial majority in these bodies.
2. The Act introduced a system of direct elections for Indian members to the councils, marking a significant step towards greater democratic participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements misrepresent key aspects of the Indian Councils Act of 1892. Statement 1 is incorrect because, while the Act did increase the number of members in both the Imperial and Provincial Legislative Councils, it did *not* grant Indians a substantial majority.  The Act maintained an official majority, ensuring that the British retained control over the legislative process. The increase in Indian representation was a modest step, falling far short of the demands of Indian nationalists for greater self-governance.  The Act's limited nature was a source of considerable frustration for Indian nationalists who viewed it as inadequate in addressing their demands for greater political participation.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Act introduced an element of *indirect* elections for some Indian members, not direct elections. This indirect system involved elections through various constituencies, often with limited franchise, falling short of universal suffrage. The limited nature of the electoral system further highlighted the constraints on Indian participation in the legislative process. The Act represented a cautious and incremental approach to political reform by the British, falling far short of the demands for greater democratic representation expressed by Indian nationalists.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the provisions and impact of the Indian Councils Act of 1892.


**4. With reference to the Permanent Settlement and Ryotwari Systems of land revenue, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, implemented primarily in Bengal, directly granted land ownership to individual cultivators (ryots), fostering greater economic independence among the peasantry.
2. The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Madras, established a fixed revenue demand on the Zamindars, leading to the consolidation of land ownership in their hands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the implementation and characteristics of the Permanent Settlement and Ryotwari systems. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ryotwari system was primarily implemented in Madras Presidency (and other regions), not Bengal.  While it did deal directly with individual cultivators (ryots), it did *not* grant them outright land ownership.  Instead, it established a system where ryots paid revenue directly to the state, and their rights to the land were contingent upon the timely payment of this revenue.  This system had significant implications for the economic status of the peasantry, often leading to indebtedness and vulnerability.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Permanent Settlement was implemented in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of Orissa, not Madras.  While it did establish a fixed revenue demand on the Zamindars, it did *not* lead to the simple consolidation of land ownership in their hands.  The Zamindars' rights were hereditary, but their power was subject to various regulations and the system ultimately led to a complex land tenure system with its own set of issues and consequences. The system created a class of intermediaries (Zamindars) between the state and the cultivators, leading to exploitation and inequality. Therefore, neither statement accurately describes the geographical implementation or the core features of these two significant land revenue systems.


**5. With reference to the Indian National Congress's early years (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji, in his writings, primarily focused on advocating for immediate complete independence from British rule, rejecting any form of gradualism or cooperation with the colonial administration.
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent early Congress leader, primarily championed the cause of Indianisation of the higher echelons of the civil services, emphasizing the need to end the European monopoly of these positions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 misrepresents Dadabhai Naoroji's position. While he was a staunch critic of British rule and exposed the economic exploitation of India, his approach was not one of demanding immediate complete independence.  He advocated for a gradual increase in Indian participation in governance and self-rule within the British Empire.  His focus was on exposing the drain of wealth from India to Britain and advocating for economic reforms as key steps towards achieving greater autonomy and self-governance. His approach was more gradualist and reformist compared to later more radical nationalist leaders.

Statement 2 accurately reflects Gopal Krishna Gokhale's key concerns.  He was a prominent advocate for the Indianisation of the higher civil services, arguing that the European monopoly of these positions was economically inefficient, politically unjust, and morally degrading for Indians. He effectively articulated the need for greater Indian representation in administration to ensure better responsiveness to Indian needs and aspirations. His arguments were based on both economic and moral grounds, highlighting the detrimental effects of the existing system on Indian society. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. With reference to the Ilbert Bill, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Ripon introduced the Ilbert Bill, aiming to grant Indian judges the authority to try European British citizens.
2.  The Ilbert Bill faced significant opposition from the British community in India, primarily due to concerns about racial equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ilbert Bill, introduced by Lord Ripon in 1883, aimed to remove the existing legal discrimination whereby Indian judges could not try European British offenders.  This was a significant step towards legal equality, though it was ultimately modified due to intense opposition.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While the British community in India did strongly oppose the Ilbert Bill, their opposition stemmed not primarily from concerns about racial equality but from their desire to maintain their privileged position within the colonial legal system.  They feared a loss of their perceived judicial immunity and not necessarily a lack of belief in racial equality. The opposition highlighted the inherent racial biases within the colonial administration and the deep-seated inequalities of the system, even if the stated reasons were different.  The opposition was rooted in maintaining the power imbalance, not a genuine concern for racial justice.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Lord Ripon's tenure as Viceroy of India:**

1.  Lord Ripon's administration witnessed the establishment of Punjab University in 1882.
2.  Lord Ripon is widely acknowledged for his significant contributions to the development of local self-government in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. Lord Ripon's tenure (1880-1884) saw the establishment of Punjab University in 1882, reflecting his commitment to educational expansion.  Furthermore, his introduction and promotion of local self-government institutions, through his resolution, earned him the title "father of local self-government in India." This initiative aimed to decentralize administrative power and involve Indians more directly in governance, a significant step in the evolution of Indian political thought and practice.  His reforms, although limited in scope by the constraints of colonial rule, laid a crucial foundation for future developments in local governance.


**3. With reference to Lord Curzon's policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Curzon's administration oversaw the annexation of Burma in 1905.
2.  Lord Curzon's approach to Indian governance emphasized increased official control and a stricter interpretation of the British imperial role.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lord Curzon was Viceroy of India during a period of significant expansion, the annexation of Burma actually occurred in 1885, preceding his tenure.  This highlights the importance of precise chronological knowledge in understanding the complexities of British imperial expansion in Asia.

Statement 2 is correct. Lord Curzon's policies reflected a strong belief in centralized administrative authority and a robust assertion of British power. His actions, including the establishment of the Police Commission and his emphasis on official control, demonstrate this conviction.  His interpretation of "ultimate self-government" was a carefully managed strategy to maintain British dominance while offering a seemingly progressive vision. This approach reveals the nuances of imperial strategies, which sought to control and manage the growing nationalist sentiments while maintaining colonial authority.


**4. With reference to the Vernacular Press Act (VPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The VPA, enacted in 1878, was repealed during Lord Lytton's viceroyalty.
2. The repeal of the VPA in 1882 is associated with the administration of Lord Ripon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Vernacular Press Act (VPA) of 1878, which imposed restrictions on the Indian-language press, was enacted during Lord Lytton's viceroyalty but was repealed during Lord Ripon's administration. This shows the contrasting approaches of these two viceroys towards freedom of the press and the evolving nature of British colonial policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The repeal of the VPA in 1882 is a key element of Lord Ripon's legacy, demonstrating a more liberal approach than his predecessor.  This act reflects the impact of public pressure and the growing nationalist sentiment in influencing colonial policy.  The repeal, while not entirely removing press restrictions, signaled a move towards greater freedom of expression.


**5. With reference to the early phases of the Indian National Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bombay Presidency Association, founded in 1885, predates the establishment of the Indian National Congress.
2.  The Indian Association of Calcutta played a crucial role in advocating for reforms in the Indian Civil Service and the age limit for its examinations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian National Congress was founded in December 1885, and the Bombay Presidency Association was also founded in the same year.  Therefore, they are contemporaries, not chronologically distinct.  This illustrates the simultaneous emergence of several organizations advocating for Indian interests during this period.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Association of Calcutta, established in 1876, actively campaigned for reforms in the Indian Civil Service, including raising the age limit for examinations. This was a significant early step in challenging the discriminatory practices of the colonial administration.  Their efforts demonstrate the early stages of organized political activity in India, focusing on issues of access to higher education and employment opportunities within the colonial system.


**6. With reference to the Subsidiary Alliance System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Subsidiary Alliance System, implemented by Lord Wellesley, aimed to counter the influence of the French in India.
2. Under the Subsidiary Alliance System, the allied Indian states retained complete autonomy in matters of foreign policy and warfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Wellesley's Subsidiary Alliance System was a key element of British expansionist strategy in India.  Its primary aim was to prevent the resurgence of French influence, which had been a major threat during earlier periods.  This system effectively brought many Indian states under British control.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Subsidiary Alliance System fundamentally undermined the autonomy of the allied Indian states. While the British promised protection, this came at the cost of significant control over their foreign policy and military affairs.  The allied states were obliged to maintain a British military contingent, which was a significant drain on their resources and effectively subordinated their sovereignty to the British.  This system is a prime example of how the British strategically used alliances to consolidate their power while presenting them as mutually beneficial arrangements.


**7. With reference to the  introduction of compulsory primary education in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Gopal Krishna Gokhale introduced a bill in the Imperial Legislative Council in 1911 advocating for compulsory and free primary education.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent advocate for compulsory and free primary education in India during the early 20th century.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a strong advocate for education reform, the bill for compulsory and free primary education in 1911 was introduced by Sir Harcourt Butler in the Imperial Legislative Council, not Gokhale. This question highlights the importance of knowing the specific individuals associated with key legislative proposals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Dadabhai Naoroji was a significant figure in the Indian National Congress and championed various social reforms, he is not primarily known for advocating for compulsory and free primary education in the early 20th century.  Other leaders like Gokhale were more actively involved in promoting educational reforms during this time.  This demonstrates the importance of understanding the diverse contributions of various nationalist leaders to the broader movement for social and political change.


**8.  With reference to the Act V of 1843 concerning slavery in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Act V of 1843 legally permitted slave owners to confine their slaves to their estates.
2. Act V of 1843 significantly limited the ability of slave owners to use courts to enforce their claims on slaves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Act V of 1843, while not completely abolishing slavery, aimed to gradually dismantle the institution.  It did not grant slave owners the right to forcefully confine slaves to their estates.  The act aimed at weakening the institution of slavery through legal measures rather than outright abolition.

Statement 2 is correct.  Act V of 1843 significantly restricted the legal avenues available to slave owners to assert their claims on slaves. This was a crucial step in undermining the institution of slavery by limiting the legal power of slaveholders.  The act sought to curb the ability of slave owners to exploit the legal system to maintain their control over enslaved people.  This demonstrates the gradualist approach taken by the British government in addressing the issue of slavery in India and the complexities of colonial legal reforms.


**9. With reference to the Delhi Manifesto of 1929, consider the following statements:**

1. The Delhi Manifesto demanded that the Round Table Conference prioritize the immediate acceptance of dominion status as a basic principle.
2. The Delhi Manifesto stipulated that the Indian National Congress should hold majority representation at the Round Table Conference.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Delhi Manifesto, issued in November 1929, articulated key demands for participation in the Round Table Conferences.  It insisted that dominion status be accepted as a fundamental principle before any discussion about its implementation.  It also demanded that the Indian National Congress have a majority of seats at the conference, reflecting the growing confidence and assertiveness of the nationalist movement.  This highlights the strategic approach of the nationalists in demanding a significant voice in shaping the future of India’s political status.  The Manifesto's demands reflect the changing political landscape and the growing pressure on the British government to negotiate with the Indian National Congress on an equal footing.


**10. With reference to the Lahore Congress Session of 1929, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lahore Congress Session, under the presidency of Motilal Nehru, formally declared Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as the goal of the Indian National Congress.
2. The Lahore Congress Session definitively endorsed the boycott of the Round Table Conferences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Lahore Congress Session of 1929 did declare Purna Swaraj as the goal of the Indian National Congress, it was under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, not Motilal Nehru.  This question tests the knowledge of key figures and their roles within the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lahore Congress Session unequivocally decided to boycott the Round Table Conferences, signifying a shift towards more assertive and uncompromising methods in the pursuit of independence.  The decision to boycott reflects the growing dissatisfaction with the British government's reluctance to grant substantial concessions and the strengthening of the resolve for complete independence.  The boycott also signaled the beginning of a more confrontational phase of the nationalist struggle.



**11. With reference to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact resulted in the unconditional release of all political prisoners, regardless of their involvement in violence.
2.  The Gandhi-Irwin Pact secured the immediate restoration of all confiscated lands to the peasants.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact secured the release of political prisoners *not* convicted of violence.  Those involved in violent acts were excluded from the amnesty. The pact shows the limitations of non-violent resistance and the complexities of negotiating with a colonial power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact agreed to the return of confiscated lands, but this was conditional and did not guarantee their immediate restoration.  The restoration process was protracted, leading to continued discontent among some sections of the population.  The pact showcases the limitations of negotiations in achieving immediate and complete redressal of grievances.  The delayed restoration of lands also reveals the challenges of translating political agreements into concrete social changes.


**12. With reference to the Communal Award of 1932, consider the following statements:**

1. The Communal Award established separate electorates for Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians but not for the Depressed Classes.
2. The Communal Award was a direct response to demands for separate electorates made by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Communal Award of 1932 established separate electorates for various religious and social groups, *including* the Depressed Classes (Scheduled Castes).  This award is a significant example of the British policy of divide and rule, aimed at fragmenting the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is partially correct but incomplete. While Dr. B.R. Ambedkar advocated for separate electorates for the Depressed Classes, the Communal Award was not solely a response to his demands.  It was a broader measure aimed at addressing the concerns of various minority groups, many of whom had been lobbying for separate representation for years. The award was a complex political decision reflecting the intricate dynamics of British colonial rule in India.


**13.  With reference to the Poona Pact of 1932, consider the following statements:**

1. The Poona Pact retained the system of separate electorates for the Depressed Classes but increased their reserved seats.
2. The Poona Pact was signed by Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, ending Gandhi's fast unto death.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Poona Pact, a crucial agreement reached in 1932, *abolished* the system of separate electorates for the Depressed Classes, replacing it with an increased number of reserved seats within a joint electorate. This decision aimed at maintaining Hindu unity while providing greater political representation for the Depressed Classes.

Statement 2 is partially correct but not entirely accurate.  While the Poona Pact did end Gandhi's fast unto death, it was signed by B.R. Ambedkar on behalf of the Depressed Classes and representatives of the Congress, not directly by Gandhi himself.   The pact represents a significant compromise between different factions within the Indian nationalist movement and demonstrates the impact of Gandhi’s actions on political negotiations during the period.  It also highlights the complexities of addressing the issue of caste discrimination through political means.


**14. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Round Table Conference was boycotted by the Indian National Congress, but the Second Round Table Conference was attended by Mahatma Gandhi as the sole representative of the Congress.
2. The Round Table Conferences resulted in the immediate establishment of a fully responsible government in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The First Round Table Conference (1930-1931) was boycotted by the Indian National Congress due to its dissatisfaction with the British government's approach. However, following the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, the Second Round Table Conference (1931) saw Mahatma Gandhi as the sole representative of the Congress. This indicates the fluctuating relationship between the Congress and the British government during the period, as well as the significance of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact in bringing the Congress back into negotiations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Round Table Conferences, while involving significant discussions about India's constitutional future, did not lead to the immediate establishment of a fully responsible government.  The conferences resulted in limited progress, and the process of constitutional reform continued for several years.  The outcome of the conferences highlights the limitations of negotiations in achieving immediate political goals.  The failure to establish a fully responsible government is a crucial aspect of the history of the independence movement.

**1. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1919, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act introduced the principle of dyarchy, dividing subjects into transferred and reserved categories in the provinces.
2.  The Act significantly expanded the franchise, granting voting rights to a substantial portion of the Indian male population.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1919, a landmark piece of legislation, introduced the system of dyarchy in the provinces.  This system divided administrative subjects into two categories: "transferred" subjects, which were to be administered by Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures, and "reserved" subjects, which remained under the direct control of the Governor and the British bureaucracy. This represented a cautious step towards self-government, albeit a limited one.  The implementation of dyarchy was a key feature of the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, which formed the basis for the 1919 Act.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 1919 Act did expand the franchise compared to previous acts, the expansion was far from substantial.  The electorate remained limited and primarily consisted of a small segment of the Indian male population, based on property qualifications and other restrictive criteria.  The Act did not grant voting rights to a large portion of the Indian population;  universal adult suffrage was a distant goal.  The limited expansion of the franchise highlighted the continued limitations on Indian political participation under British rule.  Subsequent acts would gradually broaden the franchise, but the 1919 Act fell short of significant expansion.



**2. With reference to the impact of the British revenue systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, while intending to secure long-term revenue for the British, led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few Zamindars.
2. The Ryotwari System, by directly collecting revenue from individual cultivators, prevented the emergence of powerful intermediaries and ensured equitable distribution of land.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of other regions, aimed to establish a stable and predictable revenue stream for the British East India Company. However, it inadvertently led to the concentration of land ownership among a relatively small number of Zamindars.  These Zamindars, granted proprietary rights over large tracts of land, often exploited the peasantry through high rents and other oppressive practices. This system contributed to the growth of absentee landlordism and further marginalized the rural population.  The unintended consequences of the Permanent Settlement highlight the complexities of British land revenue policies and their significant impact on Indian agrarian society.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ryotwari System, implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, aimed to collect revenue directly from individual cultivators (Ryots). While it did eliminate the Zamindari intermediary, it did not necessarily lead to an equitable distribution of land. In practice, the system often resulted in over-assessment of land revenue, leading to widespread indebtedness and the displacement of many cultivators.  Powerful moneylenders often stepped in to exploit the indebted Ryots, further exacerbating social and economic inequalities.  The Ryotwari system, although different from the Zamindari system, also had its own set of shortcomings and contributed to the impoverishment of the rural population.



**3. With reference to Lord Curzon's tenure as Viceroy of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  He implemented significant administrative reforms, creating the Indian Agricultural Service to improve agricultural practices.
2.  He advocated for greater autonomy for the Princely States, reducing British interference in their internal affairs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Curzon, during his viceroyalty (1899-1905), implemented several administrative reforms aimed at modernizing and streamlining the Indian administration. A significant step was the establishment of the Indian Agricultural Service, which aimed to improve agricultural techniques and productivity in the country.  This initiative was part of a larger effort to enhance the efficiency of the colonial administration and improve the economic condition of India, at least superficially.  However, the broader context of his policies often served the interests of British imperialism.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Lord Curzon's policies regarding the Princely States were characterized by a strengthening, not a reduction, of British control and influence.  He believed in the principle of paramountcy, asserting the supreme authority of the British Crown over the Princely States.  He actively intervened in the internal affairs of several states, aiming to bring them under tighter British control. This policy was in stark contrast to a more autonomous approach to the princely states.  Curzon's actions reinforced British dominance over Indian territories.


**4. With reference to the British policy towards educated Indians, consider the following statements:**

1. Initially, the British actively encouraged modern education in India, believing it would create a loyal and cooperative Indian elite.
2. Following the 1857 revolt and the rise of Indian nationalism, British attitudes shifted, and they became increasingly suspicious of and hostile towards higher education among Indians.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In the early stages of British rule, particularly after the 1833 Charter Act, there was a conscious effort to promote Western-style education in India. This was partly driven by a belief that educating Indians would create a class of loyal, anglicized individuals who would support British rule. The establishment of universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras reflects this initial policy.  However, this approach was not entirely altruistic; it also served to create a class of Indians who could fill administrative roles within the colonial system.


Statement 2 is also correct.  The 1857 revolt was a turning point. The British increasingly viewed educated Indians with suspicion, especially those involved in the nationalist movement.  The rise of Indian nationalism, fueled partly by the educated elite, posed a direct challenge to British authority.  This led to a change in British policy, with a more cautious and often hostile approach towards higher education and the educated classes. The British began to see modern education as a potential threat to their rule rather than a tool for cooperation.  This shift in perspective reflects the evolving dynamics of the colonial relationship.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Indian Factory Acts of the 19th century:**

1. The 1881 Act primarily focused on regulating child labor, setting minimum age limits and restricting working hours for children.
2. The 1891 Act extended regulations to cover women in factories, limiting their working hours but not imposing restrictions on men's working hours.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Factory Act of 1881 was a landmark piece of legislation focusing primarily on the issue of child labor.  It prohibited the employment of children under the age of 7 and placed restrictions on the working hours of children aged 7 to 12.  The Act also mandated certain safety measures and holidays for child laborers. This reflected a growing awareness of the exploitative conditions faced by children in Indian factories, although the enforcement of these regulations was often weak.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The 1891 Act built upon the 1881 Act, extending regulations to include women working in factories.  It set limits on the working hours for women, while notably, it did not regulate the working hours of adult men.  This disparity highlighted the gendered nature of labor laws at the time and the unequal treatment of women workers in the colonial context.  The Act, while a step forward, still left significant gaps in worker protection.  The lack of regulation for men's working hours demonstrates the limitations of the legislation and the continued vulnerability of the working class.

**1. With reference to the Permanent Settlement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, granted proprietary rights to the Zamindars, thereby creating a class of landowners who collected revenue from cultivators.
2.  The Ryotwari system, implemented concurrently with the Permanent Settlement, aimed to collect revenue directly from individual cultivators, eliminating the intermediary role of Zamindars.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key feature of the Permanent Settlement.  Lord Cornwallis, as Governor-General, introduced this system primarily in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of Orissa.  The intention was to establish a stable revenue stream for the British East India Company by granting proprietary rights to Zamindars, who then collected revenue from the cultivators (ryots) and remitted a fixed amount to the Company. This created a powerful landowning class, the Zamindars, whose interests became intertwined with the continued British rule.  The system, however, had significant drawbacks, leading to widespread exploitation of ryots and ultimately hindering agricultural development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ryotwari system was *not* implemented concurrently with the Permanent Settlement.  Instead, it emerged as an alternative land revenue system, primarily in Madras and Bombay Presidencies.  The Ryotwari system aimed to collect revenue directly from the individual cultivators (ryots), bypassing the Zamindars altogether.  This system also had its own set of problems, including over-assessment of land revenue and exploitation of the peasantry.  The two systems were distinct approaches to land revenue management and were implemented in different regions of British India at different times. The key difference lies in the presence or absence of an intermediary (Zamindar) between the British government and the cultivator.



**2. With reference to the impact of British rule on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the Mahalwari system aimed to foster collective village responsibility for revenue collection, preserving traditional village structures.
2.  The Ryotwari system, while intending to establish direct revenue collection from cultivators, often resulted in over-assessment and peasant indebtedness.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but ultimately misleading. The Mahalwari system did attempt to involve village communities in revenue collection, using village headmen (lambardars) as intermediaries. However, the system's implementation often disrupted traditional village structures due to its complex procedures, inaccurate assessments, and high revenue demands.  The aim of preserving traditional structures was often undermined by the practical realities of its execution. The system frequently led to disputes and the weakening of the village community rather than its preservation.

Statement 2 correctly highlights a significant consequence of the Ryotwari system. While designed to collect revenue directly from cultivators,  the system often resulted in over-assessment of land revenue, forcing many peasants into cycles of debt.  The revenue demands were often inflexible and insensitive to variations in crop yields or market prices, leading to widespread economic hardship and impoverishment among the peasantry.  This aspect of the Ryotwari system had a profound and lasting negative impact on the rural economy and social fabric.


**3. With reference to British administrative policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British consistently pursued a policy of promoting Hindu-Muslim unity to maintain stability and prevent widespread unrest.
2.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, enacted by Lord Lytton, aimed to restrict the freedom of the Indian-language press, which was increasingly critical of British rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The British often employed a "divide and rule" policy, exploiting existing religious and caste differences to weaken the nationalist movement.  While there were periods of seeming cooperation with certain religious groups, the overarching strategy was to prevent the formation of a unified national front against British rule.  Promoting Hindu-Muslim unity was not a consistent or primary policy objective.

Statement 2 accurately describes the intent and impact of the Vernacular Press Act of 1878.  Enacted by Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India at the time, this act aimed to curb the growing influence of the Indian-language press, which was becoming increasingly critical of British policies and actions.  The act imposed strict censorship and restrictions on the publication of news and opinions deemed to be seditious or harmful to British interests.  This demonstrates the British government's attempts to control information and suppress dissent. The act's eventual repeal reflects the growing strength of Indian public opinion and the limitations of such repressive measures in the long run.


**4. With reference to the British revenue systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement aimed to increase agricultural productivity by providing Zamindars with long-term security of tenure and incentives for investment in land improvement.
2. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of northern India, involved revenue settlement with individual cultivators rather than village communities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate regarding the outcome of the Permanent Settlement. While the intention was to incentivize Zamindars to improve agricultural productivity by granting them long-term security of tenure,  the reality was quite different.  The high and fixed revenue demands often left Zamindars with little incentive to invest in improvements. Instead, many focused on maximizing rent extraction from the ryots, leading to widespread peasant impoverishment and neglect of land improvement.  The system ultimately failed to achieve its intended goal of increased agricultural productivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of northern India, specifically focused on revenue settlement with village communities or groups of villages (Mahals), not individual cultivators.  Village headmen or a group of village leaders were responsible for collecting revenue from the cultivators within their Mahal and remitting it to the British government. This is the key difference between Mahalwari and Ryotwari systems.  The system aimed at collective responsibility for revenue, though this didn't always protect the interests of individual cultivators.


**5. With reference to early nationalist responses to British rule, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, initially advocated for complete independence from British rule.
2.  Early nationalists utilized the press to criticize British policies and raise national consciousness, leading to restrictions on press freedom through acts like the Vernacular Press Act of 1878.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian National Congress, in its early years, primarily focused on constitutional methods to achieve greater Indian participation in the government.  The demand for complete independence emerged later in the nationalist movement, with the rise of more radical voices and growing disillusionment with constitutional reforms.  The early Congress was characterized by a more moderate approach, advocating for reforms within the existing British framework.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the role of the press in the early nationalist movement and the British response to it. The Indian press, controlled by educated Indians, became a powerful tool for disseminating nationalist ideas and critiquing British policies.  This led the British to enact repressive measures, such as the Vernacular Press Act of 1878, to curb the freedom of the Indian-language press and control the narrative.  This highlights the tension between the growing Indian nationalist movement and the British attempt to maintain control.

**1. With reference to the Permanent Settlement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, granted proprietary rights to Zamindars, establishing a system of fixed land revenue payable to the British East India Company.
2.  While initially intended to foster agricultural improvement, the Permanent Settlement led to the impoverishment of many ryots due to high revenue demands and the rise of absentee landlordism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1793, was a landmark land revenue system in British India.  Its core feature was the grant of proprietary rights to Zamindars, who became responsible for collecting land revenue from the ryots (peasants) and remitting a fixed amount to the Company. This system aimed to establish a stable and predictable revenue stream for the British, replacing the previous fluctuating and often corrupt methods of revenue collection.  The system, while primarily implemented in Bengal, was also extended to other areas like Bihar, Orissa, and parts of Madras.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the intention behind the Permanent Settlement was to encourage Zamindars to invest in agricultural improvements, the reality proved far different. The high revenue demands imposed on the Zamindars often led them to exploit the ryots excessively to meet their obligations. This resulted in widespread impoverishment among the peasantry.  Furthermore, the system facilitated the growth of absentee landlordism, as Zamindaris were frequently sold or mortgaged, leading to a disconnect between landowners and the actual cultivators. This created a system of exploitation where the benefits of agricultural production largely bypassed the ryots, contributing to their economic hardship and social unrest.  The system’s rigid structure and lack of flexibility in the face of fluctuating agricultural yields further exacerbated these issues.


**2. With reference to the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICS was established to ensure efficient administration in British India, with recruitment primarily based on merit through competitive examinations held in London.
2.  While Indians were permitted to take the ICS examinations, systemic biases and the examination's format, conducted in English, effectively limited Indian participation in the service's higher echelons.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Indian Civil Service (ICS) was the backbone of British administration in India. Its establishment aimed to create a professional and efficient bureaucracy to govern the vast and diverse territories under British control.  The introduction of competitive examinations, ostensibly based on merit, was a significant step towards creating a more structured and less patronage-based system of recruitment.  However, the location of these examinations in London and the use of English as the medium of examination already created significant hurdles for Indian participation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Despite the claim of merit-based recruitment, the ICS was deeply biased against Indian participation. The examinations were held exclusively in London, making it financially and logistically challenging for most Indians to compete.  Further, the examination syllabus focused heavily on classical European subjects, such as Greek and Latin, which were not part of the typical Indian educational curriculum. This created an uneven playing field, effectively barring most Indians from accessing the higher echelons of the ICS.  Even those few Indians who managed to qualify faced systemic discrimination and limited opportunities for advancement. The language barrier, the geographical disadvantage, and the inherent racial biases within the colonial system all contributed to the limited representation of Indians in the higher ranks of the ICS.


**3. With reference to the impact of British policies on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ryotwari system, implemented mainly in South India, aimed to collect land revenue directly from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries, and resulted in increased agricultural productivity and prosperity.
2. The Mahalwari system, prevalent in parts of North India, assessed land revenue collectively on a village basis and, while initially facing challenges, eventually contributed to a more equitable distribution of land ownership.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ryotwari system, while aiming to collect land revenue directly from individual cultivators, did not lead to increased agricultural productivity and prosperity.  Instead, it often resulted in overassessment of land revenue, leading to widespread impoverishment among the peasantry.  The system's inflexibility in the face of fluctuating agricultural yields and the lack of support for agricultural improvements further exacerbated the situation. While it bypassed intermediaries, the direct pressure on individual cultivators proved extremely harsh and often led to debt bondage and landlessness.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Mahalwari system, while assessing land revenue collectively on a village basis, did not lead to a more equitable distribution of land ownership.  Similar to the Ryotwari system, it suffered from issues of overassessment and exploitation. The system's complexity and vulnerability to manipulation by officials and powerful village elites often led to unfair distribution of the tax burden and further marginalized weaker sections of the village community.  Though initially facing significant challenges, the system did not ultimately lead to more equitable land ownership.  Instead, it contributed to further land concentration in the hands of wealthier individuals and groups.


**4. With reference to the development of education under British rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of Western education in India was primarily driven by philanthropic motives, aiming to uplift the Indian population through access to modern knowledge and skills.
2. The emphasis on English as the medium of instruction in higher education created a class of Indians who served as intermediaries between the British rulers and the Indian masses, while simultaneously hindering the development of vernacular languages.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While some individuals and groups within the British administration held philanthropic views on education, the primary driving force behind the introduction of Western education in India was not solely philanthropic.  The British government saw the spread of Western education as a tool to serve their administrative and economic interests.  The need for a cheap and readily available pool of educated Indians to fill subordinate positions in the administration and British businesses was a major factor.  Furthermore,  the belief that educated Indians would facilitate the expansion of the British market in India also played a crucial role in shaping educational policy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The emphasis on English as the medium of instruction in higher education did indeed create a class of Indians who acted as intermediaries between the British rulers and the Indian masses.  This elite, educated in English, gained positions in the administration, businesses, and professions, facilitating communication and administration within the colonial system.  However, this emphasis on English also significantly hindered the development of vernacular languages and created a wide gap between the educated elite and the largely illiterate masses. This linguistic divide had long-lasting consequences for Indian society and its cultural development.  The prioritization of English over Indian languages reflects the colonial power dynamic and its impact on the educational landscape.

**1. With reference to the Ryotwari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the Ryotwari system, land revenue was collected directly from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries like Zamindars.
2.  The Ryotwari system, initially implemented in Madras Presidency, was later extended to parts of Bombay and other regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ryotwari system was a significant land revenue system implemented by the British in India.  Statement 1 accurately reflects a core feature of this system: the direct collection of land revenue from individual cultivators (ryots). This contrasted sharply with the Zamindari system, where revenue was collected through intermediaries (Zamindars).  The elimination of intermediaries was intended to increase government revenue and reduce corruption. The direct relationship between the government and the cultivator was a defining characteristic that aimed for greater efficiency in revenue collection.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Ryotwari system originated in the Madras Presidency under the administration of Thomas Munro, its success (or perceived success, as it had its flaws) led to its adoption in other parts of British India, notably parts of the Bombay Presidency and subsequently other areas. The expansion of the Ryotwari system reflects the British attempt to establish a uniform revenue system across their territories, although variations and adaptations existed depending on local conditions.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Ryotwari system.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Charter Act of 1833:**

1.  The Charter Act of 1833 formally ended the East India Company's monopoly over trade in India, except for the tea trade.
2.  The Act established a separate legislative council for the governance of India, independent of the Governor-General's executive council.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A crucial aspect of the Charter Act of 1833 was the dismantling of the East India Company's long-standing trade monopoly in India.  This marked a significant shift towards free trade principles. However,  the Act did retain a limited monopoly for the Company in the tea trade for a transitional period. This exception highlights the complexities and gradual nature of the liberalization process.  The gradual phasing out of the monopoly reflects the evolving economic policies of the British government and the pressures from various stakeholders.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1833 did not create a separate legislative council independent of the Governor-General's executive council.  Instead, it strengthened the Governor-General's authority and centralized administrative control.  The Act did introduce a Law Member to the Governor-General's council to provide legal expertise in law-making, but this did not constitute a separate legislative body.  The legislative functions remained integrated within the existing executive structure. The lack of a separate legislature at this stage indicates the continuing evolution of India's governance structure under British rule.


**3. With reference to the Permanent Settlement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the Permanent Settlement, the Zamindars were granted ownership rights over their lands in perpetuity, with a fixed revenue demand.
2.  The Permanent Settlement system, implemented primarily in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, significantly improved agricultural productivity and peasant welfare.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a central feature of the Permanent Settlement.  Lord Cornwallis, as Governor-General, introduced this system, granting Zamindars proprietary rights over their lands.  This meant that the Zamindars were responsible for collecting revenue from the peasants and remitting a fixed amount to the British government. While the revenue demand was fixed, this did not guarantee the Zamindars' ownership in perpetuity as it was subject to conditions, including timely revenue payment. The fixed revenue demand aimed to provide the British with a stable income stream.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement aimed to establish a stable revenue system, it did not lead to improved agricultural productivity or peasant welfare. In fact, it had several negative consequences. The fixed revenue demand often exceeded the land's actual productive capacity, leading to Zamindari exploitation of peasants and widespread indebtedness among the rural population. The system also led to the growth of absentee landlordism and subinfeudation, weakening the traditional village structure.  The system's failure to benefit peasants and its negative impact on agricultural development are crucial aspects to consider.


**4. With reference to the Mahalwari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mahalwari system, unlike the Ryotwari system, involved revenue assessment at the village community level (mahal) rather than individual cultivator level.
2.  The Mahalwari system, predominantly implemented in the Punjab and North-Western Provinces, ensured equitable distribution of land and prevented widespread peasant indebtedness.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies a key difference between the Mahalwari and Ryotwari systems. The Mahalwari system assessed revenue at the village community level (mahal), which typically comprised several villages.  This contrasted with the Ryotwari system's direct assessment at the individual cultivator level.  The Mahalwari approach attempted to involve the village community in revenue collection and administration. This community-based approach was a significant departure from the individual focus of the Ryotwari system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Despite the community-based nature of revenue assessment, the Mahalwari system did not effectively prevent widespread peasant indebtedness or ensure equitable land distribution.  Like the other land revenue systems, it often involved high revenue demands that strained the resources of the village communities and individual cultivators. This led to increasing indebtedness, similar to the problems seen under the Ryotwari and Zamindari systems. The system's shortcomings in preventing economic hardship among peasants underscore its limitations.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced the principle of dyarchy, dividing subjects into "reserved" and "transferred" categories, with the latter administered by Indian ministers.
2.  The Act significantly expanded the franchise, granting voting rights to a substantial portion of the Indian population.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a key feature of the Government of India Act, 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms.  Dyarchy introduced a dual system of governance in the provinces.  Subjects were divided into "reserved" (controlled by the Governor and his executive council) and "transferred" (administered by Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures). This was a significant step towards greater Indian participation in governance, though it fell short of full responsible government. The introduction of dyarchy represented a compromise between British control and Indian aspirations for self-rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1919 Act did not significantly expand the franchise.  While it did introduce some elements of direct elections, the franchise remained highly restricted, based on property qualifications, tax payments, or educational attainment.  A small percentage of the Indian population had the right to vote. The limited franchise reflects the British reluctance to grant extensive political rights to the Indian population at this stage.  The restricted nature of the franchise contrasts sharply with later demands for universal adult suffrage.


**6.  With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a bicameral legislature at the federal level, comprising the Council of States and the Federal Legislative Assembly.
2. The Act completely abolished communal electorates, replacing them with a system of joint electorates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key feature of the Government of India Act, 1935, was the establishment of a federal structure with a bicameral legislature.  This comprised the Council of States (Upper House) and the Federal Legislative Assembly (Lower House).  This bicameral system aimed to balance the representation of different interests and regions within the proposed federation. The creation of a bicameral legislature reflected the increasing complexity of Indian governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1935 Act did not abolish communal electorates.  In fact, it extended the system of separate electorates to various communities, including Muslims, Sikhs, and depressed classes. This provision, intended to address concerns of minority representation, ultimately contributed to the deepening of communal divisions and ultimately the partition of India. The retention of communal electorates highlights the failure of the Act to fully address the issue of communal harmony.


**7. With reference to the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICS was initially exclusively composed of British personnel, with Indians systematically excluded from higher-level positions.
2. The ICS entrance examination was held exclusively in India, with the intention of promoting Indian participation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the reality of the Indian Civil Service under British rule.  For a significant period, the ICS was dominated by British personnel.  Indians were largely excluded from higher-level positions, reflecting the British policy of maintaining control over the administration.  This exclusion was based on a combination of racial prejudice, a belief in British administrative superiority, and a desire to preserve lucrative positions for British nationals. The exclusive nature of the ICS highlights the unequal power dynamics of the colonial era.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ICS entrance examination was initially held in England, not India.  This posed a significant barrier to Indian participation as it required candidates to travel to England, meet the age restrictions, and compete in an examination conducted in English, based on a Western educational system.  The examination's location in England reinforced the unequal access to higher administrative positions.  Only gradually, under pressure from Indian nationalists, were reforms introduced to allow for simultaneous examinations in India.


**8.  With reference to the British Revenue Policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, while aiming for revenue stability, led to the impoverishment of many ryots due to high revenue demands and Zamindari exploitation.
2. The Ryotwari system, by directly collecting revenue from individual cultivators, completely eliminated the problem of peasant indebtedness.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly highlights a major consequence of the Permanent Settlement. While the system sought to create a stable and predictable revenue stream for the British, it often resulted in excessive revenue demands placed on the ryots (peasants). This, coupled with the exploitative practices of many Zamindars, led to widespread rural poverty and indebtedness. The unintended consequences of the Permanent Settlement demonstrate the limitations of a revenue system that prioritized government income over peasant welfare.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ryotwari system aimed to improve revenue collection by eliminating intermediaries, it did not eliminate peasant indebtedness.  High revenue demands, coupled with factors like fluctuating agricultural yields and the vulnerability of ryots to moneylenders, continued to contribute to widespread indebtedness.  The Ryotwari system, despite its direct collection method, failed to address the underlying economic vulnerabilities of the peasantry.  The persistence of indebtedness underscores the complex economic challenges faced by rural communities.

**1. With reference to the Charter Act of 1793, consider the following statements:**

1.  It extended the East India Company's trade monopoly indefinitely, solidifying its control over Indian commerce.
2.  It mandated that the salaries of all Company officials, regardless of rank, be paid directly from the British Exchequer.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1793 did *not* extend the East India Company's trade monopoly indefinitely.  Instead, it renewed the Company's charter for a further 20 years. This highlights a crucial difference: the Act acknowledged a time limit, demonstrating a degree of parliamentary oversight and a potential for future renegotiation, rather than absolute, perpetual control.  The act's limited extension contrasts with the idea of an indefinite monopoly, demonstrating a more nuanced approach to the Company's commercial privileges than a simple, permanent grant.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1793 did *not* mandate that all Company officials' salaries be paid directly from the British Exchequer.  While the Act did address financial matters, it stipulated that the Company was to remit 5 lakh pounds annually to the British government after covering its expenses, including salaries. This indicates that the Company, not the British Exchequer, was primarily responsible for its own financial administration and the compensation of its employees. The distinction between Company funds and direct Exchequer payment is crucial for understanding the financial relationship between the Company and the British government at the time.


**2. With reference to the role of Lord Cornwallis in British India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Cornwallis's Permanent Settlement aimed to establish a system of land revenue collection that directly benefited the peasantry by reducing their tax burden.
2.  The Treaty of Seringapatam, negotiated by Lord Cornwallis, resulted in the complete annexation of Mysore into British territory.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lord Cornwallis's Permanent Settlement aimed to create a stable revenue system, it did *not* directly benefit the peasantry.  The system granted ownership rights to Zamindars, who were often exploitative, leading to increased burdens on the peasantry in many cases.  The intent was to create predictable revenue streams for the British, not necessarily to alleviate the tax burdens on cultivators. The long-term consequences of the Permanent Settlement, including the creation of a powerful Zamindari class and its impact on agricultural productivity, are significant historical factors that contradict the notion of direct peasant benefit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Treaty of Seringapatam, negotiated by Lord Cornwallis in 1792, did *not* result in the complete annexation of Mysore.  While the treaty significantly weakened Tipu Sultan's power and imposed harsh conditions on Mysore, it did not lead to immediate annexation.  Mysore retained its sovereignty, albeit under considerable British influence and control. The treaty’s terms, including the significant territorial losses and the payment of hefty indemnities, illustrate the extent of British dominance, but the survival of Mysore as a separate entity refutes the claim of complete annexation.


**3. With reference to the Charter Act of 1813, consider the following statements:**

1. The act completely abolished the East India Company's monopoly over all trade within India, promoting free market principles.
2. A significant portion of the revenue generated from India was allocated to fund educational initiatives for Indians.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Charter Act of 1813 did *not* completely abolish the East India Company's trade monopoly. While it did open up trade in India to British subjects outside the Company, the Company retained its monopoly over the lucrative tea trade and trade with China. This demonstrates a compromise between the desire for free trade and the continued strategic importance of the Company's control over specific sectors. The partial liberalization of trade reflects the complex interplay of economic and political considerations in shaping the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The Charter Act of 1813 did allocate a sum of one lakh rupees annually for the "revival, promotion, and encouragement of literature, learning, and science among the natives of India". This marked a significant step towards acknowledging the importance of education in India, although the actual implementation and impact of this provision were subject to various factors. The allocation, however small in the context of the Company's overall revenue, represents a formal commitment to educational development within the colonial framework.


**4. With reference to the impact of the Charter Act of 1833, consider the following statements:**

1. The act formally transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British Crown, ending Company rule.
2. It introduced a system of competitive examinations for recruitment to the Indian Civil Service, ensuring equal opportunity for Indians and Europeans.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1833 did *not* immediately transfer the governance of India to the British Crown. While it laid the groundwork for this transition by stating that India's territories were to be governed in the name of the Crown, the actual transfer of power happened only with the Government of India Act 1858 after the Sepoy Mutiny. The Act of 1833 represents a crucial step towards the eventual end of Company rule, but it did not immediately bring about that change.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1833 did *not* introduce a system of competitive examinations for recruitment to the Indian Civil Service.  It did theoretically open up the ICS to Indians, regardless of religion, colour, birth, etc. However, the practical implementation of this provision was slow and ineffective.  The competitive examination system was introduced later, with the Charter Act of 1853.  The Act of 1833's declaration of equal opportunity, however, was a significant symbolic step in the evolution of the ICS, even if its immediate impact was limited.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Government of India Act, 1919:**

1. It introduced the principle of diarchy, dividing powers between elected Indian ministers and British officials in the provinces.
2. It established a completely independent Indian legislature with full control over all financial matters.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1919, famously introduced diarchy in the provinces.  This system divided subjects into "reserved" (under British control) and "transferred" (under Indian ministers) categories.  This was a significant step towards limited self-government, though it fell short of full responsible government. The implementation of diarchy and its eventual shortcomings are important aspects of Indian constitutional history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1919, did *not* establish a completely independent Indian legislature with full financial control. While it expanded the legislature's powers compared to previous acts, significant financial and legislative powers remained vested in the British Governor-General and the British government. The limitations on the legislature's financial control highlight the continuing dominance of British authority within the Indian political system.  The Act's concessions to Indian participation were significant, but the ultimate power remained with the British.


**6. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  It established a fully autonomous all-India federation with complete dominion status for India.
2. It abolished diarchy in the provinces and introduced provincial autonomy.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1935, did *not* establish a fully autonomous all-India federation with complete dominion status. Although it envisioned an all-India federation, it failed to materialize due to the non-participation of many princely states and opposition from Indian political parties. Moreover, the federation was not granted dominion status. The Act's provisions for a federation, its eventual failure to fully materialize, and the reasons for this failure are critical for a thorough understanding of the political climate leading up to Indian independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, did abolish diarchy in the provinces and introduced provincial autonomy. This marked a significant step towards greater self-governance, granting provinces greater control over their internal affairs. The abolition of diarchy and the introduction of provincial autonomy represent a major shift in the constitutional framework, allowing for greater Indian participation in provincial administration.


**7. With reference to the role of the Indian National Congress in the development of local self-government in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress consistently advocated for the complete abolition of local bodies, viewing them as instruments of colonial control.
2.  The Congress actively participated in local bodies, using them as platforms to promote nationalist ideals and mobilize public support.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian National Congress did *not* consistently advocate for the complete abolition of local bodies. While the Congress was critical of the limitations of local bodies under colonial rule, it recognized their potential as platforms for political mobilization and social reform.  The Congress's approach involved working within the existing system to gain experience and influence, rather than outright rejection.  The Congress's strategic engagement with local bodies is a significant aspect of its broader political strategy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian National Congress *did* actively participate in local bodies, using them as platforms to promote nationalist ideals and mobilize public support.  Congress members contested elections, advocated for reforms, and used local governance as a means to connect with the masses and build a grassroots political base. The Congress's engagement with local bodies is crucial in understanding its broader strategy for achieving independence.  The use of local bodies as a means of reaching out to the people and advancing nationalist sentiment is a significant aspect of its history.

**1. With reference to early Indian nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Amrita Bazar Patrika, initially a Bengali-language newspaper, played a significant role in disseminating nationalist ideas and critiquing British policies, later shifting to English to circumvent press restrictions.
2.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, while ostensibly aimed at curbing seditious content, disproportionately affected vernacular newspapers, hindering the spread of nationalist sentiment amongst the masses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Amrita Bazar Patrika, founded by Sisir Kumar Ghosh and Motilal Ghosh, was indeed a powerful voice in the early nationalist movement. Initially published in Bengali, its shift to English demonstrates a strategic response to the British government's attempts to control the vernacular press through legislation like the Vernacular Press Act of 1878.  The newspaper's critical stance on British policies and its role in shaping public opinion are well-documented aspects of its history. The newspaper's influence extended beyond its immediate readership, contributing to the broader national awakening.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 was a blatant attempt by the British to suppress dissent and control the narrative. By targeting vernacular newspapers, the British aimed to limit the reach of nationalist ideas among the wider Indian population, who primarily consumed news in their regional languages. The Act's discriminatory nature and its impact on the freedom of the press are significant aspects of the colonial period.  While the stated intention was to curb sedition, the Act's application was often arbitrary and politically motivated, highlighting the colonial government's authoritarian tendencies.  The Act's impact on the dissemination of nationalist ideals is a crucial factor in understanding the dynamics of the freedom struggle.


**2. With reference to the Indian nationalist press, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's newspapers, *Kesari* (Marathi) and *Mahratta* (English), were instrumental in mobilizing support for the Swadeshi movement and fostering a sense of Indian nationalism, even facing government repression for their outspoken criticism.
2.  The *Bengalee*, edited by Surendranath Banerjea, primarily focused on advocating for moderate constitutional reforms within the existing British framework, avoiding direct confrontation with the colonial government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Tilak's *Kesari* and *Mahratta* were powerful voices in the nationalist movement, actively promoting Swadeshi, and advocating for a more assertive approach towards British rule.  Tilak's writings frequently criticized British policies and directly challenged the colonial authority.  This led to several arrests and prosecutions under sedition laws, solidifying his image as a strong nationalist leader and highlighting the crucial role of the press in the freedom struggle.  His newspapers played a key role in mobilizing public opinion and extending the reach of nationalist ideas beyond the urban elite.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the *Bengalee* under Surendranath Banerjea was a significant nationalist newspaper, it is inaccurate to characterize its approach as solely focused on moderate constitutional reforms and avoidance of direct confrontation.  While Banerjea was a prominent moderate leader, the *Bengalee* engaged in sharp criticism of British policies, albeit often within a framework that advocated for constitutional means of redress.  It did not shy away from expressing strong nationalist sentiment and played a vital role in shaping public discourse and opinion.  The newspaper's contributions to the nationalist movement were multifaceted and cannot be reduced to a simplistic characterization of solely moderate constitutionalism.


**3. With reference to the impact of British policies on the Indian press, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Metcalfe Act of 1835, while initially promoting press freedom by removing pre-censorship, laid the groundwork for future restrictions by requiring registration and allowing for the suppression of publications deemed to incite violence.
2.  The repressive measures imposed on the Indian press during the First World War, including the Defense of India Rules, significantly curtailed freedom of expression and hampered the dissemination of nationalist views, effectively silencing opposition.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Metcalfe Act of 1835, though lauded for removing pre-censorship, contained provisions that allowed for future restrictions. The requirement for registration provided a mechanism for the government to monitor and control publications.  Moreover, the Act did not offer complete protection against suppression.  The government retained the power to act against publications deemed to incite violence or disrupt public order. This seemingly liberal measure laid the foundation for later, more restrictive press laws, showcasing the British government's ability to manipulate legal frameworks to serve its colonial interests.

Statement 2 is also correct. The First World War saw a dramatic escalation in the British government's repression of the Indian press. The Defense of India Rules, implemented under the pretext of national security, provided sweeping powers to censor and suppress any publication deemed critical of the war effort or the government.  This effectively silenced many nationalist voices and significantly hampered the dissemination of dissenting opinions. The restrictions imposed during this period highlight the extent to which the colonial government was willing to curtail fundamental freedoms to maintain its control.  The wartime restrictions underscore the fragility of press freedom even during periods of apparent liberalization.

**1. With reference to the Dutch East India Company's activities in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dutch initially established a significant trading presence in Gujarat before expanding to other regions.
2.  The Dutch primarily focused on the spice trade in the East Indies, with their Indian operations being a secondary concern.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) did indeed establish a strong foothold in Gujarat, particularly in Surat, as one of their earliest and most important trading centers in India.  This served as a crucial base for their expansion into other parts of the subcontinent.  Their engagement in Gujarat demonstrates a significant early investment in Indian trade, before their activities broadened.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the VOC was undeniably involved in Indian trade, their primary focus and vast majority of resources were dedicated to the lucrative spice trade in the East Indies (present-day Indonesia). The Indian trade, while profitable, was considered a secondary but still important aspect of their overall colonial enterprise.  The vast majority of their investments, ships, and manpower were directed towards controlling the spice trade in the Indonesian archipelago.  This strategic prioritization is a key element of understanding the VOC's operations.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Industrial Revolution on India, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of railways in India during the first half of the 19th century primarily served to facilitate the export of raw materials to Britain and the import of British manufactured goods, rather than promoting Indian industrial development.
2.  The Indian handicraft industry experienced a significant decline due to competition from cheaper British machine-made goods, but this decline was not solely caused by British policy; internal factors like loss of patronage from Indian elites also contributed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The construction of railways in India during the British Raj was strategically driven by the needs of the British economy.  The railway network significantly reduced transportation costs and time, making it far easier and cheaper to export raw materials from India (like cotton, jute, and opium) to British factories and import finished goods back to India.  This infrastructure primarily served to strengthen Britain's colonial economic exploitation of India, rather than fostering indigenous industrial growth.  The focus was on facilitating a one-way flow of goods benefiting British industries.

Statement 2 is also correct. The decline of the Indian handicraft industry was a complex process with multiple contributing factors. While the influx of cheaper British manufactured goods, facilitated by the aforementioned railway system and free trade policies, played a major role in the decline, it's crucial to recognize that internal factors also significantly contributed. The changing tastes of Indian elites, who increasingly favored British goods, and the loss of traditional patronage from princely courts led to a decrease in demand for Indian handicrafts, further exacerbating the impact of British competition.  Thus, the decline was a result of both external and internal pressures.


**3. With reference to the economic policies of the British East India Company in the 18th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The Company's "Investments" system, whereby the Company purchased Indian goods using revenue from Bengal, led to a significant outflow of wealth from India to Britain.
2.  While the Company's policies led to the deindustrialization of some sectors of the Indian economy, it also stimulated the growth of certain export-oriented cash crops, such as indigo and opium, which generated significant revenue for the Company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The East India Company's "Investments" system was a key mechanism for the drain of wealth from India.  The Company used the revenue it collected (often through exploitative means) from territories like Bengal to purchase Indian goods at low prices and export them to Britain, generating massive profits for the Company and contributing significantly to the economic drain. This system effectively siphoned wealth from the Indian economy without providing commensurate economic benefits.

Statement 2 is also correct. Although the Company's policies ultimately led to the decline of many traditional Indian industries, it simultaneously fostered the growth of certain cash crops geared towards export.  Indigo and opium were two prominent examples.  The Company actively encouraged the cultivation of these crops to meet the demand in European and Chinese markets respectively. This generated significant revenue for the Company, but often at the expense of Indian farmers who were subjected to exploitative contracts and low prices.  The growth of these cash crops, while economically beneficial for the Company, further contributed to the unbalanced and exploitative nature of the Indian economy under colonial rule.


**4. With reference to the effects of British rule on Indian agriculture in the 19th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the Permanent Settlement system, while intended to secure land revenue for the British, led to the impoverishment of many peasants due to high tax demands and the rise of powerful intermediaries.
2.  The commercialization of Indian agriculture, driven by British demand for raw materials, resulted in a shift towards cash crops, often at the expense of food crop production, increasing vulnerability to famines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Permanent Settlement system, implemented in Bengal and other regions, aimed to establish a stable revenue stream for the British. However, the system had unintended consequences that severely impacted Indian peasants.  The high tax demands placed on the zamindars often led them to extract excessive rents from the peasants, pushing many into poverty and indebtedness. Furthermore, the system created a class of powerful intermediaries (zamindars) who often exploited their tenants, further exacerbating the situation. The system's rigidity and lack of consideration for the realities of agricultural production made it particularly harmful during periods of poor harvests.

Statement 2 is also correct. The British demand for raw materials to fuel their burgeoning industries led to the commercialization of Indian agriculture. This resulted in a significant shift towards cash crops like cotton, jute, and indigo, which were in high demand in Britain.  However, this shift often came at the expense of food crop production, making India more vulnerable to famines.  The focus on cash crops for export, rather than food security, exacerbated the impact of droughts and other natural calamities, leading to widespread suffering and death.  This commercialization, while profitable for British industries, significantly undermined the resilience of the Indian agricultural system.


**5. With reference to the decline of Indian industries under British rule, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian shipbuilding industry suffered a significant decline due to discriminatory British policies that favored British-built ships and imposed restrictions on Indian vessels trading with other countries.
2.  While the textile industry faced severe competition from British machine-made goods, other traditional Indian industries, such as those producing steel and other metal goods, remained largely unaffected by British economic policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The British systematically dismantled the Indian shipbuilding industry through a series of discriminatory policies.  Laws were passed that effectively barred Indian-built ships from participating in lucrative trade routes with Britain and other countries, giving British ships a monopoly. This, combined with the imposition of heavy duties on Indian-built vessels, severely hampered the industry's ability to compete and ultimately led to its decline.  Ports like Surat, Bengal, and Masulipatnam, once centers of shipbuilding, suffered greatly.  This was a deliberate policy to enhance British economic dominance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The impact of British rule extended far beyond the textile industry.  While the textile industry was undoubtedly devastated by competition from British mills, other traditional Indian industries also faced significant challenges.  The Indian steel industry, for example, was actively suppressed by British policies designed to maintain British steel's dominance in the market.  Restrictions on the production and import of Indian steel hampered its growth and prevented it from developing into a significant competitor to British steel manufacturers.  The British often used various methods to limit the growth of Indian industries, preventing them from becoming self-sufficient and independent.  The suppression was not limited to textiles.


**6. With reference to the "Drain of Wealth" theory, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Drain of Wealth" theory, primarily articulated by Dadabhai Naoroji, argued that a significant portion of India's wealth was transferred to Britain without any adequate economic return for India.
2. The drain encompassed only direct financial transfers, such as salaries of British officials, and did not include the indirect economic consequences of British policies on Indian trade and industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory was a cornerstone of the nationalist critique of British rule.  It argued that a substantial portion of India's national product was transferred to Britain through various mechanisms, including the salaries and pensions of British officials, profits from British investments in India, and the unequal terms of trade that favored British goods. The theory highlighted the systematic extraction of wealth from India to fuel Britain's economic growth, leaving India impoverished.  This was a powerful argument used to expose the exploitative nature of British colonialism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The "Drain of Wealth" theory was far more comprehensive than simply direct financial transfers.  While it certainly included direct transfers like the salaries of British officials, it also encompassed the broader and often more significant indirect economic consequences of British policies.  The destruction of Indian industries, the manipulation of trade to favor British goods, and the systematic underdevelopment of the Indian economy all contributed to the "drain," representing a loss of potential wealth and economic growth for India. The theory considered the entire spectrum of economic exploitation, not just direct financial outflows.  The indirect costs were arguably even more damaging in the long term.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the economic impact of British rule on India:**

1.  The British emphasis on commercialization of agriculture led to increased food production and improved food security for the Indian population.
2. The growth of modern industries in India during the British period was largely limited to export-oriented sectors and did not significantly contribute to overall industrialization or employment generation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British did commercialize Indian agriculture, leading to a shift toward cash crops, this did not result in increased food production or improved food security.  In fact, the opposite often occurred.  The focus on cash crops for export at the expense of food crops made India more vulnerable to famines, resulting in widespread starvation and death during periods of drought or crop failure.  The commercialization prioritized British economic interests over the needs of the Indian population.  Food security was severely compromised.

Statement 2 is correct. The industrial development that did occur in India under British rule was largely concentrated in export-oriented sectors, such as cotton textiles and jute.  These industries primarily served British interests, supplying raw materials and finished goods for the British market.  The overall contribution to industrialization and employment generation within India was limited, failing to offset the devastating impact of deindustrialization in other sectors. The industrial growth was unbalanced and did not lead to broad-based economic development.  The benefits were largely confined to a small number of people and did not address the widespread poverty and unemployment.

**1. With reference to the economic policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar implemented the *dahsala* system, a land revenue system based on a ten-year average crop yield, aiming for a fairer assessment than previous methods.
2.  Akbar's revenue reforms included the *zabt* system, a detailed land survey and assessment system that aimed to directly assess the land's productivity and tax potential.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's economic policies.  Statement 1 correctly describes the *dahsala* system, a significant land revenue reform aimed at improving the accuracy and fairness of tax collection by averaging crop yields over a decade.  This mitigated the impact of annual fluctuations and reduced the potential for exploitation of farmers.  Statement 2 is also correct in its description of the *zabt* system, a more sophisticated approach involving detailed land surveys and assessments to determine the land's potential productivity, directly linking taxation to actual yield.  While the *zabt* system was more precise, it wasn't universally implemented due to logistical challenges, but its introduction demonstrated Akbar's commitment to a more efficient and equitable revenue system.  The other options are incorrect because both systems were indeed part of Akbar's broader land revenue reforms, reflecting his efforts to consolidate and strengthen the Mughal empire through a more stable and productive economy.  The success of these reforms contributed significantly to the empire's economic prosperity during his reign.


**2. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The weakening of the Mughal Empire was primarily caused by Aurangzeb's religious intolerance, which alienated the Rajput and other non-Muslim populations, leading to widespread rebellions.
2.  The economic crisis within the Mughal Empire, manifested in the *bejagiri* crisis (shortage of jagirs), coupled with inefficient administration and internal conflicts among nobles, significantly contributed to its downfall.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements identify key factors contributing to the decline of the Mughal Empire. Statement 1 correctly points to Aurangzeb's religiously intolerant policies as a major catalyst. His reimposition of the *jizya* tax and his generally harsh treatment of non-Muslim subjects significantly alienated important segments of the population, including the Rajputs, who had previously been staunch allies. This weakened the empire's internal cohesion and fueled various rebellions that further destabilized the state.  However, it's crucial to note that Aurangzeb's policies weren't the sole cause. Statement 2 correctly highlights the significant role of economic and administrative factors. The *bejagiri* crisis, a severe shortage of jagirs (land grants to nobles), exacerbated internal conflicts and weakened the loyalty of the nobility, who were crucial to the empire's administration and military strength.  Coupled with general administrative inefficiency and corruption, this economic crisis severely hampered the empire's ability to function effectively.  Therefore, the decline of the Mughal Empire was a complex process stemming from both internal conflicts fueled by Aurangzeb's policies and deeper economic and administrative issues.  Attributing the decline solely to one factor overlooks the multifaceted nature of this historical event.


**3. With reference to the activities of the English East India Company in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The English East India Company initially established its presence in India primarily through peaceful trade negotiations with Mughal emperors, securing permission to establish factories in major port cities like Surat.
2.  The English East India Company's acquisition of the zamindari of three villages – Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur – laid the foundation for the city of Calcutta, marking a shift from purely commercial activities to territorial control.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect stages in the English East India Company's expansion in India. Statement 1 correctly describes the company's initial approach.  They began by seeking trading privileges through diplomacy and negotiations with Mughal emperors, securing the right to establish factories in key commercial centers, such as Surat. This initial phase highlights the company's focus on establishing a commercial foothold within the existing political structure of the Mughal Empire.  However, this peaceful coexistence was not to last. Statement 2 correctly points to a pivotal moment in the company's transition from a trading entity to a territorial power. The acquisition of the zamindari rights over Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur marked a significant shift, laying the groundwork for the development of Calcutta into a major city and a center of British power in Bengal.  This acquisition demonstrated the company's growing ambition and its willingness to acquire territorial control, signaling a departure from its purely commercial origins and the beginning of its involvement in Indian politics.  The acquisition of territorial rights provided a strategic base for further expansion and consolidation of power.  Therefore, the company’s history in India involved both diplomatic negotiation and the gradual acquisition of territorial control.


**4. With reference to the reign of Jahangir, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jahangir, despite inheriting a vast empire from Akbar, significantly expanded Mughal territorial control across India, particularly in the Deccan region, consolidating his power.
2.  Jahangir's reign witnessed a notable flourishing of Mughal painting, characterized by a greater emphasis on realism and naturalism in portraiture, especially under the patronage of artists like Ustad Mansur.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jahangir inherited a vast empire, his reign was not marked by significant territorial expansion. Unlike his father Akbar, Jahangir's focus was primarily on consolidating existing territories rather than aggressive expansion. He did engage in military campaigns, but these were largely aimed at suppressing rebellions and maintaining control within existing boundaries.  The Deccan remained a region of ongoing conflict but did not witness significant expansion under his rule.  Statement 2 is accurate. Jahangir's reign is widely recognized as a high point in Mughal painting.  His patronage of artists, particularly Ustad Mansur, led to a significant development in the style, with a notable shift towards greater realism and naturalism in portraiture.  The detailed and lifelike depiction of flora and fauna in Mughal paintings during Jahangir's era is particularly noteworthy. This artistic flourishing reflects a broader cultural and intellectual climate during his reign.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a prominent aspect of Jahangir’s reign.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Battle of Plassey:**

1.  The Battle of Plassey decisively established British supremacy in Bengal, paving the way for the eventual expansion of British power across India.  The outcome was primarily due to the superior military tactics and technology of the British East India Company.
2.  The Battle of Plassey's outcome was significantly influenced by the treachery of Mir Jafar, the Mir Bakshi (commander-in-chief) of Siraj ud-Daulah's army, who switched allegiance to the British, undermining the Nawab's forces.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate and highlight crucial aspects of the Battle of Plassey. Statement 1 is correct in asserting the battle's significance in establishing British dominance in Bengal.  The victory at Plassey marked a turning point in the British East India Company's expansion, giving them control over a wealthy and strategically important province. While British military technology and training played a role, it's crucial to note that the victory wasn't solely due to these factors.  The numerical superiority of the Nawab's army was substantial.  Statement 2 correctly points to the crucial role of Mir Jafar's betrayal.  His defection, along with that of other commanders, significantly weakened Siraj ud-Daulah's forces, effectively deciding the battle's outcome before any significant fighting occurred.  Mir Jafar's treachery was a decisive factor that cannot be ignored when analyzing the events of Plassey. The battle's outcome was a combination of military factors and political intrigue. Therefore, the combined impact of superior military strategy and the crucial role of internal treachery fully explains the victory of the British at Plassey.


**6. With reference to the introduction of crops in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tobacco cultivation was introduced into India by the Portuguese in the 16th century, and later, the English East India Company also levied taxes on its production.
2. The cultivation of red chillies was introduced into India by the English East India Company during the 18th century, becoming a staple crop in many regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Tobacco was introduced to India by the Portuguese during the 16th century, and its cultivation rapidly spread. The English East India Company, having established itself in India, later did levy taxes on tobacco cultivation and trade. This illustrates the economic aspects of colonial rule, where the colonial power exploited the existing agricultural practices for its own benefit.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While red chillies were widely cultivated in India during the 18th century, there's no evidence to suggest that their introduction was directly attributable to the English East India Company.  Chillies had been present in India for a considerable period before the 18th century, and their cultivation was already widespread across various regions.  The English East India Company may have traded in chillies, but it didn't introduce the crop itself.  Therefore, only Statement 1 provides a correct and historically accurate account, showcasing the Portuguese's early influence and the English East India Company's subsequent economic exploitation of the crop.


**7. With reference to the Mughal Emperors after Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bahadur Shah I, Aurangzeb's successor, pursued a policy of reconciliation with the Marathas and Rajputs, aiming to stabilize the empire after the tumultuous reign of his father.
2.  Muhammad Shah's reign, though relatively long, was characterized by administrative weakness and internal strife, leading to the rise of independent regional powers like Hyderabad and Bengal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the characteristics of the Mughal emperors who succeeded Aurangzeb. Statement 1 correctly describes the initial approach of Bahadur Shah I.  Recognizing the internal weakness and instability that had plagued the empire during Aurangzeb's later years, Bahadur Shah attempted to consolidate power by following a policy of reconciliation with powerful regional groups like the Marathas and Rajputs. This was a strategic move to address the internal fragmentation, but its success was limited given the deeper issues plaguing the empire. Statement 2 is also correct. Muhammad Shah's reign, while lengthy, was marked by significant weakness in governance and recurring internal conflicts among the nobility. This internal strife created opportunities for ambitious regional governors to assert their independence, leading to the emergence of powerful autonomous states like Hyderabad (under Nizam-ul-Mulk) and Bengal (under Murshid Quli Khan).  The rise of these independent states represented a crucial step in the further weakening and eventual disintegration of the Mughal Empire.   Therefore, both statements correctly capture significant aspects of the post-Aurangzeb Mughal period, highlighting the contrasting strategies of its rulers and the overall decline of imperial authority.


**8. With reference to the early British presence in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The English East India Company's initial factories in Bengal were established in peaceful circumstances, securing permission from the Mughal authorities to operate freely without any significant conflict.
2.  The English East India Company's acquisition of Calcutta was achieved through the purchase of the zamindari rights of three villages, demonstrating a gradual expansion of territorial control.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely incorrect. While the East India Company initially sought and obtained permission to establish factories in various locations in Bengal, this process wasn't entirely peaceful.  The relationship between the Company and the Mughal authorities was often fraught with tension, marked by instances of conflict and negotiation.  The Company's actions frequently challenged the authority of local rulers, leading to confrontations and periods of hostility.  The early years of the Company's presence in Bengal were characterized by a complex interplay of cooperation and conflict. Statement 2 is correct. The Company's acquisition of Calcutta was indeed a gradual process involving the purchase of the zamindari rights of three villages—Sutanati, Kalikata, and Govindpur.  This acquisition, initially seemingly small, provided the foundation for the growth of Calcutta into a major city and served as a crucial strategic base for the Company's future expansion in Bengal. It demonstrates how the Company strategically acquired territorial control under the guise of commercial activities.  Therefore, only Statement 2 provides an accurate account of the Company's early expansion in Bengal, showcasing its strategic approach to consolidating power.


**9.  With reference to the French presence in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The French East India Company, initially focused on establishing a strong commercial presence, later engaged in significant territorial ambitions, vying for control of key regions with the British.
2.  The French presence in India was significantly weakened by their defeat in the Battle of Wandiwash during the Third Carnatic War, leading to a decline in their influence and territorial holdings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the French experience in India. Statement 1 correctly captures the dual nature of French involvement.  Initially, the French East India Company focused on building a robust trading network, but their ambitions quickly expanded beyond mere commerce.  Driven by the desire for greater political influence, they engaged in territorial expansion, competing directly with the British for control of key regions and strategically important locations.  This competition led to a series of conflicts known as the Carnatic Wars.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Battle of Wandiwash, fought in 1760 during the Third Carnatic War, was a decisive defeat for the French. This loss severely weakened their military position and significantly diminished their territorial control in India.  The battle marked a turning point in the Anglo-French rivalry in India, ultimately leading to a decline in French influence and paving the way for greater British dominance.  Thus, both statements offer a nuanced understanding of the French's complex engagement with India, encompassing both commercial and territorial pursuits and culminating in a decisive military defeat that significantly curtailed their power.


**10. With reference to the Maratha Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Maratha Empire, initially focused on consolidating their power in Maharashtra, gradually expanded their influence across much of India, even challenging the Mughal Empire for supremacy.
2. The Third Battle of Panipat (1761) significantly weakened the Maratha Empire's power and ambitions, halting their territorial expansion and paving the way for the rise of other regional powers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe phases in the history of the Maratha Empire. Statement 1 is correct; the Marathas, starting from their base in Maharashtra, gradually expanded their influence through military campaigns and skillful diplomacy. They challenged the weakened Mughal Empire, establishing their dominance in several regions of India.  Their expansion was a major factor in the decline of the Mughal Empire, highlighting their growing power and ambition.  However, this expansion was not to continue unchecked. Statement 2 is also correct; the Third Battle of Panipat represented a turning point in Maratha history.  The devastating defeat at the hands of Ahmad Shah Abdali significantly weakened their military power and political influence.  This setback halted their territorial expansion and created internal divisions within the Maratha polity, opening the way for the rise of other regional powers and, ultimately, creating opportunities for the British to expand their influence in India.  The battle's impact on the Maratha Empire's trajectory was profound.  Therefore, both statements correctly illustrate the rise and subsequent decline of Maratha power, highlighting their significant impact on the political landscape of 18th-century India.

**1. With reference to the early European presence in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Portuguese established their first factory in Surat before establishing a presence in Goa.
2.  The French East India Company's earliest factory in India was established in Qasim Bazar.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Portuguese did indeed establish a significant presence in Surat, their earliest factory and major foothold in India was Goa, which they captured in 1510.  Surat became a crucial trading center later, but it was not their initial point of entry. The Portuguese prioritized Goa due to its strategic location and harbor, making it a more suitable base for their expanding operations in the Indian Ocean. The assertion that Surat preceded Goa in their establishment of factories misrepresents the historical sequence of their Indian colonization.

Statement 2 is correct.  The French East India Company's earliest significant factory in India was indeed established in Qasim Bazar. This location was strategically important for its access to trade routes and the Bengal region's lucrative commerce, particularly in textiles and other goods. While the French had other trading posts and settlements, Qasim Bazar holds the distinction of being their earliest major factory. This showcases the French strategic approach to establishing their colonial presence through careful selection of key trading hubs.


**2. With reference to the establishment of European trading posts in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The English East India Company's first factory in South India was established in Masulipatnam after their initial ventures in Orissa.
2.  The Dutch established their first factory in Pulicat before expanding to other locations along the Coromandel Coast.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The English East India Company's initial forays into India were indeed in Orissa (1633), but their first significant factory in South India was subsequently established in Masulipatnam. This reflects the Company's gradual expansion strategy, initially exploring different regions before consolidating its presence in key areas. Masulipatnam's strategic location on the Coromandel Coast made it a vital trading post for textiles and other valuable commodities.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Dutch did establish their earliest major factory in Pulicat.  This location, on the Coromandel Coast, served as a crucial base for their expansion into other parts of South India. Their initial success in Pulicat allowed them to build upon their trading network and secure access to vital resources and trade routes.  The establishment of Pulicat as their first factory illustrates their calculated approach to building a strong presence in the Indian subcontinent.


**3. With reference to the Anglo-French rivalry in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dupleix's ambitious plans for the French included the conquest of Madras, which he briefly achieved in 1746.
2. The Battle of Wandiwash decisively ended the Anglo-French conflict in India, resulting in French territorial losses.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Joseph François Dupleix, the ambitious governor of French India, did indeed aim to expand French influence and power in the subcontinent.  A significant part of his strategy involved capturing Madras, which he temporarily succeeded in doing during the War of the Austrian Succession. Although this victory was short-lived, it highlights Dupleix’s aggressive approach and strategic vision for French dominance in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Battle of Wandiwash in 1760 was pivotal in the Anglo-French struggle.  The British victory dealt a significant blow to French power in India, leading to substantial territorial losses for the French. This battle marked a turning point in the conflict, decisively tilting the balance of power in favor of the British and effectively ending the major phase of French colonial ambitions in India. This outcome underscores the British's superior military capabilities and their growing dominance in the region.


**4.  With reference to the early British presence in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially established factories in Orissa before gaining a foothold in Bengal.
2. The British acquisition of Bombay from Portugal in 1668 immediately led to Surat's decline as a major trading center.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British East India Company's earliest factories in eastern India were indeed located in Orissa, predating their establishment of significant trading posts in Bengal.  This chronological order demonstrates the Company's incremental approach to establishing trade in different parts of the subcontinent.  The Orissa factories served as stepping stones for further expansion and ultimately contributed to the Company’s more prominent presence in Bengal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the acquisition of Bombay did provide the British with a more easily defensible and strategically advantageous port, Surat's decline as a major trading center was a more gradual process, influenced by various factors, including the rise of Maratha power and the shifting dynamics of trade.  Bombay's superior harbor and strategic position did contribute to Surat's relative decline, but this was not an immediate consequence of the acquisition.  The transition of the East India Company's headquarters from Surat to Bombay was a process spanning several years.


**5. With reference to the Mughal-British relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's preoccupation with the Maratha campaigns allowed the British East India Company to expand its influence without significant Mughal opposition.
2. The British initially operated as humble petitioners seeking trading concessions from the Mughal Emperors, but later adopted a more aggressive stance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Aurangzeb's prolonged and resource-intensive campaigns against the Marathas significantly weakened the Mughal Empire's ability to effectively counter the growing influence of the British East India Company. This period of Mughal military preoccupation created a window of opportunity for the British to consolidate their trading posts and gradually expand their power. The Mughal Empire's internal strife and weakening position created a vacuum that the British exploited.

Statement 2 is also correct. The British East India Company's initial interactions with the Mughal Empire were characterized by a posture of deference and requests for trading privileges.  However, as the Company's power and confidence grew, particularly after military successes and increased wealth, they shifted towards a more assertive and expansionist approach, directly challenging Mughal authority and eventually leading to armed conflict.  This transition from a humble petitioner to a powerful political actor demonstrates the Company's evolving ambitions in India.


**6. With reference to Tipu Sultan's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Tipu Sultan established embassies in foreign countries on modern lines, mirroring European diplomatic practices.
2. Tipu Sultan's military innovations included the development and deployment of iron-cased rockets.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Tipu Sultan, recognizing the importance of international relations, did establish embassies in various foreign countries, adopting a more modern approach to diplomacy inspired by European models. This demonstrates his forward-thinking approach to international relations and his willingness to engage with global powers on their own terms. This was a significant departure from the traditional diplomatic practices of Indian rulers.

Statement 2 is also correct. Tipu Sultan, a remarkable military strategist, made significant contributions to military technology.  One of his key innovations was the development and effective use of iron-cased rockets, a technologically advanced weapon for that time period.  The deployment of these rockets in warfare showcases his commitment to military modernization and his efforts to maintain a strong defense against his powerful enemies.  These innovations were also a key factor in his ability to resist British encroachment for some time.


**7. With reference to the early stages of British expansion in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Plassey was primarily a military victory due to the superior military tactics and resources of the British East India Company.
2. Mir Jafar's betrayal of Siraj ud-Daulah played a crucial role in the British victory at the Battle of Plassey.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British East India Company did possess superior weaponry and some tactical advantages, the Battle of Plassey was not solely decided by military prowess.  The decisive factor was the internal treachery within Siraj ud-Daulah's army, particularly Mir Jafar's betrayal, which significantly weakened the Nawab's forces and led to a relatively easy British victory.  The battle was less a demonstration of military superiority and more a consequence of political intrigue and internal conflict.

Statement 2 is correct. Mir Jafar's defection from Siraj ud-Daulah's side was the key turning point in the Battle of Plassey.  His betrayal, along with the lack of support from other commanders, effectively crippled the Nawab's army, enabling the British to achieve victory with minimal losses.  Mir Jafar's switch of allegiance proved to be a decisive factor in securing British control over Bengal. The battle highlights the critical role of political maneuvering and internal conflicts in shaping the British expansion in India.


**8. With reference to the impact of European powers on India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Portuguese significantly impacted Indian society through their introduction of the Inquisition.
2. The French played a crucial role in the development of urban city planning in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Portuguese, during their colonial rule in Goa and other parts of India, did indeed implement the Inquisition, a system of religious persecution aimed at suppressing non-Catholic faiths. This had a lasting impact on Indian society, particularly in Goa, where the Inquisition’s effects are still felt today. The Inquisition exemplifies the Portuguese colonial legacy and its harsh impact on religious freedom and social harmony.

Statement 2 is also correct. The French, during their presence in India, notably in Pondicherry, did contribute to the development of urban city planning. Their influence can be seen in the urban design and infrastructure of Pondicherry, which retains a distinct French character.  This shows that even in a limited colonial presence, European powers could leave a discernible mark on urban development in India.  The French influence on urban planning showcases a less visible but still significant aspect of European colonial impact.


**9. With reference to the Dutch presence in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dutch primarily focused their colonial efforts in India on the spice trade, giving less priority to territorial expansion.
2. The Dutch East India Company established factories in Surat, Pulicat, and Cochin.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Dutch did establish some territorial holdings, their primary interest in India was indeed the spice trade.  Compared to the British and French, who actively pursued territorial expansion, the Dutch prioritized economic gains through trade, particularly in spices, which were highly valuable commodities in Europe.  Their approach highlights the diversity of colonial strategies employed by different European powers in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Dutch East India Company did establish factories in strategically important locations across India, including Surat, Pulicat, and Cochin.  These locations were selected for their access to valuable trade routes and their proximity to key markets. The establishment of these factories across different regions reflects the Dutch aim of securing a wide network for their lucrative spice trade. The spread of Dutch factories across India highlights their commercial interests in the region.


**10. With reference to the East India Company's early conflicts, consider the following statements:**

1.  The conflict with Siraj ud-Daulah resulted from the Company's refusal to pay taxes and its fortification of Calcutta without permission.
2. The war with the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, following the sacking of Hugli, ended disastrously for the British East India Company.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The conflict between the British East India Company and Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, stemmed from the Company's defiance of local authority.  The Company's refusal to pay taxes and its unauthorized fortification of Calcutta directly challenged the Nawab's sovereignty, leading to a confrontation that culminated in the Battle of Plassey. The conflict illustrates the Company's growing disregard for Indian rulers and its increasing assertiveness.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Following the British East India Company's sacking of Hugli, a significant conflict erupted with Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. This war ended with a decisive defeat for the Company, showcasing the limits of their power at that stage and the formidable strength of the Mughal Empire. This defeat forced the Company to adopt a more conciliatory approach for a time, highlighting the precariousness of their position in India at that point.  The war underscores the Mughal Empire's ability to effectively challenge European power at the time.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Maratha expansion and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Marathas' control extended to Malwa, leading to significant territorial gains in the region.
2.  The Thanjavur Nayakas successfully resisted Maratha incursions, maintaining their independent rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Maratha Empire, under various Peshwas and regional leaders, significantly expanded its control across the Deccan and beyond.  Their conquest of Malwa represents a crucial phase in this expansion, bringing vast resources and strategic territories under their dominion. This expansion, however, was not without challenges and internal conflicts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Thanjavur Nayakas, a dynasty ruling in the south, were ultimately defeated by the Marathas. This conquest further solidified Maratha power in the southern regions of India and demonstrates the extent of their military successes against other contemporary powers.  The Marathas’ expansion significantly altered the political landscape of South India.  The Nayakas' defeat highlights the Maratha's capacity to overcome regional rulers and integrate their territories into their vast empire.


**2. With reference to the Maratha interaction with the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shivaji Maharaj's leadership marked the beginning of a significant Maratha rebellion against Mughal rule, leading to prolonged conflicts.
2.  The Maratha's consistently maintained a policy of outright defiance and armed resistance against the Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, throughout their history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Shivaji Maharaj's rebellion against the Mughal Empire is a cornerstone of Maratha history. His guerilla warfare tactics and strategic alliances challenged Mughal authority, paving the way for the subsequent establishment of the Maratha Empire. While there were periods of uneasy peace and even collaboration, his actions initiated a period of prolonged conflict between the Marathas and the Mughals.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Maratha-Mughal relationship was complex and fluctuated between open conflict, uneasy truces, and periods of collaboration. While the Marathas certainly resisted Mughal rule, they also negotiated with Aurangzeb and even served in the Mughal army.  Their strategies involved both armed resistance and shrewd political maneuvering, aiming for regional autonomy rather than complete overthrow of the Mughals initially.  The assertion of consistent defiance simplifies a more nuanced and dynamic historical reality.


**3. With reference to the Maratha's relationship with other powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Marathas forged alliances with Haidar Ali, utilizing these partnerships for strategic gains in their conflicts with other powers.
2.  The Portuguese were consistently subjugated by the Marathas, losing significant territories and naval dominance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Marathas engaged in complex alliances with various powers, including Haidar Ali of Mysore. These alliances were often pragmatic, driven by the need to counter other rivals or consolidate their own power.  The shifting alliances reflect the fluid nature of the political landscape in 18th-century India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Marathas did challenge Portuguese power in India, completely subjugating them is an overstatement. The Portuguese, despite facing setbacks, retained control over significant coastal territories and forts. The relationship was characterized by periods of conflict and negotiation, with the Marathas eventually gaining some territory but not achieving complete dominance over the Portuguese.  The Portuguese continued to be a significant European presence in India throughout the period of Maratha expansion.


**4. Consider the following statements about the early East India Company:**

1. The English East India Company was the first European joint-stock company to trade with India.
2. The Company's initial focus was solely on trade, with no ambitions for territorial control or political influence in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the English East India Company was a significant player in the early stages of European trade with India, it was not the first. The Portuguese established a presence and began trading before them.  Other European powers like the Dutch and French also had joint-stock companies trading in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Company's charter initially focused on trade, its ambitions quickly evolved. The pursuit of profit led to a gradual expansion of its power, involving military actions, the establishment of forts, and ultimately, the assertion of territorial control and political influence.  The Company's trajectory demonstrates the transition from a purely mercantile entity to a powerful colonial power.


**5. With reference to the East India Company's activities in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Company's acquisition of the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1765 significantly enhanced its financial resources and facilitated its expansion.
2. The Company consistently maintained peaceful relations with all Indian rulers throughout its period of operation, prioritizing solely commercial interests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The grant of the Diwani rights, essentially the right to collect revenue, from the Mughal emperor was a pivotal moment for the East India Company. This gave them control over immense financial resources, enabling them to fund military expansions, build infrastructure, and consolidate their power. The control over Bengal's revenue became a cornerstone of their growing dominance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The East India Company's history is characterized by frequent conflicts with various Indian rulers.  Their expansion was fueled by military victories and strategic alliances, often involving the manipulation of internal power struggles within Indian states. The assertion of consistent peaceful relations ignores a substantial body of historical evidence illustrating the Company's military interventions and territorial conquests.


**6.  With reference to the Subsidiary Alliance System, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Subsidiary Alliance system was advantageous to the Indian rulers as it provided them with military protection against external threats.
2.  Lord Wellesley's implementation of the Subsidiary Alliance system was met with widespread approval and acceptance by all Indian rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Subsidiary Alliance offered military protection, it came at a steep price: the loss of sovereignty, the disbandment of native armies, and ultimately, the annexation of territories if the ruler was deemed "inefficient".  The system was a tool of British expansion, not a genuinely beneficial arrangement for Indian rulers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lord Wellesley’s aggressive implementation of the Subsidiary Alliance was met with resistance from many Indian rulers, who saw it as a form of subjugation.  Only those rulers who were already weak or facing imminent threats accepted the alliance, often reluctantly.  The system was a major factor in the escalation of conflict between the British and several Indian powers.


**7. With reference to the Battle of Plassey, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Plassey was a decisive military victory for the British East India Company, significantly increasing their influence in Bengal.
2. The Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah's army was unified and loyal, putting up a strong and determined resistance against the British forces.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Battle of Plassey was indeed a pivotal moment in the British East India Company’s rise to power.  While not a complete annihilation of the Nawab’s forces, the relatively easy victory established the Company's military superiority in Bengal and significantly enhanced their political influence. The battle’s outcome had far-reaching consequences for the future of British dominance in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Siraj-ud-Daulah's army was significantly weakened by internal treachery and disloyalty. Key commanders such as Mir Jafar betrayed the Nawab, either remaining neutral or actively aiding the British. This internal division played a crucial role in the British victory, highlighting the vulnerability of the Nawab's position and the lack of a unified front against the British.  The battle’s outcome was less about military prowess and more about political intrigue and betrayal.


**8. With reference to the early European presence in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dutch established their main trading centers in India at Surat, Bharuch, and Agra.
2. The Portuguese established their first major settlement in India at Calicut.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dutch East India Company established its trading posts in various locations, but their primary centers were on the east coast, not Surat, Bharuch, and Agra, which were more prominent for the English and Portuguese.  The Dutch focused on different trade routes and commodities, resulting in a geographically distinct pattern of settlements.

Statement 2 is correct. The Portuguese, arriving in India early in the 16th century, established their first major settlement at Calicut (Kozhikode) on the Malabar Coast. This established a crucial foothold for their expansion along the western coast of India. The significance of this early settlement in shaping Portuguese colonial ambitions in India is paramount.


**9. With reference to the establishment of British settlements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The English East India Company initially established factories in Orissa in 1633.
2.  Bombay's strategic location and the growing threat of the Maratha power led to Surat being retained as the primary headquarters of the Company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The English East India Company did indeed establish its earliest factories in Orissa in 1633. This marks an early stage of their expansion in eastern India, demonstrating their initial attempts to establish a presence and engage in trade.  The establishment of these factories laid the groundwork for their later expansion in Bengal.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Bombay, due to its strategic harbour and defensibility, quickly surpassed Surat as the Company's western headquarters. The rising Maratha power in the region indeed influenced this shift, as Surat became increasingly vulnerable, whereas Bombay offered a more secure base for operations.  The shift highlights the Company's pragmatic approach to securing its commercial interests in a volatile political environment.


**10. With reference to the administrative structures of the East India Company, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Court of Directors" was the governing body of the East India Company, responsible for its overall management and policies.
2. The Company's internal structure was characterized by a completely open and transparent system of governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Court of Directors was, indeed, the principal governing body of the East India Company.  Elected by the shareholders, this body made key decisions regarding trade, finance, and policy, shaping the Company's direction and actions in India.  The Court of Directors' role in the Company's expansion and its eventual transformation into a major colonial power cannot be overstated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The East India Company's internal structure was far from open and transparent.  It was essentially a closed corporation, with limited accountability and significant opportunities for corruption and self-dealing by its officials.  The Company's governance often lacked transparency, and the pursuit of private gain by its officials was a significant factor in its activities in India.  The lack of transparency and accountability contributed to its eventual downfall.

**1. With reference to the Anglo-Mysore Wars, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Treaty of Mangalore concluded the First Anglo-Mysore War, resulting in the ceding of territories by Hyder Ali to the British.
2.  Tipu Sultan, during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, secured a victory against the British, preventing any territorial concessions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Both statements present inaccurate information regarding the Anglo-Mysore Wars.  Statement 1 incorrectly links the Treaty of Mangalore to the *First* Anglo-Mysore War.  The Treaty of Mangalore actually concluded the *Second* Anglo-Mysore War, and while it did involve territorial concessions, it was not a complete British victory and Hyder Ali did not cede significant territory. The treaty restored territories captured during the war, but it did not result in a definitive British triumph. The First Anglo-Mysore war ended with the Treaty of Madras, which was also not a clear-cut British victory.


Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Tipu Sultan displayed military prowess during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, he did not secure an outright victory that prevented territorial losses. The war concluded with the Treaty of Seringapatam, which involved Mysore ceding significant territories to the British. This treaty was a consequence of the British military pressure and not a testament to Tipu's complete victory.  The outcome of the Third Anglo-Mysore War significantly weakened Mysore's position.  The  British were able to dictate terms and extract territorial concessions as part of the treaty.


The Anglo-Mysore Wars were complex conflicts characterized by shifting alliances and military victories for both sides.  Neither statement accurately reflects the treaties or the ultimate outcome of the wars in question.  A thorough understanding requires a detailed knowledge of each war's individual circumstances and the specific terms of the concluding treaties.



**2. With reference to the reign of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's death in 1707 immediately triggered a widespread rebellion by the Marathas, leading to the rapid disintegration of the Mughal empire.
2.  Bahadur Shah I, Aurangzeb's successor, adopted a policy of religious tolerance, completely reversing Aurangzeb's strict policies and abolishing the jizya tax.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while Aurangzeb's death did contribute to the decline of the Mughal Empire, it didn't immediately cause a widespread Maratha rebellion leading to rapid disintegration.  The process of decline was gradual and multifaceted, involving multiple factors and regional conflicts over an extended period. The Marathas had already been a significant challenge to Mughal authority during Aurangzeb's reign and continued to assert their independence in the years following his death but the disintegration was not immediate.


Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Bahadur Shah I did adopt a more conciliatory approach than Aurangzeb, it wasn't a complete reversal of Aurangzeb's policies, nor did he immediately abolish the jizya tax.  Bahadur Shah I attempted to reconcile with various groups, including the Rajputs and Sikhs, but his policies were more of a pragmatic compromise than a complete abandonment of Aurangzeb’s religious and administrative policies. The abolition of the jizya tax happened later, under different rulers, such as Zulfikar Khan during Jahandar Shah's reign.


The decline of the Mughal Empire was a complex process spanning decades and influenced by various internal and external factors, including succession disputes, economic crises, regional power struggles, and foreign invasions.  Neither statement accurately captures the immediate consequences of Aurangzeb's death or the nature of Bahadur Shah I's policies.  A comprehensive understanding necessitates a nuanced analysis of the period's political and religious dynamics.


**3.  With reference to the early European presence in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Portuguese were the first European power to establish a significant trading presence in India, initially focusing on the west coast, with their first major trading post at Goa.
2.  The English East India Company was formed after the death of Akbar, during the reign of Jahangir, marking the beginning of sustained English involvement in Indian affairs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Portuguese were indeed the first European power to establish a significant and lasting trading presence in India, primarily focusing on the west coast. While their initial explorations and interactions predate the establishment of Goa as a major trading post, it became a crucial center of their influence in India.  The claim that their *first* major trading post was Goa might be debated as they established other settlements earlier, but Goa became their most significant foothold and the foundation of their long-term presence in the region.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The English East India Company was established in 1600, during the reign of Elizabeth I of England.  This predates the death of Akbar (1605) and the beginning of Jahangir's reign. The establishment of the English East India Company marked the beginning of a long process of English involvement in India, but it wasn't immediate or fully realized until much later.  Jahangir's reign saw initial interactions between the English and the Mughal court, but these were relatively limited and did not reflect the full scope of English influence.


The arrival of the Europeans, beginning with the Portuguese, significantly influenced the political and economic landscape of India.  Understanding their individual trajectories and the timing of their key developments is crucial for grasping the broader dynamics of the period.  Statement 1 accurately reflects the Portuguese's early dominance, while statement 2 contains a factual error regarding the founding of the English East India Company.


**4. Consider the following statements about the decline of the Mughal Empire:**

1.  The Jagirdari crisis, characterized by a shortage of land to assign as jagirs, primarily contributed to the weakening of the Mughal army, leading to frequent military defeats and territorial losses.
2.  The rise of regional powers, such as the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats, was a direct consequence of Aurangzeb's religious intolerance, which alienated various groups and fueled widespread rebellions that directly led to the empire's fragmentation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification of the Jagirdari crisis and its impact. While the shortage of land for jagirs did contribute to discontent among the nobility and weakened the Mughal state, it wasn't the sole cause of military defeats and territorial losses.  The Mughal army's decline was a gradual process, influenced by factors beyond the Jagirdari crisis, such as internal conflicts, administrative inefficiencies, and the rise of strong regional powers.  The crisis exacerbated existing problems, but it didn't directly lead to all military defeats.


Statement 2 is an overstated causal relationship.  While Aurangzeb's religious policies did contribute to the alienation of some groups, particularly the Rajputs, the rise of regional powers like the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats was a more complex process stemming from a combination of factors, including the weakening of central authority, economic instability, and the exploitation of Mughal weaknesses.  These groups' rise was not solely a direct result of Aurangzeb's religious policies but rather a result of a confluence of events. The rebellion fueled by Aurangzeb's policies were not the sole cause of the Empire's disintegration.


The decline of the Mughal Empire was a multi-causal phenomenon driven by internal weaknesses and external pressures.  Neither statement accurately captures the full complexity of the causes, oversimplifying the relationship between the Jagirdari crisis, Aurangzeb's policies, and the rise of regional powers.  A comprehensive understanding necessitates a nuanced appreciation of the interplay of various factors.


**5. With reference to the 18th-century Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Indian textile industries, particularly in Bengal, maintained strong export markets in Europe and Asia even in the face of growing competition from European textile producers.
2.  The shipbuilding industry in India experienced a significant decline in the 18th century due to the dominance of European naval powers and a lack of technological advancements in Indian shipyards.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely accurate. Despite the growing presence of European trading companies and the eventual impact of their industrial revolution on global textile markets, Indian textile industries, particularly in Bengal,  maintained significant export markets throughout much of the 18th century.  The demand for Indian textiles, especially fine muslins and other high-quality fabrics, persisted in various parts of Asia and Europe.  However, the statement ignores the fact that the beginning of the decline of Indian textile industry had already started and the competition from European powers was increasing and would eventually have a major impact.


Statement 2 is an oversimplification. While European naval power did increase and eventually impact Indian shipping, the shipbuilding industry in India did not experience a complete decline in the 18th century.  Indian shipyards continued to build and operate ships, though their technological advancements may not have kept pace with European innovations. The decline was gradual and influenced by multiple factors, including the growth of European dominance and internal political instability.  The statement paints too bleak a picture of the state of Indian shipbuilding.


The 18th-century Indian economy presented a complex picture of both strength and vulnerability.  Statement 1 accurately highlights the continued strength of the textile industry, while statement 2 overstates the decline of the shipbuilding sector, ignoring the complexities of the situation. A nuanced understanding requires analyzing the interplay of internal and external factors influencing the Indian economy.


**6. With reference to the political landscape of 18th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of independent regional states like Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad was primarily a consequence of the weakening of the Mughal central authority and the ambitions of provincial governors who successfully asserted their independence.
2. The Maratha Empire, despite its military successes in expanding its influence, ultimately failed to establish a unified and stable all-India empire due to internal divisions and the emergence of powerful rival regional states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The emergence of independent regional states like Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad was a direct consequence of the decline of the Mughal Empire's central authority.  The weakening of the Mughal emperors created a power vacuum, allowing ambitious provincial governors and local rulers to seize opportunities and consolidate their power, leading to the fragmentation of the empire. The decline of the Mughal Empire allowed for the rise of these regional powers.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Maratha Empire, despite its considerable military achievements and expansion of its influence across large parts of India, ultimately failed to consolidate its power into a stable and unified all-India empire.  Internal divisions among Maratha leaders, succession struggles, and the emergence of other strong regional states like the Sikhs and Jats prevented the Marathas from achieving complete dominance. Their inability to create a unified political structure prevented the establishment of a stable all-India empire.  The Third Battle of Panipat significantly weakened their claim to all-India dominance.


The 18th-century Indian political landscape was characterized by the decline of the Mughal Empire and the emergence of various independent and semi-independent regional states.  Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of this transition, highlighting the roles of central authority weakening and the limitations of regional powers in establishing a unified India.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the early history of Delhi, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tomars were a prominent Rajput dynasty that ruled Delhi before the arrival of the Chauhans.
2.  The Qutub Minar, a significant architectural landmark, exemplifies the Mughal architectural style prevalent in Delhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Tomars were indeed a prominent Rajput dynasty that held sway over Delhi before the Chauhans rose to prominence.  Their rule represents a crucial phase in the early history of Delhi, preceding the establishment of more well-known dynasties like the Chauhans and later the Delhi Sultanate.  Understanding the sequence of these dynasties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of Delhi's historical trajectory.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Qutub Minar is located in Delhi, it is not representative of the Mughal architectural style.  It's an example of Indo-Islamic architecture, predating the Mughal period significantly.  The Mughal style emerged later and is characterized by different features and aesthetics. Confusing the Qutub Minar's architectural style with the Mughal style demonstrates a lack of precision in understanding the nuances of Indian architectural history.  Attributing it to the Mughal style shows a misconception regarding the timeline and evolution of architectural styles in Delhi.  This highlights the importance of careful observation and detailed knowledge of historical periods and their respective artistic expressions.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the political landscape of Delhi:**

1.  The Khalji rulers extended their control over Delhi following the demise of the Gahadavala kingdom.
2.  The Lodis, a dynasty of Afghan origin, established their rule in Delhi after the Tughlaqs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Khalji dynasty did rule Delhi, their rise to power wasn't directly linked to the collapse of the Gahadavala kingdom. The chronological sequence of dynasties ruling Delhi is complex, and the relationship between the Gahadavalas and the Khaljis is not a simple succession.  The statement incorrectly links two distinct periods in Delhi's history.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lodis, an Afghan dynasty, did indeed succeed the Tughlaqs in ruling Delhi. This transition marks a significant shift in the political dynamics of the region.  The accurate identification of the chronological order of these dynasties is a key aspect of understanding the political evolution of Delhi.  The correct statement showcases a precise understanding of this historical sequence.  Incorrectly assigning the Lodis to a position before the Tughlaqs reflects a misunderstanding of the historical timeline.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Revolt of 1857 on Delhi, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revolt in Delhi led to the immediate end of the East India Company's rule and the subsequent transfer of power to the British Crown.
2.  The most decisive battle that led to the establishment of British supremacy in India was the Battle of Plassey.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Revolt of 1857 was a significant catalyst in the process, it didn't immediately lead to the dissolution of the East India Company. The company's rule formally ended with the Government of India Act 1858, a process that unfolded over time following the revolt.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate timeline of events.

Statement 2 is partially correct but requires nuanced understanding. The Battle of Plassey is widely considered a pivotal moment in the establishment of British influence in India. However, to label it as the *most* decisive battle is an overstatement. Other battles, particularly those fought later, contributed significantly to the consolidation of British power. The statement is a simplification that overlooks the complex and gradual nature of British conquest.  The question tests the candidate's ability to evaluate the relative importance of different historical events and avoid generalizations.


**4. With reference to the Portuguese presence in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Portuguese established a factory at Bandel, which was known for its strategic location and facilitated their control over the Hooghly River.
2.  The Portuguese presence in Bengal significantly impacted the region's trade, particularly in textiles and silk, leading to economic prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Portuguese did establish a factory at Bandel in Bengal. This location, situated on the Hooghly River, played a significant role in their trade and early colonial activities in the region.  The statement accurately reflects a specific aspect of Portuguese presence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Portuguese presence in Bengal did impact trade, it's inaccurate to describe this impact as leading to "economic prosperity" for the region. Their activities often involved exploitation and disruption, rather than widespread economic benefit for the local population.  The statement oversimplifies the complex economic consequences of colonial presence, highlighting the need for a critical and nuanced understanding of historical impact.  The use of the term "economic prosperity" is a distractor, aiming to mislead candidates who may have a superficial understanding of the Portuguese colonial impact.



**5. With reference to the activities of the East India Company in Bombay, consider the following statements:**

1.  The East India Company acquired Bombay from the Dutch in 1668, strategically establishing a major port on the west coast.
2.  The establishment of Bombay as the headquarters of the Company's western presidency facilitated the English expansion into the Deccan.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The East India Company acquired Bombay from the Portuguese, not the Dutch, in 1668. This acquisition proved crucial in establishing a significant trading post and later a presidency on the western coast of India. The incorrect attribution to the Dutch serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of early European colonial activities in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The shift of the western presidency's headquarters from Surat to Bombay did indeed facilitate English expansion into the Deccan. Bombay's strategic location and port facilities provided a crucial base for their operations in the region.  The statement accurately highlights the importance of geographic location in influencing colonial expansion.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the French East India Company:**

1.  Colbert, the minister of Louis XIV, played a crucial role in establishing the Compagnie des Indes Orientales in 1664.
2.  The French East India Company's initial focus was on establishing extensive territorial control in India, rather than primarily on trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Colbert, the finance minister under Louis XIV, was instrumental in establishing the French East India Company (Compagnie des Indes Orientales) in 1664. His role in shaping the company's early structure and objectives is well-documented.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the French East India Company did have ambitions of territorial expansion, its initial focus was primarily on trade, similar to other European companies of the era.  The statement misrepresents the company's priorities in its formative years, highlighting the need for precise understanding of the motivations of early European colonial ventures. The emphasis on territorial control over trade is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuanced historical context.


**7. With reference to the Anglo-French rivalry in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Wandiwash (1760) marked a decisive turning point in the Anglo-French conflict, resulting in the decline of French influence in India.
2. Dupleix, the French governor, played a key role in the Second Carnatic War by supporting claimants to the thrones of both Hyderabad and the Carnatic.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Battle of Wandiwash in 1760 was indeed a decisive victory for the British, significantly weakening French power in India and paving the way for British dominance.  This victory is a key event in the Anglo-French struggle in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. Dupleix actively intervened in the succession disputes of Hyderabad and the Carnatic, supporting candidates favorable to French interests. His actions significantly escalated the Anglo-French rivalry and shaped the course of the Second Carnatic War.  The accurate identification of Dupleix's role demonstrates a thorough understanding of the political maneuvering that characterized the Anglo-French rivalry.


**8. With reference to Maharaja Ranjit Singh's kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lahore served as the capital of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's kingdom, a strategically important location facilitating trade and control over Punjab.
2.  Ranjit Singh's relations with the British East India Company were consistently marked by open hostility and armed conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lahore was indeed the capital of Ranjit Singh's kingdom, a strategically important location that facilitated trade and control over the Punjab region.  The identification of Lahore as the capital showcases knowledge of the geographic and political center of Ranjit Singh's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Ranjit Singh's relationship with the British East India Company was complex and not consistently characterized by open hostility. While there were periods of tension, there were also periods of cautious cooperation and negotiation.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of a historically nuanced relationship, demonstrating the importance of avoiding generalizations in historical analysis.  The characterization of the relationship as one of "consistent hostility" is a distractor aimed at testing the candidate's ability to assess the complexities of historical interactions.


**9. With reference to Aurangzeb's reign and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's religious policies, particularly the re-imposition of the jizya tax, led to widespread unrest and significantly weakened the Mughal Empire.
2. Aurangzeb's military campaigns in the Deccan, while initially successful, ultimately stretched the resources of the Mughal Empire and contributed to its decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurangzeb's religious policies, including the re-imposition of the jizya tax, did indeed contribute to widespread unrest and dissent within the Mughal Empire. This alienated many non-Muslim subjects and weakened the empire's internal cohesion.  The statement accurately reflects a significant aspect of Aurangzeb's reign and its consequences.

Statement 2 is also correct. Aurangzeb's prolonged military campaigns in the Deccan, though initially yielding territorial gains, placed a considerable strain on the Mughal Empire's resources.  This overextension of resources and the prolonged conflicts contributed to the weakening of the Mughal Empire's overall power and stability. The statement accurately reflects another key aspect of Aurangzeb's reign and its contribution to the Mughal decline.  The combined effect of both statements showcases a comprehensive understanding of the complex factors that led to the decline of the Mughal Empire during Aurangzeb's reign.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Aurangzeb's reign and its impact, the decline of the Mughal Empire, and related events and figures.


**1. With reference to Aurangzeb's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aurangzeb's re-imposition of the jizya tax primarily targeted the peasantry, leading to widespread resentment.
2.  Aurangzeb's adherence to Hanafi school of Muslim law significantly influenced his administrative and judicial reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb did reimpose the jizya tax, its impact was felt most strongly amongst the Hindu population, not primarily the peasantry. The peasantry faced other forms of economic pressure during his reign, but the jizya was a tax specifically levied on non-Muslims.  The text highlights the alienation of the Rajputs, Sikhs, Jats, and Marathas due to this policy.  Focusing on the peasantry as the primary target is a misdirection.

Statement 2 is correct. Aurangzeb's devout adherence to the Hanafi school of Muslim law significantly shaped his legal and administrative decisions. The text indicates his implementation of policies based on Sharia, aligning with the Hanafi school's interpretation. This impacted his judicial reforms, the creation of legal texts like the *Fatawa-i-Alamgiri*, and his overall governance.  The influence of this legal school on his rule was a defining characteristic.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the decline of the Mughal Empire:**

1.  The "jagirdari crisis," characterized by a shortage of land to assign as jagirs, primarily resulted from Aurangzeb's expansionist Deccan policy.
2.  The rise of regional powers like the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats directly challenged Mughal sovereignty and significantly weakened the empire's central authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The jagirdari crisis, stemming from a shortage of land to grant as jagirs to the nobility, was exacerbated by Aurangzeb's prolonged and resource-intensive campaigns in the Deccan. This depleted the available land for distribution, creating discontent among the nobility.  His Deccan policy is directly linked to this economic and administrative problem.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The emergence of powerful regional entities like the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats, fueled by Mughal weakness and internal conflicts, directly challenged the empire's central authority. Their continuous rebellions and the establishment of independent kingdoms significantly weakened the Mughal hold on various parts of the empire, contributing to its eventual fragmentation.  These regional powers did not simply resist; they actively sought to supplant Mughal control.


**3. With reference to the administrative reforms under Lord Cornwallis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cornwallis's reforms aimed to completely separate the revenue administration from judicial functions, abolishing all existing revenue courts (Maal Adalats).
2.  Cornwallis introduced a system of graded civil courts, culminating in an appeal to the King-in-Council for cases exceeding a certain value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cornwallis aimed to separate revenue and judicial functions, the text mentions that the disappearance of Maal Adalats was a consequence of this separation, not a direct result of an explicit abolishment order. The text states that the separation led to their disappearance, implying an indirect consequence rather than a direct action.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key aspect of Cornwallis's judicial reforms was the establishment of a graded system of civil courts, with appeals ultimately going to the King-in-Council for significant cases (those exceeding 5,000 pounds). This structured hierarchy aimed to improve efficiency and fairness in the judicial process.  This hierarchical system is a central feature of his reforms.


**4. With reference to the impact of Aurangzeb's reign on the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The wars of succession following Aurangzeb's death directly led to the immediate collapse of the Mughal Empire.
2. Aurangzeb's policies, while strengthening certain aspects of the Mughal state in the short term, ultimately contributed to the long-term decline of the empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the wars of succession following Aurangzeb's death certainly accelerated the decline, they didn't lead to the *immediate* collapse. The process of disintegration had begun during his reign, and his death merely removed a powerful, albeit flawed, central figure, allowing centrifugal forces to gain greater momentum. The empire's decline was a gradual process spanning decades, not an immediate event.

Statement 2 is correct.  Aurangzeb's reign, despite his strong rule and military success, sowed the seeds of the empire's eventual downfall. His religious policies alienated significant segments of the population, his Deccan policy drained resources, and his administrative practices created long-term problems.  While appearing strong during his lifetime, the underlying weaknesses he created ultimately led to the empire's decline.


**5.  Consider the following statements about the British East India Company's involvement in India:**

1. The Battle of Plassey marked the beginning of the British East India Company's direct political control over significant parts of India, quickly leading to the complete subjugation of the Mughal Empire.
2.  The Treaty of Allahabad formally established the British East India Company's control over the Diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, solidifying their economic and political influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Battle of Plassey was a crucial victory for the British East India Company, it did not immediately lead to complete political control over India, nor did it instantly subjugate the Mughal Empire.  The Company's expansion was a gradual process involving further military victories, political maneuvering, and the exploitation of existing internal conflicts within India. The Mughal Empire's decline was a prolonged process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Treaty of Allahabad (1765) following the Battle of Buxar was a significant turning point, granting the British East India Company the Diwani rights (revenue collection) over Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. This provided them with vast economic resources and strengthened their political position, laying the groundwork for future expansion. The treaty formalized their significant power in the region.



**6. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Cornwallis's reforms focused primarily on increasing the salaries of civil servants to reduce corruption, while simultaneously prohibiting private trade for all civil servants.
2.  The Charter Act of 1853 introduced open competitive examinations for recruitment to the ICS, ending the Company's patronage system and opening the service to Indians on an equal footing with Europeans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplified. Cornwallis did raise salaries and attempt to curb private trade, but the text states that he only *debarred* civil servants from taking presents and bribes, and that the prohibition on private trade was not absolute.  The statement overstates the extent of his reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Charter Act of 1853 did introduce open competitive examinations, it did *not* open the service to Indians on an equal footing.  Indians faced significant barriers to entry, including the examination being held only in England and in English, with requirements of classical Greek and Latin, and a restrictive age limit.  The act represented a step towards meritocracy but did not eliminate systemic discrimination.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Police System in British India:**

1.  The Indian Police Act of 1861, based on the recommendations of the Police Commission of 1860, established a unified, centralized police force across all of British India.
2.  The Frazer Commission (1902-03) recommended establishing training schools for police constables and officers, along with creating a Criminal Intelligence Department at the center.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Police Act of 1861 did not create a completely unified, centralized police force across all of British India. It provided guidelines and a framework, but the actual implementation and structure varied across different provinces.  The British did not create a single, all-India police force.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Frazer Commission's recommendations included establishing training institutions for the police and creating a Criminal Intelligence Department at the center.  These reforms aimed to improve the efficiency and organization of the police force, which was increasingly being used for political repression.  The creation of the CIDs is a direct outcome of the commission's recommendations.


**8. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act completely abolished dyarchy in the provinces, introducing full provincial autonomy with complete control over all subjects.
2.  The Act established a Federal Court in India to interpret the Act and handle inter-state disputes, but appeals could still be made to the Privy Council in London.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did abolish dyarchy in the provinces, introducing provincial autonomy. However, it didn't grant complete control over *all* subjects.  Certain safeguards and reserved powers remained with the governor-general, limiting the extent of provincial autonomy.  The text highlights the governor-general's power to veto bills.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act did establish a Federal Court in India (1937), but it also retained the right of appeal to the Privy Council in London. This maintained a degree of ultimate judicial authority with the British, highlighting the limitations of the Indianization process. The Privy Council's dominance over the Federal Court is a key point.


**9. Consider the following statements about the socio-economic conditions in 18th-century India:**

1.  The 18th-century Indian economy was characterized by a flourishing textile industry, significant exports, and a balanced trade system with minimal reliance on foreign goods.
2.  Despite widespread poverty, the agricultural sector in 18th-century India remained relatively efficient and productive due to the hard work of the peasantry, although the peasants received minimal rewards for their labor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The text describes a thriving textile industry, substantial exports of various goods (textiles, silk, spices, etc.), and a trade system where imports were relatively low due to self-sufficiency in many areas. While the text mentions growing European trade, it emphasizes that India's exports exceeded its imports, leading to an inflow of precious metals. The statement accurately reflects the overall economic picture.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text highlights the stark contrast between the extreme poverty of the majority of the peasantry and the opulence of the elite. However, it acknowledges that the agricultural sector, despite technological backwardness, was productive due to the peasants' hard work.  The peasants, however, received meager compensation for their labor, highlighting the exploitative nature of the agrarian system.


**10. With reference to the successors of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Bahadur Shah I, unlike his father Aurangzeb, adopted a policy of religious tolerance and reconciliation, leading to relative peace and stability during his reign.
2.  The reign of Muhammad Shah, characterized by his luxurious lifestyle, witnessed the emergence of several independent states within the Mughal Empire, significantly weakening its central authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The text portrays Bahadur Shah I as a more conciliatory ruler than Aurangzeb, adopting a policy of compromise with the Rajputs and Marathas.  While complete peace and stability were not achieved, his reign saw a relative easing of tensions compared to the preceding period of Aurangzeb's harsh policies. His reign is described as a period of compromise and conciliation, although not completely successful.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Muhammad Shah's reign, marked by his indulgent lifestyle and weak leadership, saw the rise of independent states in Hyderabad, Bengal, Awadh, and Punjab. This fragmentation of the empire significantly eroded the Mughal Emperor's power and authority, accelerating the decline of the empire. His weak rule is directly linked to this decline in central authority.

**1. With reference to the economic policies of the British in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, aimed to stabilize land revenue and encourage agricultural investment.  
2. The Ryotwari system, prevalent in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly taxed the individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement, introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1793, aimed to fix land revenue permanently with the Zamindars (landlords) in Bengal, Bihar, and parts of Orissa.  While it did aim for revenue stability, its long-term effects were complex and did not always lead to increased agricultural investment.  Some historians argue it led to Zamindari exploitation and hindered the development of peasant proprietorship.  However, the core aim of stabilizing land revenue was a primary objective, making statement 1 largely correct.

The Ryotwari system, implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, differed significantly.  Instead of dealing with intermediaries like Zamindars, it involved the direct assessment and collection of land revenue from individual cultivators (ryots). This direct taxation, indeed, bypassed intermediaries.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  Both systems, despite their differences and varied outcomes, were significant British land revenue policies in India.  Option (c) accurately reflects the core features of both the Permanent Settlement and the Ryotwari system.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only partially address the complexities of British land revenue policies. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements correctly represent fundamental aspects of these systems.



**2. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Brahmo Samaj, primarily based in Calcutta, advocated for monotheism and social reforms like widow remarriage and women's education, directly challenging traditional Hindu practices.
2. The Arya Samaj, founded in Bombay, emphasized Vedic teachings and promoted social reforms such as the shuddhi movement (reconversion of Hindus) and opposed caste discrimination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Brahmo Samaj, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, played a crucial role in the socio-religious reform movement.  Its base was indeed in Calcutta, and it advocated for monotheism, rejecting idolatry and polytheism.  The movement actively championed widow remarriage and women's education, directly challenging orthodox Hindu social norms.  Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.

The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, also contributed significantly to reform.  Its headquarters were in Bombay, and it focused on a return to Vedic principles.  The Arya Samaj's shuddhi movement aimed to reconvert those who had converted to other religions, particularly Islam and Christianity, back to Hinduism.  The movement also actively opposed caste discrimination.  Thus, statement 2 is also correct.  Both movements represented significant attempts to reform Hindu society in the 19th century, making option (c) the accurate choice. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only address one movement each, while option (d) is incorrect because both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Brahmo Samaj and Arya Samaj.



**3. With reference to the impact of British rule on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of cash crops like indigo and opium led to increased agricultural diversification and prosperity for Indian farmers.
2.  The emphasis on revenue extraction through land revenue systems often resulted in peasant indebtedness and land alienation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the British introduction of cash crops like indigo and opium did increase certain agricultural products, the benefits were not evenly distributed.  The cultivation of these crops often involved coercion and exploitative practices, leading to widespread peasant unrest and the destruction of traditional food crops. This resulted in widespread famines and economic hardship. Therefore, statement 1 is largely incorrect. The increased agricultural production of cash crops did not translate into prosperity for the majority of Indian farmers.

Statement 2 accurately reflects a major negative consequence of British rule.  The various land revenue systems (Zamindari, Ryotwari, Mahalwari) primarily aimed at maximizing revenue extraction for the British government. This often resulted in heavy taxation, leading to widespread peasant indebtedness and, in many cases, the loss of land ownership to moneylenders or the British themselves.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Option (b) accurately reflects the negative impact of British land revenue policies. Option (a) is incorrect because it overstates the positive impact of cash crop cultivation. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is largely inaccurate. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of British economic policy.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian National Congress (INC):**

1. The INC initially focused on moderate demands, such as administrative reforms and greater Indian participation in the government, before adopting more assertive strategies.
2.  The INC, from its inception, unequivocally supported complete independence for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian National Congress, established in 1885, initially adopted a moderate approach, focusing on constitutional means to achieve its goals.  Early leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale advocated for administrative reforms, increased Indian representation in government bodies, and greater economic justice.  They believed in working within the existing system to gradually gain concessions. This makes statement 1 correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The INC's initial goals were not aimed at complete independence.  The demand for complete independence (“Purna Swaraj”) only emerged later, particularly after the First World War and the rise of more radical leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and later Mahatma Gandhi.  The early Congress focused on gradual reforms within the British system.  Option (a) correctly reflects the initial moderate phase of the INC. Options (b) and (c) are incorrect as they misrepresent the INC's early stance on independence. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 accurately describes a key phase in the Congress's evolution.


**5. With reference to the  impact of British industrialization on India, consider the following statements:**

1. The establishment of British textile mills in India led to the complete destruction of India's indigenous textile industry and widespread unemployment.
2. The British emphasis on raw material extraction from India hindered the development of Indian industries and manufacturing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The establishment of British textile mills in India did have a devastating impact on the Indian textile industry. However, it did not lead to the complete destruction of the indigenous industry, as pockets of handloom weaving persisted, adapting and finding niche markets.  The British mills, however, significantly undermined the competitiveness of the Indian handloom industry leading to job losses and hardship for many weavers. This makes statement 1 partially correct.

Statement 2 is a more accurate reflection of the broader impact of British industrialization.  The British focused on extracting raw materials from India – cotton, jute, indigo, etc. – to fuel their own industries in Britain.  This policy deliberately stifled the growth of Indian manufacturing and industrialization.  The British often imposed trade restrictions and tariffs that discriminated against Indian goods, hindering the development of indigenous industrial capabilities.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Option (c) represents the combined negative impacts of British industrial policies. Option (a) is incorrect as it overstates the impact on Indian textiles. Option (b) is incorrect as it only addresses one aspect of the colonial industrial policy. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements correctly reflect significant consequences of British industrialization.


**6. With reference to the social consequences of British rule in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of Western education led to the creation of a new class of educated Indians who played a crucial role in the nationalist movement.
2. British social reforms, such as the abolition of Sati and the legalisation of widow remarriage, were universally welcomed and readily adopted by all sections of Indian society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The introduction of Western education, though initially limited and often serving British administrative needs, did create a new class of educated Indians. This educated elite became a driving force behind the nationalist movement, utilizing their knowledge and skills to articulate and organize resistance against colonial rule.  They played a crucial role in disseminating nationalist ideas and mobilizing public opinion.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British abolition of Sati and legalisation of widow remarriage were progressive reforms, they were not universally welcomed.  These actions were met with resistance from certain sections of society, particularly orthodox groups who viewed these as interventions in their religious and social customs.  The implementation of these reforms faced significant social and religious opposition. Option (a) reflects the significant contribution of Western education to the rise of Indian nationalism. Options (b) and (c) are incorrect because statement 2 does not accurately reflect the reception of British social reforms. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 accurately highlights the role of Western education in shaping the nationalist movement.


**7. With reference to the administrative structure of British India, consider the following statements:**

1. The three Presidencies – Bengal, Madras, and Bombay – enjoyed greater autonomy compared to other provinces.
2. The Indian Civil Service (ICS), comprised predominantly of British officers, held key administrative and decision-making positions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The three Presidencies of British India – Bengal, Madras, and Bombay – did indeed hold a more significant position within the administrative structure.  They had their own Governors and Executive Councils, possessing greater autonomy in their governance compared to other provinces which were under Lieutenant Governors or Chief Commissioners. This autonomy, however, was limited by the ultimate authority of the Governor-General in Council.  Therefore, statement 1 is largely correct.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Indian Civil Service (ICS) was the backbone of the British Indian administration.  It was overwhelmingly composed of British officers who held the most powerful positions in the administration, controlling revenue collection, law enforcement, and other key aspects of governance.  The ICS played a crucial role in maintaining British control and implementing policies.  Option (c) accurately reflects the structure of British India. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only partially describe the administrative structure. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements correctly reflect important aspects of the British Indian administration.


**8.  Consider the following statements about the impact of British rule on Indian society:**

1. The introduction of railways facilitated the integration of different parts of India, leading to greater economic and cultural exchange.
2. The British policy of divide and rule exacerbated existing social and religious tensions, weakening the overall unity of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The construction of railways under British rule had a profound impact on India.  It did indeed facilitate the integration of different regions, connecting distant areas and improving trade and communication. This integration had both positive and negative consequences. While it did facilitate economic and cultural exchange, it also served to strengthen British control and facilitate the movement of troops.  Statement 1 is therefore largely correct.

Statement 2 is also correct. The British actively pursued a policy of "divide and rule," exploiting existing social and religious cleavages to weaken resistance to their rule.  They often played different religious and caste groups against each other, exacerbating tensions and undermining the unity of India. This policy had long-lasting consequences on Indian society and politics. Option (c) is the correct answer because both statements correctly identify major impacts of British rule. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only address one aspect of British influence. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements correctly reflect significant consequences of British rule.


**9. With reference to the events leading to the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the Enfield rifle, whose cartridges were rumored to be greased with animal fat, offended the religious sensibilities of both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.
2. The annexation of Awadh, a region with a significant number of sepoys in the British army, further fueled discontent among the sepoys.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The rumors surrounding the Enfield rifle cartridges, allegedly greased with animal fat (beef and pork), deeply offended both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.  The act of biting into the cartridge was seen as a violation of religious dietary laws, triggering widespread resentment and anger within the sepoy ranks. This religious affront, fueled by existing grievances, played a significant role in igniting the mutiny. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie in 1856 further exacerbated the situation. Awadh was a major recruitment ground for the British army, and the annexation resulted in the loss of livelihoods and status for many sepoys and their families. This political grievance added to the existing religious and economic discontent, contributing to the widespread mutiny.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct. Option (c) accurately reflects the combination of factors leading to the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they address only one aspect. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements correctly identify important contributing factors to the mutiny.


**10. With reference to the consequences of the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The British Crown assumed direct control over India, ending the rule of the East India Company.
2. The mutiny led to a significant increase in the number of Indian soldiers in the British Indian army to compensate for the losses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 had far-reaching consequences.  A key outcome was the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown. The Government of India Act of 1858 formally dissolved the Company's political authority and established direct rule by the British Crown, marking a significant shift in the governance of India.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The British response to the mutiny did not involve increasing the number of Indian soldiers. Instead, the British drastically reorganized the army, reducing the proportion of Indian sepoys and increasing the number of British troops.  The British sought to reduce the risk of future mutinies by altering the army's structure and composition.  Option (a) accurately reflects the major administrative change. Options (b) and (c) are incorrect because statement 2 misrepresents the British response. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 accurately describes a key consequence of the mutiny.

**1. With reference to the 18th-century political landscape of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nawab of Awadh, initially a relatively strong power, eventually ceded significant territories to the British East India Company under the pressure of subsidiary alliances.
2.  The Maratha Empire, despite its initial military successes against the British, experienced internal conflicts that hindered its ability to effectively resist British expansion.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Nawab of Awadh, initially a powerful independent state, became increasingly reliant on British protection through the Subsidiary Alliance system. This system, while ostensibly providing protection, resulted in the Nawab's gradual loss of sovereignty and territorial concessions to the British East India Company.  The British strategically exploited the Nawab's dependence, eventually leading to the annexation of significant portions of Awadh. This demonstrates the manipulative nature of the Subsidiary Alliance as a tool of British expansion.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Maratha Empire, a formidable power in 18th-century India, faced several internal challenges that weakened its ability to unify against the British threat.  The death of key leaders and the ensuing power struggles among the Maratha chiefs—the Peshwa, Scindia, Holkar, and Bhonsle—created divisions and hampered their collective resistance.  These internal conflicts allowed the British to exploit the situation, gradually expanding their influence and ultimately defeating the Marathas in a series of wars. The inability to maintain internal cohesion proved a fatal flaw for the Marathas in their struggle against the British.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Battle of Plassey (1757):**

1.  The Battle of Plassey marked the beginning of the British East India Company's direct political control over Bengal, laying the foundation for their subsequent expansion across India.
2.  Mir Jafar's betrayal of Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, played a pivotal role in the British victory at Plassey, showcasing the crucial role of internal conflicts in British expansion.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Battle of Plassey is widely considered a turning point in British expansion in India.  The British victory, achieved through superior military tactics and strategic alliances, decisively weakened the Nawab of Bengal and established the Company's dominance in the region. This victory provided the British with a foothold for subsequent expansion into other parts of India, demonstrating the strategic importance of this battle in shaping British India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Mir Jafar's defection to the British side was a critical factor in their victory at Plassey.  His betrayal of Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, resulted in the weakening of the Nawab's army and significantly contributed to the British triumph. This highlights the British strategy of exploiting internal divisions among Indian rulers to achieve their expansionist goals. The incident underscores the importance of internal conflicts and alliances in determining the outcome of major political and military events.


**3. With reference to the political and territorial changes in 18th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Treaty of Salbai (1782) concluded the First Anglo-Maratha War, resulting in a temporary stalemate but ultimately paving the way for further British expansion.
2.  Banaras, initially under the control of Awadh, was later ceded to Shah Alam II, the Mughal emperor, reflecting the shifting power dynamics of the time.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Treaty of Salbai, signed in 1782, formally ended the First Anglo-Maratha War. While it didn't result in a clear victory for either side, the treaty essentially maintained the status quo ante bellum. However, this "peace" was a temporary one, offering the British a crucial period to consolidate their power in Bengal and prepare for future conflicts with the Marathas, ultimately leading to their eventual dominance. The treaty highlights the complexities of 18th-century warfare and the strategic maneuvering employed by the British to achieve their long-term objectives.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly states that Banaras and surrounding tracts were detached from Awadh and given to Shah Alam II.  This act demonstrates the fragmentation of Mughal power and the fluctuating alliances among the various regional powers in 18th-century India.  The transfer of Banaras highlights the changing political landscape and the strategic importance of this territory, reflecting the shifting balance of power among the major players.  The event serves as a microcosm of the broader political realignments that characterized this era.


**4. With reference to the British policy towards Afghanistan in the first half of the 19th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British aimed to annex Afghanistan as a directly controlled territory, viewing it as strategically important for their broader imperial ambitions in Asia.
2.  The British primarily sought to weaken Russian influence in Afghanistan, using it as a buffer zone against further Russian expansion into India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British certainly had expansionist ambitions, outright annexation of Afghanistan was not their primary goal in the first half of the 19th century.  Their policies were more nuanced, focusing on preventing Afghanistan from falling under the complete control of a rival power. This is because a direct annexation would have involved significant military resources and the challenges of controlling a fiercely independent and mountainous region.

Statement 2 is correct. The Great Game, a period of intense geopolitical rivalry between Britain and Russia in Central Asia, significantly influenced British policy towards Afghanistan.  The British viewed Afghanistan as a crucial buffer state to protect their Indian territories from Russian expansion.  Their aim was to prevent Russia from gaining a foothold in Afghanistan, which would have posed a direct threat to India.  This strategy involved supporting various Afghan rulers and intervening militarily whenever perceived Russian influence grew too strong. The British approach demonstrates a calculated strategy aimed at maintaining regional stability and safeguarding their interests in India.


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding the 18th-century State of Arcot:**

1.  The founders of the Arcot dynasty were Daud Khan Panni and Saadatullah Khan, establishing a powerful state in South India.
2.  The State of Arcot became the site of a protracted struggle between the English and French East India Companies, shaping the political landscape of the region.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the provided text mentions the emergence of the state of Arcot, it does not name its founders as Daud Khan Panni and Saadatullah Khan.  The text focuses more on the broader political context and the conflicts that shaped the region.  It is crucial to rely on accurate historical information when addressing such questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions that Arcot became a key location in the prolonged struggle between the English and French East India Companies in the 1740s. This conflict significantly influenced the power dynamics of South India and was instrumental in shaping the eventual British dominance in the region.  The statement accurately reflects the historical context and the role of Arcot in the Anglo-French rivalry.  The competition for control of Arcot served as a crucial stepping stone for both powers in their broader ambitions in South India.


**6. With reference to the penetration of English influence into Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  Job Charnock's arrival in Sutanati in August 1690 directly led to the establishment of Calcutta, which later became the center of the British Indian Empire.
2.  The French East India Company built a fort near Fort William in Calcutta, signifying the intense Anglo-French rivalry in the region.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the provided text does not explicitly state that Job Charnock's arrival *directly* led to the establishment of Calcutta, it does mention his arrival in Sutanati and the subsequent development of Calcutta as a significant British settlement.  The text supports the idea that Charnock's presence was a crucial step in the process, even if it wasn't the sole determining factor. The establishment of Calcutta as a major British center is well-documented in historical sources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text does not support this claim. While the text mentions Anglo-French rivalry, it does not mention the French building a fort near Fort William in Calcutta.  It's important to avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions that are not supported by the provided information.  Accurate historical knowledge is essential to answer this question correctly.  The absence of supporting evidence renders this statement incorrect.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the establishment of British rule in India:**

1. The Battle of Buxar provided the British East India Company with the key to establishing its rule in India, significantly expanding their influence and control.
2. The Treaty of Allahabad (1765), concluded after the Battle of Buxar, enabled the British to establish their rule in Bengal, laying the groundwork for further expansion.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The decisive British victory at the Battle of Buxar (1764) dramatically shifted the power balance in India. The defeat of the combined forces of the Mughal emperor, Shah Alam II, and the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daulah, significantly weakened their authority and strengthened the British East India Company's position. This victory paved the way for the Company's acquisition of the Diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, marking a crucial step towards establishing their dominance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Treaty of Allahabad (1765), signed in the aftermath of the Battle of Buxar, formally granted the British East India Company the Diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.  This granted them control over the revenue collection in these regions, which formed the economic foundation for their further expansion and consolidation of power.  The treaty effectively established the Company's dominance in Bengal, becoming a crucial stepping stone in their expansion across India.  The treaty highlights the strategic use of military victories to secure political and economic control.

**1. With reference to the participants and impact of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revolt saw widespread participation from Sikhs, significantly contributing to its success in Punjab.
2.  The immediate consequence of the revolt was the complete dismantling of the Mughal Empire and the transfer of power directly to the British Crown.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Revolt of 1857 did involve some participation from various groups, including soldiers from the British Indian Army, the Sikhs largely remained loyal to the British during the revolt.  Their support played a crucial role in suppressing the rebellion in Punjab and other areas. The revolt lacked a unified pan-Indian character, and regional loyalties often overshadowed any broader nationalist sentiment.  Therefore, attributing significant success to Sikh participation is an oversimplification and inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Revolt of 1857, though a significant challenge to British authority, did not lead to an immediate complete dismantling of the Mughal Empire and direct transfer of power to the British Crown. While Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Mughal Emperor, was implicated and subsequently exiled, the British East India Company's rule was gradually transitioned into direct rule by the British Crown through the Government of India Act 1858. This process involved a series of political and administrative changes, not a sudden, complete takeover. The Mughal Empire's influence was already significantly diminished before 1857, and the revolt accelerated but didn't directly cause its ultimate demise.  The transition to direct Crown rule was a complex process spanning several years and involved legislative and administrative changes.


**2. With reference to the economic causes of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British land revenue policies, particularly the Permanent Settlement, led to widespread prosperity among Indian peasants, thereby negating any economic grievances.
2.  The decline of traditional Indian industries and the impoverishment of artisans were significant factors contributing to the widespread discontent that fueled the revolt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British land revenue policies, while intending to streamline revenue collection, had devastating consequences for many Indian peasants. The Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari systems, while differing in their mechanisms, often resulted in high tax burdens, dispossession of land, and increased indebtedness among cultivators. This economic hardship, far from generating prosperity, significantly contributed to the widespread resentment that fueled the Revolt of 1857.  The systems created inequalities and led to the rise of absentee landlords, further marginalizing the peasantry.

Statement 2 is correct. The British economic policies significantly damaged traditional Indian industries. The introduction of British manufactured goods, coupled with discriminatory policies favoring British products, led to the decline of indigenous industries like textiles, handicrafts, and others.  This resulted in widespread unemployment and impoverishment among artisans and weavers, adding to the existing economic grievances and fueling the discontent that culminated in the 1857 revolt. The destruction of traditional economic structures created widespread poverty and desperation, making people more susceptible to participating in the rebellion.


**3. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, primarily focused on the revival of traditional Hindu practices and vehemently opposed any social reforms challenging orthodox beliefs.
2.  The Brahmo Samaj, while advocating for social reforms like widow remarriage, remained largely detached from the broader political landscape of the time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arya Samaj, though aiming at a return to Vedic principles, actively advocated for several social reforms, including widow remarriage, opposing child marriage, and challenging the caste system.  Swami Dayanand's teachings emphasized monotheism and rational inquiry, leading to a reformist agenda that challenged some orthodox Hindu beliefs. While respecting traditional scriptures, the Arya Samaj actively sought to reform Hindu society and remove practices deemed socially harmful.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Brahmo Samaj, while initially focusing on religious reform, became increasingly involved in social and political issues during the 19th century.  Prominent Brahmo Samaj members actively participated in social reform movements, advocating for the abolition of Sati, widow remarriage, women's education, and other progressive causes.  The movement's leaders and followers were also involved in broader political discussions and debates of the time, contributing to the intellectual and social currents that shaped modern India.  Their involvement extended beyond purely religious matters.


**4. With reference to the role of women in the Indian freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1.  Women's participation in the freedom movement was primarily limited to supporting roles, such as providing logistical assistance and participating in non-violent protests.
2.  Sarojini Naidu's contribution to the freedom struggle was primarily focused on her literary works, which inspired nationalist sentiments, rather than direct political activism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Women played a multifaceted and crucial role in the Indian freedom struggle, extending far beyond supporting roles. They participated in active protests, boycotts, civil disobedience movements, and even revolutionary activities.  Women faced imprisonment, police brutality, and other hardships alongside their male counterparts. Their contributions were integral to the success of many movements and significantly shaped the nationalist narrative.  Their role was not merely supportive but actively transformative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Sarojini Naidu was a renowned poetess whose work fostered nationalist sentiment, her contribution to the freedom struggle significantly extended beyond her literary pursuits.  She was a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, holding the presidency, and actively participated in various political campaigns and movements.  She was a powerful orator, mobilizing support and inspiring action.  Her role was a powerful combination of political action and literary influence.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of British rule on Indian society:**

1. The British administration actively promoted social reforms aimed at uplifting marginalized communities and challenging traditional caste hierarchies.
2. The introduction of modern education and the spread of Western ideas played a significant role in undermining traditional social structures, including the caste system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some individual British officials and missionaries may have supported social reforms, the British administration's overall policy regarding social reform was inconsistent and often ambivalent.  In many instances, the British government's actions prioritized maintaining social order and stability over actively promoting radical social change that might destabilize their rule.  They often sided with conservative elements in society to maintain control.  Their approach was often pragmatic rather than actively reformist.

Statement 2 is correct. The introduction of modern education by the British, coupled with the spread of Western ideas like rationalism, liberalism, and humanism, played a crucial role in challenging traditional social structures in India.  These new ideas provided the intellectual framework for social reformers who critiqued traditional practices like Sati, child marriage, and the caste system.  The new education system also provided opportunities for marginalized communities to access knowledge and challenge their subordinate position.  The impact of Western ideas was largely indirect but profoundly influential.

**1. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in 19th century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Brahmo Samaj, while advocating monotheism, completely rejected the authority of the Vedas and Upanishads.
2.  The Prarthana Samaj primarily focused on reforming Hindu religious practices in Maharashtra, emphasizing the worship of one God and challenging priestly dominance, but retained a degree of caste hierarchy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Brahmo Samaj, while advocating monotheism and criticizing idolatry and ritualistic excesses, did *not* completely reject the Vedas and Upanishads.  They considered these texts to contain essential spiritual truths but interpreted them rationally, rejecting the literal interpretations and priestly authority often associated with them.  They sought to reform Hinduism from within, not completely abandon its scriptures.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Prarthana Samaj, active in Maharashtra, aimed to reform Hindu religion by promoting monotheism and challenging the excessive influence of priests. However, while they opposed the rigidities of the caste system, they did not entirely eliminate caste distinctions from their social structure.  The movement's reformist efforts were primarily focused on religious practices and theological interpretations rather than a complete overhaul of the social hierarchy.  The subtle distinction regarding the persistence of some caste hierarchy within the Prarthana Samaj makes it a more nuanced and challenging statement to assess, requiring deeper knowledge of the movement's complexities.


**2. With reference to the challenges faced by women in traditional Indian society and the responses of reform movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Age of Consent Act of 1891, primarily driven by the efforts of Behramji Malabari, raised the legal marriageable age for girls to 18 years.
2.  The Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856, largely due to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's advocacy, legalized widow remarriage and granted legitimacy to children born from such unions, completely eliminating social stigma associated with it.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Age of Consent Act of 1891, while a significant step, did *not* raise the marriageable age for girls to 18. It raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse to 12, which was a crucial move in addressing the issue of child marriage, but it did not directly alter the legal marriage age.  The legal marriageable age was addressed later through other legislation.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856, significantly advanced by Vidyasagar, legalized widow remarriage and granted legitimacy to offspring from such marriages. However, the statement's claim that it *completely* eliminated social stigma is an oversimplification. While the law provided legal sanction, significant social stigma and resistance persisted in many parts of society for a considerable time after the act's passage. The persistence of social resistance despite legal reform highlights the limitations of legal changes in altering deeply entrenched social norms.


**3. With reference to the role of religious reform movements in shaping modern India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda's teachings emphasized the rejection of all traditional Hindu practices and the adoption of a purely Westernized approach to spirituality and social reform.
2.  The Arya Samaj, while advocating a return to Vedic principles, actively opposed untouchability and worked towards social equality.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Swami Vivekananda's message was far from a rejection of all traditional Hindu practices.  While he advocated for social reform and a more active engagement with the world, he strongly emphasized the universality of spiritual truths found in various religions, including Hinduism's rich philosophical tradition (Vedanta). He sought to revitalize Hinduism, adapting it to the modern context, not discarding it entirely.  His emphasis on self-reliance and social service was deeply rooted in his interpretation of Hindu philosophy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayananda Saraswati, focused on a return to the original Vedic principles, but this did not imply social conservatism.  The movement actively opposed untouchability and championed social equality, aiming to purify Hinduism and remove what they saw as later accretions that contradicted its core values.  Their reformist approach included social activism alongside their religious tenets.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of British rule on Indian society:**

1. The British administration's introduction of a uniform legal system consistently promoted social equality by undermining traditional caste-based distinctions and practices.
2. The British educational system, while introducing modern subjects, simultaneously attempted to suppress indigenous knowledge systems and discouraged the use of vernacular languages in education.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British introduced a uniform legal system, its impact on social equality was far more complex and not uniformly positive.  While the system theoretically offered equality before the law, its implementation often favored certain groups and did not effectively dismantle caste-based discrimination in all areas.  The persistence of caste-based social inequalities despite the presence of a uniform legal system demonstrates the limitations of legal reforms in addressing deeply ingrained social structures.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The British educational system, while introducing Western knowledge and skills, often marginalized or suppressed indigenous knowledge systems and discouraged the use of vernacular languages in favor of English. This policy aimed to create a class of English-educated Indians who would serve the colonial administration, but it had the unintended consequence of undermining the intellectual and cultural heritage of India.  The emphasis on English as the medium of instruction further contributed to the marginalization of regional languages and knowledge systems.


**5. With reference to the efforts to eradicate untouchability in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The All India Harijan Sangh, founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932, solely focused on religious conversions as a means to achieve social equality for the Dalits.
2.  B.R. Ambedkar, while fighting against caste discrimination, advocated for the complete annihilation of the caste system and rejected the possibility of reforming Hinduism from within.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The All India Harijan Sangh, established by Gandhi, aimed to uplift the Dalits within the framework of Hinduism, primarily through social reform and awareness campaigns.  While Gandhi did not oppose conversions, the Sangh's core strategy was not focused solely on religious conversions.  It involved a multifaceted approach to tackle untouchability through various social and political means.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  B.R. Ambedkar's critique of the caste system was far more radical than many other reformists. He viewed it as inherently oppressive and irredeemable, advocating for its complete eradication.  He did not believe that Hinduism could be reformed from within to achieve social justice for the Dalits and explored alternative paths, including the possibility of Dalits embracing Buddhism.  His perspective on the caste system and its incompatibility with social justice contrasts sharply with Gandhi's approach.

**1. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The immediate trigger for the revolt was the introduction of the Enfield rifle, whose cartridges were rumoured to be greased with animal fat, offending both Hindu and Muslim religious sensibilities.
2.  The revolt was primarily confined to the sepoys of the British Indian Army, with limited participation from the civilian population and rulers of princely states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The greased cartridges of the Enfield rifle were indeed a significant, immediate trigger for the revolt.  The rumour, whether true or not, ignited widespread resentment and distrust among sepoys, many of whom refused to use the cartridges, leading to initial acts of defiance and ultimately, the widespread mutiny. This religious element played a crucial role in escalating the initial mutiny into a larger rebellion.  While other underlying factors contributed to the widespread discontent, the greased cartridges served as the catalyst that sparked the initial uprising.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the revolt began with the sepoy mutiny, it rapidly expanded beyond the confines of the army.  The rebellion encompassed vast swathes of northern and central India, drawing in significant numbers of civilians, peasants, and even some princely rulers who harbored grievances against the British.  The participation was not limited to the sepoys alone; it represented a broader expression of discontent against British rule, fueled by economic exploitation, political subjugation, and socio-religious concerns. The extent of civilian participation varied regionally, but it was substantial enough to characterize the event as a widespread popular uprising, far exceeding a mere military revolt. The limited participation of princely states is a matter of debate and is not entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the social and religious reform movements of 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arya Samaj, founded in 1875, vehemently opposed the practice of child marriage and advocated for widow remarriage, aligning with the broader social reform agenda of the time.
2.  The Brahmo Samaj, under Keshab Chandra Sen, actively campaigned for women's education and challenged traditional Hindu social hierarchies, promoting a more egalitarian society.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati in 1875 (not 1835 as stated in the original prompt), was a significant social and religious reform movement.  A core tenet of the Arya Samaj was the return to Vedic principles, which they interpreted as supporting social reforms such as the abolition of child marriage and the encouragement of widow remarriage.  Their emphasis on education and social upliftment contributed significantly to the broader reformist movement.  The movement's impact on social practices was considerable, challenging traditional norms and contributing to a shift in societal attitudes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Brahmo Samaj, particularly under the leadership of Keshab Chandra Sen, played a pivotal role in advocating for women's education and challenging social inequalities.  Sen's reformist agenda went beyond the earlier, more moderate Brahmo Samaj, pushing for broader social change and criticizing practices like caste discrimination and the purdah system.  The Brahmo Samaj's advocacy significantly impacted the discourse on women's rights and contributed to the growth of educational opportunities for women in various parts of India.  The movement's emphasis on rationalism and social justice influenced subsequent reform movements and contributed to the overall social and intellectual transformation of the 19th century.



**3. With reference to the participants in the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nana Sahib, the adopted son of the last Peshwa, led the revolt in Lucknow, showcasing significant military prowess and strategic planning.
2.  Kunwar Singh, a zamindar from Bihar, played a crucial role in organizing and leading the revolt in Awadh, demonstrating exceptional military leadership despite his advanced age.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nana Sahib led the revolt in Kanpur, not Lucknow.  While he displayed considerable military capabilities in expelling the British from Kanpur initially, his leadership was marred by controversial actions, including the massacre of British prisoners.  His role in the revolt was significant, but his association with Lucknow is inaccurate.  The revolt in Lucknow was primarily led by Begum Hazrat Mahal.

Statement 2 is correct. Kunwar Singh, despite his advanced age (around 80 years old), was a prominent military leader of the Revolt of 1857, particularly in Bihar. He effectively organized and led the resistance in Bihar, and his strategic acumen and military skills were remarkable, contributing significantly to the prolonged struggle against the British in that region. His later collaboration with Nana Sahib's forces extended his influence to other areas as well.  His leadership stands out as a testament to the diverse participation and leadership within the revolt.


**4. With reference to the impact of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The revolt directly led to the immediate abolition of the East India Company's rule and the direct assumption of control by the British Crown, marking a significant shift in the governance of India.
2. The revolt resulted in a widespread reassessment of British policies in India, leading to significant administrative and military reforms aimed at preventing future uprisings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Revolt of 1857 directly led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the transfer of power to the British Crown.  The Crown's assumption of direct control over India was a direct consequence of the rebellion, reflecting the British government's recognition of the instability and inadequacy of the Company's rule.  This marked a significant turning point in the history of British India, fundamentally altering the structure of governance.

Statement 2 is also correct. The revolt prompted a thorough review of British policies and administration in India. The British government understood the need for significant changes to prevent future uprisings. This led to substantial reforms in the military, including a reduction in the proportion of Indian sepoys and an increase in British troops, and administrative reforms aimed at addressing some of the grievances that fueled the rebellion.  These reforms, while not addressing the fundamental issue of colonial rule, demonstrated a response to the challenges posed by the revolt.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The formation of the United Provinces Kisan Sabha in 1918 included Jawaharlal Nehru among its founding members, reflecting his early involvement in peasant mobilization.
2. Madan Mohan Malviya, a prominent leader of the moderate nationalist faction, actively participated in the formation of the U.P. Kisan Sabha, demonstrating a commitment to rural upliftment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jawaharlal Nehru was a prominent figure in the Indian nationalist movement and later became deeply involved in rural development, he was not associated with the formation of the U.P. Kisan Sabha in 1918.  His involvement in peasant movements came later in his political career.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Madan Mohan Malaviya was a prominent leader in the early nationalist movement, but he was primarily associated with the moderate nationalist faction and played a less direct role in the formation of peasant organizations like the U.P. Kisan Sabha. His focus was more on constitutional politics and educational reform.  The formation of the U.P. Kisan Sabha involved other key figures, primarily those aligned with the more radical elements within the nationalist movement at that time.


**6.  With reference to the geographical locations affected by the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revolt significantly impacted Chittor in Rajasthan, a strategically important location, showcasing the widespread nature of the rebellion.
2.  Jagdishpur in Bihar, the ancestral home of Kunwar Singh, remained unaffected by the revolt, highlighting the uneven spread of the rebellion across different regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Revolt of 1857 did significantly impact several regions of India. While the intensity of the revolt varied, the rebellion had a presence in various parts of the country, including regions like Rajasthan.  Chittor, given its historical significance and strategic location, would have likely been affected by the broader unrest and upheaval during the revolt even if the main fighting did not occur there. The rebellion's impact was not uniform, but it extended beyond the primary storm centers.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Jagdishpur in Bihar, the ancestral home of Kunwar Singh, was a key center of the revolt in Bihar. Kunwar Singh’s leadership and military actions in and around Jagdishpur were a significant part of the overall rebellion. The area saw considerable fighting and was not unaffected.  The statement misrepresents the role of Jagdishpur and Kunwar Singh's activities during the revolt.


**7. With reference to the Bhoodan Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Acharya Vinoba Bhave initiated the Bhoodan Movement from Pochampalli in Andhra Pradesh, marking the beginning of his land reform initiative.
2.  The initial focus of the Bhoodan Movement was on securing land donations from wealthy landowners in the southern states of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Acharya Vinoba Bhave launched the Bhoodan Movement from Pochampalli in Andhra Pradesh. This marked the symbolic beginning of his campaign to persuade wealthy landowners to voluntarily donate land to landless peasants.  The choice of Pochampalli was strategic, given its location and the existing social and economic conditions.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Bhoodan Movement did indeed aim to secure land donations from wealthy landowners, its initial focus was not exclusively on the southern states.  While the movement gained momentum in the south, it spread to other parts of India as well, aiming for a nationwide impact on land distribution. The movement's success varied regionally, but its ambition was not confined to the south.


**8. With reference to the novel *Anand Math* by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, consider the following statements:**

1. *Anand Math* fictionalizes the Sanyasi rebellion, portraying the struggles of ascetic warriors against the oppressive Mughal regime.
2. The novel's depiction of the Sanyasi rebellion played a significant role in shaping the narrative of Indian nationalism and inspiring subsequent revolutionary movements.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. *Anand Math*, a historical novel by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, is a fictionalized account of the Sanyasi rebellion, although the historical accuracy is debated. The novel portrays the Sanyasis (ascetic warriors) as fighting against the oppressive Mughal rule, although this depiction is not entirely accurate as the main conflict was against the British East India Company. The novel utilizes the rebellion as a backdrop to explore themes of patriotism, religious identity, and the struggle against tyranny.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The novel's portrayal of the Sanyasi rebellion, while fictionalized, had a considerable impact on shaping the narrative of Indian nationalism.  The image of the Sanyasis fighting for freedom became a powerful symbol, inspiring subsequent revolutionary movements and contributing to the development of a sense of national identity and resistance against foreign rule.  The novel's themes resonated with nationalist sentiments and contributed to the broader anti-colonial discourse.  The song "Vande Mataram," featured in the novel, became a powerful anthem of Indian nationalism.

**1. With reference to the Servants of India Society, consider the following statements:**

1. The Servants of India Society remained aloof from active participation in electoral politics, focusing primarily on social reform and nation-building initiatives.
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, inspired by the ideals of social service and self-rule, founded the Servants of India Society.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Servants of India Society, founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, distinguished itself from other contemporary organizations by its deliberate choice to remain largely aloof from direct involvement in party politics and electoral contests.  Its primary focus was on long-term nation-building through social reform, education, and the promotion of ethical governance.  While its members were undoubtedly involved in broader political discussions and influenced policy indirectly,  the Society's operational strategy emphasized sustained, non-partisan work rather than direct competition for political power. This approach reflects a specific strategic vision within the broader nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. Gopal Krishna Gokhale played a pivotal role in establishing the Servants of India Society in 1905.  Inspired by the need for dedicated, selfless individuals to serve the nation, he envisioned a body of trained workers committed to social reform and self-governance. The Society’s founding was a direct consequence of Gokhale’s commitment to both immediate social improvements and the long-term development of a self-governing India. He drew inspiration from his own political and social engagement and the limitations of other approaches to national reform.  The Society’s establishment represents a significant organizational development within the Indian nationalist movement.



**2. With reference to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's primary focus was on educational reform, specifically advocating for the inclusion of non-Brahmins in Sanskrit College and developing new Bengali primers to improve literacy.
2.  While known for his educational reforms, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a minor role in the social reform movements of his time, primarily focusing on his academic pursuits.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar made significant contributions to education. His efforts to open Sanskrit College to non-Brahmins were groundbreaking and challenged the rigid caste system prevalent in society.  Furthermore, his creation of new Bengali primers significantly impacted literacy rates, making education more accessible to a wider population. These actions demonstrate his commitment to social mobility and accessibility through educational reform.  His work represents a crucial aspect of 19th-century social and educational changes in Bengal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vidyasagar was a prominent figure in the social reform movements of his time.  While his educational reforms were a substantial part of his work, he was actively involved in advocating for widow remarriage, opposing child marriage and polygamy, and championing women's education. These actions showcase his broader commitment to social justice beyond the realm of education.  His influence extended far beyond the academic sphere, shaping social and legal reform. He was a key figure in the broader social reform movement in Bengal, not just an educational reformer.


**3. With reference to the Eka Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Eka Movement, primarily a peasant uprising in Uttar Pradesh, focused its protests against excessive land revenue demands and the oppressive practices of moneylenders.
2. The Eka Movement, though initially successful in certain regions, ultimately saw its momentum diminish due to internal divisions amongst its leadership and effective government suppression.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Eka Movement, predominantly located in the United Provinces (present-day Uttar Pradesh), was characterized by widespread peasant unrest.  Its core grievances revolved around exorbitant land revenue demands imposed by the colonial administration and the exploitative practices of moneylenders and landlords. The movement demonstrated the growing agrarian discontent across various regions of India.  Its focus on economic issues reflects a key aspect of the socio-political landscape of the time.

Statement 2 is also correct. Although the Eka Movement achieved some initial success in mobilizing peasant communities and challenging the existing power structures, its progress was ultimately hampered by internal factionalism amongst its leaders. This internal weakness, coupled with a concerted effort by the British government to suppress the movement through various measures, led to its eventual decline. The movement’s trajectory highlights the challenges faced by localized peasant uprisings in the face of both internal and external pressures.  It demonstrates the complex interplay of social, political, and administrative factors that shaped the course of such movements.



**4. With reference to the Tana Bhagat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tana Bhagat Movement, largely a tribal movement in present-day Jharkhand, was characterized by its syncretic religious beliefs, blending elements of Hinduism and Christianity.
2. Jatra Oraon, a key figure in the Tana Bhagat Movement, actively advocated for the adoption of satyagraha as a method of non-violent resistance against the exploitative practices of moneylenders and zamindars.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tana Bhagat Movement, which originated in the Chotanagpur region (present-day Jharkhand), exhibited a unique blend of religious beliefs. Its followers incorporated elements from both Hinduism and Christianity, reflecting the syncretic nature of religious practices in many tribal communities. This religious fusion was a central aspect of the movement’s identity and provided a framework for its social and political objectives.  The movement's syncretic nature is a significant feature of its socio-religious context.

Statement 2 is also correct. Jatra Oraon, a prominent leader of the Tana Bhagat Movement, played a crucial role in shaping its strategies and goals. He advocated for non-violent resistance, drawing inspiration from the principles of satyagraha popularized by Mahatma Gandhi. This approach to resistance was a significant aspect of the movement's strategy in challenging the oppressive practices of moneylenders and zamindars. The adoption of satyagraha demonstrates the influence of broader nationalist ideologies on localized tribal movements.



**5. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, primarily aimed at reforming Hindu society by advocating a return to the Vedic scriptures as the ultimate source of authority.
2. The Arya Samaj actively supported inter-caste marriages and widow remarriages, challenging traditional Hindu social norms.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Arya Samaj, established by Swami Dayananda Saraswati, emphasized a return to what it considered the original, pure principles of the Vedic scriptures.  It rejected many later accretions to Hindu religious practice and philosophy that it viewed as corrupting influences. This emphasis on Vedic authority formed the core of its reformist ideology. The movement's focus on Vedic scriptures is a crucial aspect of understanding its theological and social objectives.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Arya Samaj actively challenged many traditional Hindu social practices that it considered to be contrary to the Vedic ideals.  It actively championed social reforms such as inter-caste marriages and widow remarriages, which were highly controversial at the time, thereby challenging the rigid caste system and patriarchal norms within Hindu society. These actions demonstrate the movement's commitment to social justice and equality.  Its advocacy for these reforms is a significant aspect of its broader socio-political impact.


**6. With reference to the Ramakrishna Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramakrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda, focused primarily on religious and spiritual reform, with little emphasis on social service or community development initiatives.
2.  The Ramakrishna Mission, while rooted in Vedanta philosophy, expanded its activities beyond purely religious pursuits to encompass a wide range of social service programs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Ramakrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda, certainly had a strong spiritual and philosophical foundation rooted in Vedanta, its activities extended far beyond purely religious or spiritual matters.  The Mission established numerous educational institutions, hospitals, and other social service organizations dedicated to improving the lives of people from all backgrounds.  The Mission's commitment to social service is a fundamental aspect of its legacy and its contribution to Indian society.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ramakrishna Mission’s work clearly demonstrates its engagement in social service and community development.  While its philosophy is based on Vedanta,  its practical application involves a broad spectrum of social welfare activities. This demonstrates the practical application of its philosophical principles in addressing the social needs of the time. The Mission's approach highlights the intersection of religious ideals and social action in the late 19th and 20th centuries.


**7. With reference to the social reform movements of 19th and 20th century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Most of the 19th and 20th century social reform movements were primarily driven by the concerns of the upper castes, with limited engagement with the issues of the lower castes and marginalized communities.
2.  The social reform movements of 19th and 20th century India, while diverse in their approaches, shared a common thread of advocating for rationalism, humanism, and the upliftment of the marginalized.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many prominent figures in the social reform movements came from the upper castes, it is inaccurate to characterize the movements as solely driven by their concerns.  Many movements actively addressed the concerns of lower castes and marginalized communities, striving for social justice and equality.  Figures like Jyotiba Phule and B.R. Ambedkar dedicated their lives to challenging caste discrimination and advocating for the rights of the oppressed.  The movements' engagement with the concerns of the marginalized is a crucial aspect of their historical significance.

Statement 2 is correct.  Despite their diversity in approaches and specific objectives, the social reform movements of 19th and 20th century India shared a common underlying philosophy.  They broadly advocated for rationalism, humanism, and the betterment of the marginalized sections of society. This shared commitment to progressive values is a key factor in understanding the movements' overall impact. The emphasis on rationalism and humanism reflects the influence of modern Western thought on Indian social thought.


**8. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's ideology and actions, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahatma Gandhi's advocacy for non-violence (ahimsa) and satyagraha was primarily focused on achieving political independence, with limited attention given to social reform and issues of caste.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy extended beyond political independence to encompass a vision of social justice, including the eradication of untouchability and the empowerment of women.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi's primary focus was undeniably on achieving India's independence from British rule, his philosophy of non-violence and satyagraha was intricately linked to his broader vision of social justice and reform.  He actively campaigned against untouchability, advocating for the upliftment of Dalits, and championed women's rights and education.  His approach to social reform was integral to his political strategy.  The interconnectedness of his political and social goals is essential to understanding his overall philosophy.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gandhi's philosophy was holistic, encompassing both political and social dimensions. His commitment to social justice extended to various issues, including the eradication of untouchability, the empowerment of women, and the promotion of communal harmony. His advocacy for these causes demonstrates the depth and breadth of his commitment to creating a just and equitable society.  His social reform ideas are an essential part of his lasting legacy.


**9. With reference to Jyotiba Phule's contributions to social reform, consider the following statements:**

1. Jyotiba Phule's primary focus was on religious reform, advocating for a complete rejection of traditional Hindu beliefs and practices in favor of a more rational and modern faith.
2. Jyotiba Phule, a key figure in the social reform movement in Maharashtra, actively challenged the caste system, advocating for education and social upliftment of lower castes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Jyotiba Phule was critical of certain aspects of traditional Hindu beliefs and practices, his primary focus was not on religious reform in the sense of advocating for a new faith. His critique was primarily directed at the social inequalities embedded within the existing religious system. His work was largely concerned with social reform and challenging the caste system. His focus remained on social justice rather than religious restructuring.

Statement 2 is correct.  Jyotiba Phule is recognized as a pivotal figure in the social reform movement in Maharashtra. He relentlessly challenged the caste system, advocating for the education and social upliftment of lower castes and marginalized communities.  He founded schools for girls and actively worked to improve the social and economic conditions of the oppressed.  His commitment to social justice and equality is a significant aspect of his legacy.  His work represents a major contribution to the social reform movement in Maharashtra.


**10. With reference to the impact of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The Revolt of 1857 primarily involved sepoys (Indian soldiers in the British East India Company's army), with limited participation from other segments of Indian society.
2. The Revolt of 1857, while ultimately unsuccessful in overthrowing British rule, significantly impacted the course of Indian history, leading to profound changes in the British administration and the rise of new forms of Indian nationalism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Revolt of 1857 began with a mutiny of sepoys, its scope quickly expanded to encompass a wide range of participants, including peasants, artisans, and various social groups.  The rebellion was a multifaceted uprising with diverse motivations and participants.  The broad-based nature of the revolt is a key aspect of its historical significance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Revolt of 1857, though ultimately unsuccessful in its immediate aim of overthrowing British rule, had a profound and lasting impact on Indian history.  It forced the British to re-evaluate their administrative policies, leading to significant reforms. Furthermore, the rebellion served as a catalyst for the rise of new forms of Indian nationalism, shaping the subsequent trajectory of the Indian independence movement. The revolt's long-term consequences are crucial to understanding the development of Indian nationalism.

**1. With reference to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was instrumental in opening Sanskrit College to non-Brahmin students, significantly expanding access to higher education.
2.  Vidyasagar's reform efforts primarily focused on advocating for Western thought, minimizing his engagement with traditional Indian social structures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a crucial role in reforming the Sanskrit College, making it accessible to students from all castes, not just Brahmins. This was a significant step towards social reform and educational equality.  His efforts challenged the rigid caste system prevalent in 19th-century India and promoted a more inclusive approach to education. This action directly impacted the social landscape and contributed to broader social reform movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Vidyasagar did introduce elements of Western thought into his educational reforms and advocated for social change, his work was deeply rooted in and engaged with the existing social fabric of India. His reforms were not solely focused on Western ideas but aimed at a synthesis of progressive Western ideals and the betterment of Indian society within its own context. He worked extensively on issues like widow remarriage and women's education, demonstrating a deep understanding and engagement with traditional social structures and their reform. His approach was not to replace Indian traditions but to reform them from within.  His efforts demonstrate a nuanced approach, combining elements of both Western and traditional Indian thought.


**2. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revolt at Allahabad was primarily led by Nana Saheb, who, after expelling the British, proclaimed himself Peshwa.
2.  Azimullah, a key figure in the 1857 uprising, was primarily known for his military prowess and strategic battlefield command.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nana Saheb was a prominent leader of the 1857 Revolt, particularly in Kanpur, the leadership of the uprising in Allahabad was primarily held by Maulvi Liyaqat Ali. Nana Saheb's actions were concentrated in Kanpur, where he expelled the British and briefly assumed the title of Peshwa.  Attributing the Allahabad leadership to him is a misrepresentation of the historical record.  The revolt's leadership varied across different regions, reflecting the decentralized nature of the uprising.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Azimullah, while a significant figure in the 1857 Revolt, was primarily known for his expertise in political propaganda and his ability to mobilize support rather than his military leadership. He served as a key advisor and strategist for Nana Saheb, leveraging his skills in communication and persuasion to rally support for the rebellion. His contributions were crucial in shaping public opinion and coordinating the revolt's efforts, but his role was primarily political, not military.  Confusing his political influence with military command is a common misconception.



**3. With reference to the early Nationalist Movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalist movement's primary method was constitutional agitation, focusing on petitions and peaceful appeals to the British government.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent Moderate leader, unequivocally advocated for complete independence ("Purna Swaraj") from British rule during this period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), often termed the "Moderate" phase, primarily employed methods of constitutional agitation.  Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Ferozeshah Mehta focused on building public opinion through petitions, public meetings, and reasoned appeals to the British government for reforms within the existing political framework.  Their strategy emphasized working within the system to gradually achieve self-rule, not immediate independence.  This approach contrasted with the later "Extremist" phase, which adopted more radical and assertive methods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Dadabhai Naoroji was a staunch critic of British rule and a powerful advocate for Indian self-governance, he did not explicitly call for complete independence ("Purna Swaraj") during the early Moderate phase. His focus was on securing greater autonomy and self-rule within the British Empire through constitutional means.  The demand for complete independence emerged later, primarily during the Extremist phase of the nationalist movement.  Attributing the demand for Purna Swaraj to him during the early phase is anachronistic.


**4.  With reference to the Santhal Hool of 1855, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Santhal Hool was characterized by a complete and sustained Santhal victory over British forces throughout the conflict.
2.  Gokko's leadership played a significant role in the Santhal Hool, particularly in the Godda region.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Hool, while a significant rebellion, did not result in a complete Santhal victory.  While the Santhals initially achieved some successes and inflicted losses on British forces, the rebellion was ultimately suppressed by the British. The British eventually regained control through military action, highlighting the limitations of the Santhal uprising despite its initial strength and impact.  The rebellion's outcome underscores the imbalance of power between the Santhals and the British colonial forces.

Statement 2 is correct. Gokko was indeed a key leader of the Santhal Hool, particularly active in the Godda region.  His leadership played a crucial role in organizing and mobilizing the Santhal community against British rule.  His contributions highlight the importance of local leadership in shaping the course of the rebellion.  While the Hool involved multiple leaders, Gokko's role in Godda is well-documented in historical accounts of the event.


**5. Consider the following statements about social reformers:**

1. Raja Ram Mohan Roy is primarily known for his proficiency in Sanskrit, which he utilized to promote social reform.
2. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's advocacy for widow remarriage significantly contributed to its legalization in British India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a highly educated and influential social reformer, his expertise lay primarily in Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit, but his impact on social reform stemmed more from his advocacy for monotheism and his critique of social practices, rather than his direct use of Sanskrit for social reform. His writings and actions challenged traditional norms but did not primarily utilize Sanskrit to achieve this.  His influence was multi-faceted, engaging religious, social and political spheres.

Statement 2 is correct. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a leading figure in the campaign for widow remarriage in 19th-century India. His advocacy, combined with the efforts of other reformers and legal changes, significantly contributed to the legalization of widow remarriage in British India. His relentless work on this issue made a substantial impact on the legal and social landscape of the time and significantly improved the status of widows.  This reform was a landmark achievement in social reform efforts.


**6. With reference to the early twentieth-century nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The call for passive resistance, in addition to Swadeshi and Boycott, was primarily championed by moderate nationalists.
2. Aurobindo Ghose explicitly advocated for the complete independence of India during this period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The call for passive resistance, alongside Swadeshi and Boycott, was a key strategy of the militant nationalists, not the moderates.  While moderates focused on constitutional methods, the extremists, including figures like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Aurobindo Ghose, recognized the need for more assertive methods to challenge British rule.  Passive resistance, involving non-cooperation and civil disobedience, was a crucial component of their strategy.  This reflects a shift towards more radical approaches to achieving self-rule.

Statement 2 is correct. Aurobindo Ghose, a prominent figure in the early 20th-century nationalist movement, openly advocated for complete independence for India. His writings and speeches clearly articulated the goal of full self-rule, significantly influencing the trajectory of the nationalist movement.  His articulation of the need for political freedom as the lifeblood of a nation demonstrates his commitment to complete independence.  He was a vocal critic of British rule and a champion of Indian self-determination.


**7. With reference to the revolutionary terrorist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association, later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, primarily focused on assassinating high-ranking British officials.
2. Bhagat Singh's actions were primarily motivated by a desire for complete social equality, leading him to reject all forms of violence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), was a revolutionary organization that engaged in armed struggle against British rule.  Their activities included bombings, assassinations, and other acts of violence aimed at disrupting British authority and mobilizing support for revolution.  While their ideology evolved to incorporate socialist ideals, their initial focus was on armed resistance.  This reflects the frustration with the limitations of non-violent methods.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Bhagat Singh held socialist ideals and advocated for social equality, his actions were not solely motivated by a desire for social reform, nor did he reject violence entirely.  He believed that violent revolution was a necessary means to achieve independence and social justice.  His actions, such as the assassination of a British police officer and the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly, clearly demonstrate his belief in the use of revolutionary violence to achieve his goals. His actions were a response to state violence and a commitment to the revolutionary cause.


**8.  With reference to the Nehru Report (1928), consider the following statements:**

1. The Nehru Report advocated for dominion status as the next immediate step towards Indian self-government.
2. The Nehru Report was unanimously accepted by all participating Indian political parties and groups, paving the way for a unified constitutional approach.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nehru Report, drafted by a committee headed by Motilal Nehru, proposed dominion status as the next immediate step in India's journey towards self-government. This represented a significant step towards greater autonomy within the British Empire, although it fell short of demanding complete independence.  This proposal reflects a pragmatic approach to achieving self-rule within a defined timeframe.  The report addressed various aspects of constitutional reform.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nehru Report, despite its significant contributions, was not unanimously accepted by all Indian political parties and groups.  Communal organizations, such as the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha, raised objections based on their differing interests and priorities, leading to divisions within the nationalist movement.  The failure to achieve consensus on the Nehru Report highlights the challenges posed by communal politics and the difficulty of forging a unified national approach to constitutional reform.  This failure underscores the complexities of the political landscape during that era.


**9. With reference to the Simon Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Simon Commission's composition, consisting entirely of British members, led to widespread protests and a nationwide boycott in India.
2. The Muslim League unequivocally opposed the boycott of the Simon Commission, advocating for cooperation with the British government.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Simon Commission, appointed by the British government in 1927 to examine India's constitutional future, consisted entirely of British members, sparking widespread outrage and protests across India. The exclusion of any Indian members was seen as a deliberate insult and a disregard for India's aspirations for self-governance. This led to a massive and unified boycott of the Commission by major Indian political parties, including the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Hindu Mahasabha.  The boycott demonstrated a unified Indian response to British actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Muslim League, initially hesitant, eventually joined the nationwide boycott of the Simon Commission.  While there were internal divisions within the League, the dominant sentiment was one of opposition to the Commission's composition and the perceived insult to Indian self-respect.  The League's participation in the boycott underscores the shared sentiment of opposition to the British government's actions and the unified nature of the Indian response. The boycott was a landmark event in the Indian freedom struggle.


**10. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governing powers to provinces in British India.
2. The Act established a system of separate electorates for Muslims and other minority communities, ensuring their representation in the legislature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced a significant element of provincial autonomy, granting considerable self-governing powers to the provinces.  This marked a substantial shift towards greater Indian participation in governance, although ultimate authority still resided with the British government.  The Act's introduction of provincial autonomy was a milestone in the process of transferring power.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act also established a system of separate electorates for Muslims and other minority communities, aiming to ensure their representation in the legislatures. This provision, however, was a controversial aspect of the Act, as it reinforced communal divisions and contributed to the growth of separatist sentiments.  The separate electorate provision was a major point of contention and played a role in the partition of India.  The Act's complexities reflect the intricate political environment.

**1. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The immediate trigger for the revolt was the introduction of the Enfield rifle, whose cartridges were greased with animal fat, considered sacrilegious by both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.
2.  The revolt was primarily a spontaneous uprising with minimal pre-planning, lacking a unified nationalistic ideology or a clearly defined leadership structure across all participating regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While underlying economic, political, and social grievances fueled the 1857 Revolt, the immediate trigger was indeed the controversial greased cartridges. The use of animal fat (beef and pork) in the cartridges deeply offended both Hindu and Muslim sepoys, who saw it as a deliberate attempt to defile their religious beliefs. This sparked widespread mutiny within the British Indian Army, which quickly escalated into a larger rebellion.  The outrage over the cartridges served as the catalyst that ignited the simmering discontent and brought the various grievances to a head.

Statement 2 is also largely correct. While some historians argue for a degree of pre-planning and coordination, the 1857 Revolt lacked the centralized organization and unified nationalistic ideology of later freedom struggles.  The rebellion erupted in various regions with different leaders and motivations, often driven by local grievances and existing power dynamics. The participation of diverse groups, from sepoys to peasants and princes, further contributed to the decentralized and fragmented nature of the movement. Although Bahadur Shah Zafar became a symbolic figurehead, his leadership was weak and ineffective in unifying the disparate rebel forces across vast geographical areas.  The lack of a cohesive strategy and overarching goal ultimately contributed to the revolt's failure.  The absence of a singular, pan-Indian nationalist objective distinguishes it from later, more organized movements for independence.


**2. With reference to the economic causes of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British implemented policies that led to the destruction of traditional Indian industries, such as handloom weaving, resulting in widespread unemployment and poverty among artisans.
2.  The British revenue system, particularly the Permanent Settlement, benefited the peasantry by ensuring fair land ownership and preventing exploitative practices by landlords.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. British economic policies significantly damaged traditional Indian industries.  The influx of cheaper British manufactured goods, coupled with high export duties on Indian products, devastated local industries like handloom weaving and textile production. This resulted in massive unemployment, impoverishing vast segments of the artisan class. The loss of livelihoods and economic hardship contributed significantly to the widespread discontent that fueled the 1857 Revolt.  The destruction of traditional Indian industries created widespread economic hardship and resentment, fueling the rebellion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement, while intended to stabilize land revenue, had detrimental effects on the peasantry.  It solidified the power of zamindars, who often exploited the peasants through high rents and oppressive practices.  The system did little to protect the peasantry and often led to their displacement and impoverishment.  The Permanent Settlement, far from benefiting the peasantry, entrenched the power of the zamindars, leading to exploitation of the rural population.  This contributed to the widespread agrarian unrest that played a role in the 1857 Revolt.


**3. With reference to the leaders of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, known for her military prowess and unwavering resistance, led the revolt in Awadh.
2.  Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the Peshwa, played a significant role in the revolt at Kanpur, initially offering safe passage to British soldiers before subsequently massacring them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rani Lakshmibai was a crucial leader of the 1857 Revolt, she led the rebellion in Jhansi, not Awadh.  The revolt in Awadh was primarily led by Begum Hazrat Mahal.  Confusing the regions of Rani Lakshmibai's and Begum Hazrat Mahal's leadership is a common error.

Statement 2 is correct. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, played a prominent role in the revolt at Kanpur.  He initially agreed to grant safe passage to British soldiers who surrendered, but later, in a controversial and widely condemned act, ordered their massacre. This event significantly escalated the violence and brutality of the conflict. The betrayal and subsequent massacre at Kanpur remain a controversial and significant aspect of the revolt.


**4. With reference to the aftermath of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British Crown directly assumed control of India, abolishing the rule of the East India Company, and implemented significant reforms aimed at improving the governance and administration of the country.
2.  The revolt led to a significant increase in the number of Indian sepoys in the British Indian Army, reflecting a renewed trust in Indian loyalty and a shift towards a more inclusive military structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 1857 Revolt prompted significant changes in British governance in India.  The British Crown formally assumed control from the East India Company, marking the end of Company rule.  The Government of India Act 1858 formalized this transfer of power. While some administrative reforms were introduced, they were primarily aimed at strengthening British control, not necessarily at improving governance for Indians. The reforms were implemented to consolidate British power and prevent future uprisings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1857 Revolt severely eroded British trust in Indian sepoys.  Rather than increasing their numbers, the British drastically reduced the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army and implemented a policy of "divide and rule," recruiting soldiers from different regions and communities to prevent future large-scale mutinies. The British response was to restructure the army, significantly reducing the number of Indian sepoys and increasing the proportion of British troops. This reflected a deep distrust of Indian soldiers following the revolt.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the nature and interpretation of the 1857 Revolt:**

1.  Some historians characterize the revolt as a "sepoy mutiny," focusing primarily on the military aspects and downplaying the widespread civilian participation.
2.  V.D. Savarkar's interpretation of the revolt as a "first war of independence" is universally accepted by historians as an accurate and complete representation of the event.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 1857 Revolt has been interpreted differently by various historians.  Some, particularly early British historians, viewed it primarily as a "sepoy mutiny," emphasizing the initial involvement of the Indian sepoys and downplaying the substantial participation of the civilian population. This narrow interpretation often ignored the broader socio-economic and political factors that contributed to the rebellion.  The "sepoy mutiny" interpretation is a limited perspective that fails to capture the wide-ranging participation of civilians in the revolt.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  V.D. Savarkar's interpretation of the 1857 Revolt as the "first war of independence" is a significant but contested perspective. While acknowledging the nationalist elements and the widespread anti-British sentiment, many historians argue that the revolt lacked the organized, pan-Indian character and unified nationalistic ideology to be accurately described as a "war of independence" in the modern sense. The revolt was a complex event with diverse motivations and limited geographical reach, making Savarkar's interpretation a subject of ongoing historical debate.  The lack of a unified nationalistic vision and leadership across the affected regions makes the term "war of independence" historically debatable.

**1. With reference to the Bardoli Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bardoli Satyagraha primarily focused on protesting against the enhancement of land revenue imposed by the British government in the Bardoli taluka of Gujarat.
2.  K.M. Munshi, a prominent lawyer and later a leading figure in Indian politics, played a significant role in organizing and leading the Bardoli Satyagraha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bardoli Satyagraha, a landmark event in India's struggle for independence, was primarily a protest against a substantial increase in land revenue imposed by the British government in the Bardoli taluka of Surat district, Gujarat.  The exorbitant tax burden threatened the livelihood of the peasant community, triggering widespread discontent and leading to the Satyagraha. The success of the Bardoli Satyagraha significantly boosted the morale of the Indian freedom struggle and demonstrated the power of non-violent resistance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While K.M. Munshi was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement and played significant roles in various political and social initiatives, he was not the primary organizer or leader of the Bardoli Satyagraha.  The leadership of the Satyagraha rested primarily with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, whose exceptional organizational skills and strategic acumen were instrumental in its success.  Munshi's contributions, while valuable, were supportive in nature rather than central to the movement's leadership.  His involvement might have been in providing legal counsel or other forms of support, but he wasn't at the forefront of the agitation as the leader.


**2. With reference to the Santhal Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Santhal Revolt, primarily led by religious figures, was a significant rebellion against the British East India Company's policies of land acquisition and taxation in the Santhal Parganas region.
2.  The revolt was largely confined to the Santhal Parganas and did not significantly impact other parts of Bengal or Bihar.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Santhal Revolt was indeed a significant rebellion against the British East India Company’s exploitative policies, the leadership wasn't primarily religious.  The revolt was led by tribal leaders like Sidhu Murmu and Kanhu Murmu, who mobilized the Santhal community against the injustices they faced due to land alienation and oppressive taxation. Although religious beliefs and sentiments might have played a role in motivating the rebels, the leadership was distinctly secular and focused on the immediate grievances of the Santhal people.

Statement 2 is correct. Although the Santhal Revolt originated and was most intensely fought in the Santhal Parganas region, its impact remained largely localized.  While it demonstrated the potential for tribal resistance against British rule, the revolt did not spread widely to other parts of Bengal or Bihar, unlike some other major uprisings of the period. The British effectively contained the rebellion within the Santhal Parganas, preventing its escalation into a broader, widespread movement.


**3. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Jyotiba Phule, a prominent social reformer from Maharashtra, authored the influential work "Gulamgiri," which vehemently criticized the caste system and advocated for social justice for the marginalized communities.
2.  The Servants of India Society, founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, was primarily focused on promoting Western-style parliamentary politics and remained aloof from the broader Indian nationalist movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jyotirao Phule, a pioneering social reformer from Maharashtra, is indeed the author of "Gulamgiri" ("Slavery"). This powerful work is a scathing critique of the caste system and the social injustices inflicted upon the lower castes in India.  Phule's advocacy for social justice and his relentless fight against caste-based discrimination are well-documented and make him a significant figure in the history of social reform in India.  "Gulamgiri" remains a relevant text even today, highlighting the continuing struggle for social equality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Servants of India Society, established by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, was not solely focused on Western-style parliamentary politics or detached from the broader nationalist movement.  While Gokhale was a moderate leader who believed in constitutional methods, the Society actively worked towards social and political reforms within the context of the Indian nationalist struggle.  It aimed to improve the conditions of the Indian people and promote self-governance through gradual, constitutional means.  The Society's activities encompassed a wide range of social and political reforms, demonstrating its integral role within the evolving Indian nationalist movement.


**4. With reference to Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda's participation in the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 significantly enhanced the global understanding and appreciation of Hindu philosophy and spirituality.
2.  Swami Vivekananda, a staunch critic of all forms of religious reform, advocated for a rigid adherence to traditional Hindu practices and vehemently opposed any attempts at modernization or adaptation of religious beliefs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's address at the 1893 World Parliament of Religions in Chicago was a watershed moment in the global perception of Hinduism. His powerful and eloquent speeches presented Hinduism in a positive and accessible light, dispelling many misconceptions and highlighting its universal message of tolerance and spiritual unity.  This event significantly contributed to the spread of Vedanta philosophy and yoga throughout the world, enhancing the global appreciation of Hindu spiritual traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Swami Vivekananda was not a staunch critic of all religious reforms, nor did he advocate for rigid adherence to traditional practices.  While deeply rooted in Hindu traditions, he was a proponent of adapting and interpreting religious beliefs in a way that resonated with modern sensibilities.  He emphasized the importance of social service and practical application of spiritual principles, advocating for a more inclusive and dynamic understanding of Hinduism, actively engaging with contemporary issues and seeking to bridge the gap between spirituality and social action.  He believed in reforming Hinduism to make it more relevant and accessible to the masses.


**5. With reference to the Brahmo Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Brahmo Samaj, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, primarily focused on advocating for social reforms like widow remarriage and opposed practices like Sati, but did not engage with political issues or the broader Indian nationalist movement.
2.  Debendranath Tagore, the son of Dwarkanath Tagore, succeeded Raja Ram Mohan Roy as the leader of the Brahmo Samaj and further expanded its social reform agenda, including advocating for women's education.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Raja Ram Mohan Roy founded the Brahmo Samaj, and it did indeed champion social reforms such as widow remarriage and the abolition of Sati, the Brahmo Samaj's influence extended beyond social reform. The movement significantly impacted the intellectual and spiritual landscape of 19th-century India, and its members actively participated in discussions about social and political issues, contributing to the broader development of Indian nationalism.  It was a significant precursor to the more overtly political movements that followed.

Statement 2 is correct. Debendranath Tagore, son of Dwarkanath Tagore, did indeed succeed Raja Ram Mohan Roy in leading the Brahmo Samaj.  He further developed the movement's social reform agenda, particularly in the area of women's education, contributing to the growth of progressive ideas within the religious and social sphere of 19th-century India.  His leadership marked a significant phase in the evolution of the Brahmo Samaj.

**1. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The immediate trigger for the revolt was the introduction of the Enfield rifle, whose cartridges were greased with animal fat, considered sacrilegious by both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.
2.  The revolt was entirely a spontaneous uprising, lacking any pre-planning or organized conspiracy among the sepoys and civilian population.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The greased cartridges of the Enfield rifle served as the immediate trigger for the widespread mutiny among sepoys.  The rumour that the grease was composed of beef and pork fat deeply offended both Hindu and Muslim religious sensibilities, igniting widespread discontent within the ranks of the British Indian Army. This religious outrage provided the crucial spark that ignited the pre-existing discontent, leading to the initial outbreak of the revolt.  While other underlying causes existed, the cartridge controversy acted as the catalyst for open rebellion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the extent of pre-planning remains a subject of historical debate, evidence suggests that the revolt wasn't entirely spontaneous.  The circulation of chapattis and rumors, along with the activities of wandering sanyasis and faqirs, indicate some level of prior communication and coordination among various groups. Although a fully centralized and comprehensive conspiracy is not definitively proven, the simultaneous uprisings in multiple locations suggest a degree of pre-planning and communication beyond mere coincidence. The revolt's rapid spread across North India also points to the existence of pre-existing networks of communication and discontent that facilitated the swift escalation of the mutiny into a widespread rebellion.


**2. With reference to the leaders of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rani Lakshmibai's participation stemmed primarily from her personal grievance over the annexation of Jhansi and the denial of her adopted son's succession rights.
2.  Kunwar Singh, despite his advanced age, was a key military strategist and organizer of the revolt, primarily focusing his efforts in Bihar.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Revolt of 1857 had broader socio-political causes, Rani Lakshmibai's participation was deeply personal. The British annexation of Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse, coupled with the refusal to acknowledge her adopted son's claim to the throne, fueled her fierce resistance.  Her personal grievance became intertwined with the larger rebellion, making her a powerful symbol of defiance against British policies and the injustices faced by Indian rulers. Her actions were directly motivated by the British's actions against her kingdom and her family.

Statement 2 is also correct. Kunwar Singh, despite his age of nearly 80, played a crucial role in organizing and leading the revolt in Bihar.  He was a skilled military leader and strategist, effectively mobilizing local forces and engaging in successful battles against the British. His participation exemplifies the broader involvement of zamindars and local elites in the rebellion, highlighting the diverse nature of the movement's leadership and the deep-seated resentment against British rule at various levels of society.  His actions demonstrate the revolt's spread beyond just sepoy mutinies into a wider rebellion involving local power structures.


**3. With reference to the aftermath of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The British government's response involved the complete disbandment of the British Indian Army and its replacement with a solely European force.
2.  The Queen's Proclamation of 1858 promised religious tolerance and equal treatment under the law for all Indian subjects.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The British response to the 1857 Revolt did involve significant changes to the army, drastically reducing the proportion of Indian sepoys and increasing the number of British troops. However, it did not result in the complete disbandment of the Indian army.  The British reorganized the army, creating a new structure that sought to minimize the risk of future mutinies by incorporating measures like the recruitment of soldiers from "martial races" considered more loyal and the separation of units to prevent large-scale coordinated uprisings. The British Indian Army continued to exist, albeit with significant changes in its composition and structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Queen's Proclamation of 1858, issued after the suppression of the revolt, aimed to reassure the Indian population. A key component of this reassurance was the promise of religious tolerance and non-interference in religious matters. It also pledged equal treatment under the law, though this promise was not always consistently implemented in practice. The proclamation aimed to rebuild trust and restore a sense of stability after the upheaval of the rebellion.  However, the proclamation's promises of equality and non-interference were not always fully realised in the years that followed.



**4.  With reference to the socio-religious context of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The activities of Christian missionaries played a significant role in fueling anti-British sentiment among the Indian population.
2.  The revolt demonstrated a complete absence of Hindu-Muslim unity, with religious differences overshadowing any shared opposition to British rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The missionary activities of the British in India, often perceived as attempts to convert Indians to Christianity, contributed to the existing religious anxieties and suspicions toward British rule.  This religious dimension played a role in shaping anti-British sentiment, and fears of religious persecution were instrumental in inciting unrest among certain segments of the population. The actions of Christian missionaries added to the prevailing sense of cultural and religious threat posed by British rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Revolt of 1857, despite its complex and diverse nature, showed significant instances of Hindu-Muslim unity.  Both Hindu and Muslim sepoys participated in the revolt, united by their shared grievances against British rule.  Many leaders were from both religious communities and the recognition of Bahadur Shah Zafar, a Muslim, as the symbolic head of the rebellion further highlights this cooperation. While religious differences certainly existed within Indian society, the revolt demonstrated that shared political grievances could temporarily override these differences, at least in certain regions and for periods of time.  The cooperation between Hindus and Muslims was a significant factor contributing to the rebellion's initial success.


**5. With reference to the geographic spread of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The revolt was primarily confined to the northern and central regions of India, with minimal impact on the southern and western parts of the country.
2.  The revolt's intensity was uniform across all participating regions, with similar levels of participation and success.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Revolt of 1857 was largely concentrated in northern and central India, encompassing regions like Awadh, Delhi, and parts of Bihar. The southern and western regions remained largely unaffected, reflecting the varying levels of British control and the diverse nature of local resistance movements.  The geographic spread of the revolt was not uniform, with some regions experiencing intense rebellion while others remained largely passive.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The intensity and success of the revolt varied considerably across different regions. While some areas saw widespread participation and initial successes, other regions experienced less intense rebellion or were quickly suppressed by British forces.  The revolt's outcome was highly dependent on local factors, including the strength of British presence, the level of local support for the rebellion, and the effectiveness of the leadership.  The uneven nature of the revolt's spread and its varying success in different regions highlight its decentralized and multifaceted character.


**6. With reference to the economic consequences of British policies leading up to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British revenue policies led to widespread peasant indebtedness and landlessness, particularly in regions like Awadh.
2.  The British promoted the growth of modern industries in India, offsetting the negative impact of their policies on traditional handicrafts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British revenue policies, particularly the implementation of systems like the Permanent Settlement, often resulted in heavy tax burdens on the peasantry.  This led to widespread indebtedness and landlessness, particularly in regions like Awadh, where the dispossession of taluqdars further exacerbated the situation. The economic hardship faced by the peasantry became a major source of discontent and fueled the broader opposition to British rule.  The economic grievances of the peasantry were a significant factor contributing to the widespread rebellion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the British did introduce some aspects of modern industrialization, their policies largely favored the growth of industries in Britain at the expense of Indian industries.  The destruction of traditional handicrafts through competition from British manufactured goods and discriminatory trade policies had a devastating impact on Indian artisans and weavers, without being compensated by the growth of domestic modern industries.  This lopsided economic development caused widespread impoverishment and contributed to social unrest.  The lack of commensurate industrial development to offset the decline of traditional industries exacerbated economic hardship.


**7. With reference to the political leadership of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. Bahadur Shah Zafar, as the Mughal Emperor, provided strong and effective leadership to the revolt, unifying the diverse rebel forces.
2.  Nana Saheb, after expelling the British from Kanpur, declared himself the Peshwa and actively coordinated with other rebel leaders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bahadur Shah Zafar served as a symbolic figurehead for the rebellion, his leadership was weak and ineffective.  His advanced age, indecisiveness, and lack of strong military capabilities prevented him from providing the unified and decisive leadership needed to coordinate the diverse rebel forces.  His largely symbolic role highlighted the decentralized and fragmented nature of the rebellion's leadership.

Statement 2 is correct. Nana Saheb, after successfully expelling the British from Kanpur, declared himself the Peshwa and actively worked to consolidate his position and coordinate with other rebel leaders. Though the coordination among rebel leaders remained limited, Nana Saheb's actions in Kanpur demonstrated a more assertive and proactive leadership style compared to Bahadur Shah Zafar. His actions in Kanpur represented a more focused and effective leadership than that displayed by Bahadur Shah Zafar in Delhi.


**8. With reference to the British response to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The British employed a policy of ruthless suppression, including widespread massacres and destruction of villages, to quell the rebellion.
2. The British government immediately granted significant constitutional reforms to address the underlying causes of the revolt.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British response to the Revolt of 1857 was characterized by brutal suppression.  They employed scorched-earth tactics, destroying villages, massacring civilians, and carrying out public executions without trial to instill fear and crush the rebellion.  The severity of their response underscores the extent of the threat they perceived and their determination to restore control.  The British actions reflected a policy of extreme repression aimed at quelling the rebellion and establishing British dominance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the revolt did lead to significant administrative changes, including the transfer of power from the East India Company to the Crown, it did not result in immediate constitutional reforms aimed at addressing the underlying causes of the revolt. The reforms that followed were primarily aimed at strengthening British control and consolidating their power, rather than addressing the underlying socio-economic and political grievances that had fueled the rebellion.  The reforms introduced were largely aimed at strengthening British control and preventing future uprisings.


**9. With reference to the long-term consequences of the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The revolt strengthened the existing Hindu-Muslim unity and fostered a shared sense of Indian national identity.
2.  The revolt led to the end of the East India Company's rule and the establishment of direct British Crown rule in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the revolt did show instances of Hindu-Muslim unity, it did not permanently strengthen it.  The long-term impact on communal relations was complex and varied, with the seeds of future communal tensions also being sown in the aftermath of the revolt.  The British actively exploited existing religious divisions to further their policy of 'divide and rule.' The revolt's impact on communal relations was complex and not uniformly positive.

Statement 2 is correct. The Revolt of 1857 marked a turning point in British rule in India.  It led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct assumption of power by the British Crown. This shift in governance structure had profound long-term implications for the administration and political landscape of India.  The transfer of power from the Company to the Crown was a direct consequence of the revolt and marked a significant change in the nature of British rule.

**1. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements of 19th century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arya Samaj, while advocating for the reform of Hindu society, strictly adhered to the caste system as ordained in the Vedas.
2.  The Brahmo Samaj's primary focus was on social reform, with religious reform playing a secondary role in its agenda.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, actively challenged the rigidities of the caste system and advocated for social equality,  although it did emphasize the authority of the Vedas.  Its interpretation of the Vedas, however, differed significantly from orthodox interpretations and aimed at a more egalitarian society. The Arya Samaj's efforts to reform Hindu society included promoting widow remarriage and inter-caste marriages, directly contradicting the traditional caste hierarchy.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Brahmo Samaj, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, placed equal emphasis on both religious and social reform.  While aiming to purify Hinduism by rejecting idolatry and polytheism, it also actively campaigned against social evils like sati, child marriage, and the subjugation of women.  The Brahmo Samaj's religious reform directly informed and underpinned its social reform initiatives. The two were inextricably linked in their philosophy and practice.  The movement aimed at a holistic transformation of both the religious and social life of its followers.



**2. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The immediate trigger for the 1857 Revolt was widespread Muslim anger over the British annexation of Awadh.
2. The economic grievances of the peasantry played a negligible role in fueling the widespread rebellion.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the annexation of Awadh in 1856 certainly contributed to the discontent among sepoys (many of whom hailed from Awadh) and fueled the initial spark of the rebellion, it was not the sole or even primary cause of the widespread uprising. The revolt was a culmination of various long-standing grievances related to socio-religious issues, economic exploitation, and political subjugation, involving diverse groups beyond just the sepoys and the population of Awadh.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The economic grievances of the peasantry were a significant factor contributing to the widespread nature of the 1857 revolt.  The British land revenue policies, like the Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari system, and Mahalwari system, led to widespread impoverishment, dispossession, and indebtedness among the peasantry.  This economic hardship fueled resentment and contributed to their participation in the rebellion. The revolt wasn't solely a military mutiny; it involved substantial participation from the rural population who were deeply affected by the economic policies of the British.



**3. With reference to the contributions of social reformers in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a crucial role in the passage of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856, but his efforts met with immediate and widespread success across all sections of Hindu society.
2. Jyotirao Phule's social reform work primarily focused on the upliftment of the Brahmin community in Maharashtra.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's tireless efforts were instrumental in the passage of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856, the Act's immediate impact was limited.  It faced considerable resistance from orthodox sections of Hindu society, and the practice of widow remarriage remained relatively uncommon for many years.  The act was a landmark achievement, but its social impact was gradual and faced significant opposition.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Jyotirao Phule's social reform work primarily focused on the upliftment of marginalized communities in Maharashtra, particularly the lower castes and the untouchables (Dalits). He actively challenged the caste system and Brahminical dominance, campaigning for social justice and education for all, irrespective of caste.  His focus was on empowering the oppressed, not the already privileged Brahmin community.  His contributions were critical in challenging the existing social hierarchy.


**4. With reference to the impact of British rule on Indian society, consider the following statements:**

1. The British consistently supported socio-religious reform movements throughout their rule in India, viewing them as a means to modernize and stabilize the country.
2. The British policy of "divide and rule" primarily involved exploiting existing religious and caste divisions for administrative convenience and to maintain their political dominance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British attitude towards socio-religious reform movements was inconsistent and often opportunistic.  While initially showing some support for certain reformist groups, they later became more cautious and even opposed movements perceived as threatening to their authority or social order. The British approach was pragmatic and driven by their self-interest, rather than a consistent commitment to social reform. Their support was often conditional and depended on how the movements aligned with their political objectives.


Statement 2 is correct. The British policy of "divide and rule" was a deliberate strategy to weaken the collective resistance of the Indian population. They actively exploited existing religious, caste, and regional differences to prevent the emergence of a unified national movement that could challenge their rule.  This policy had long-term consequences that continue to shape India's social and political landscape.  The British skillfully manipulated these existing fault lines to maintain their power.


**5. With reference to the British revenue systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, while aiming for direct revenue collection from cultivators, resulted in significantly lower revenue for the British compared to the Zamindari system.
2. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of northern India, completely eliminated the role of village headmen in revenue collection.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ryotwari system, implemented in parts of Southern India, aimed at direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries like zamindars.  This system, despite its flaws, actually generated significantly *higher* revenue for the British East India Company compared to the Zamindari system in many regions, as there were no intermediaries to share the revenue. While both systems faced issues with overassessment and exploitation of peasants, the Ryotwari system generally proved more efficient for the British in terms of revenue collection.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of northern India, did not completely eliminate the role of village headmen (lambardars).  While revenue was collected from the village as a unit (mahal), the village headmen played a crucial role in facilitating this process. They were responsible for collecting revenue from individual cultivators within their village and remitting it to the British authorities. The headmen's role, although altered under British rule, remained significant in the revenue collection mechanism.  They acted as intermediaries, albeit with less authority than zamindars.

**1. With reference to the impact of the First World War on India, consider the following statements:**

1. The war led to a significant increase in the prices of essential commodities, causing widespread economic hardship.
2.  The war effort resulted in a surge in Indian industrial production, bolstering the national economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The First World War had a devastating impact on the Indian economy.  Increased demand for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices of essential goods, creating severe inflation and widespread economic hardship for the vast majority of the Indian population.  Agricultural production suffered due to the diversion of resources and manpower to the war effort, further exacerbating the economic crisis. This contributed significantly to the growing discontent and anti-British sentiment in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some industries experienced growth due to increased wartime demand for certain goods, this was limited and did not lead to a general bolstering of the Indian economy.  In fact, the war disrupted traditional industries and agricultural practices, causing widespread economic damage.  The war also intensified India's dependence on the British economy, as it became a major supplier of raw materials and a market for British manufactured goods. The overall effect was a weakening of the Indian economy, rather than its strengthening.  This economic vulnerability exacerbated existing social tensions and fueled the nationalist movement.  The war, therefore, ultimately undermined rather than strengthened India's economic independence.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement witnessed widespread participation from peasants, but the industrial working class remained largely uninvolved.
2.  The movement's call for the boycott of foreign goods led to a complete cessation of British imports into India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement saw massive participation from peasants, who were particularly affected by economic hardship and exploitative land revenue policies.  Their involvement highlighted the movement's reach beyond urban elites.  However, the involvement of the industrial working class was more limited, although strikes did occur in certain sectors.  The movement's focus on broader national issues and Gandhi's emphasis on non-violence may have prevented the full mobilization of the industrial working class, which had different and often more immediate concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The movement's boycott of foreign goods significantly reduced British imports, but it did not lead to a complete cessation.  The economic boycott was a key element of the movement, aiming to weaken British economic control over India. However, the impact was uneven across different regions and sectors, with varying levels of success in the boycott effort. Some businesses and consumers continued to rely on British goods, limiting the overall effectiveness of the boycott in completely halting imports.  The government also took measures to mitigate the impact of the boycott, further hindering its complete success.


**3. With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. These reforms introduced a system of separate electorates for Muslims, granting them representation in legislative bodies.
2. The reforms significantly increased the number of directly elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 are significant for introducing separate electorates for Muslims. This was a crucial step in the evolution of Indian politics, although it also had the unintended consequence of reinforcing communal divisions. The separate electorate allowed Muslim communities to elect their representatives separately from the general electorate.  This addressed Muslim concerns about their representation in legislative bodies, particularly in regions where they were a minority, but it also created a separate Muslim political identity, which had profound consequences for Indian politics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Morley-Minto Reforms did increase the number of elected members in legislative councils, the majority were still elected indirectly. The expansion of elected representation was a limited concession, aimed at appeasing moderate nationalists while maintaining British control.  The indirect election process meant that the real power remained with the British, who could influence the selection of representatives. The reforms were a carefully calculated strategy to co-opt moderate Indian leaders and weaken the growing nationalist movement.


**4. With reference to the activities of militant nationalists in the early 20th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The militant nationalists exclusively focused on passive resistance, rejecting all forms of violence.
2.  The arrest of Bal Gangadhar Tilak significantly weakened the militant nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While passive resistance was a key strategy employed by militant nationalists, their activities were not exclusively non-violent.  The rise of revolutionary terrorism, particularly in Bengal, demonstrates a departure from purely non-violent methods.  Groups like the Anushilan Samiti resorted to violence, including assassinations and bombings, as a means of challenging British rule.  The militant nationalists' approach was a complex mix of strategies, incorporating both passive resistance and violent acts, reflecting the diverse nature of the movement itself.

Statement 2 is correct. The arrest and imprisonment of Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a significant blow to the militant nationalist movement. Tilak was a powerful leader and a unifying figure, his arrest created a vacuum in leadership, weakening the overall movement's organizational strength and coordination. This also allowed the British government to more effectively suppress the movement, as it struggled to maintain momentum and cohesion in the absence of its most prominent leader.  The impact was especially felt in Maharashtra, where Tilak had a strong base of support.  However, the nationalist sentiment, once ignited, could not be easily suppressed.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the causes of the 1857 Revolt:**

1. The economic policies of the British led to widespread poverty and resentment among the peasantry, but the upper classes remained largely unaffected.
2. The introduction of the Enfield rifle, with its allegedly greased cartridges, was a major trigger for the sepoy mutiny.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British economic policies, including land revenue systems and the destruction of traditional industries, caused widespread poverty and hardship among the peasantry. This created a fertile ground for discontent and rebellion. However, it's inaccurate to say that the upper classes remained entirely unaffected.  While some benefited from collaboration with the British, many others—including deposed rulers and those who lost patronage—also suffered economically and politically, contributing to their participation in the revolt. The economic grievances were widespread, affecting various segments of Indian society.

Statement 2 is correct. The introduction of the Enfield rifle, with its cartridges rumored to be greased with animal fat (cow and pig), deeply offended both Hindu and Muslim sepoys. This perceived insult to religious sensibilities acted as a crucial trigger for the sepoy mutiny, which then escalated into a wider revolt. While the greased cartridges were a proximate cause, they ignited pre-existing discontent over issues of economic exploitation, political subjugation, and cultural disrespect, transforming a military mutiny into a broader national uprising.  The immediate cause, however, served to unite diverse groups against British rule.


**6. With reference to the impact of Western education on Indian society, consider the following statements:**

1. Western education led to the creation of a new class of Indians who were critical of British rule and played a key role in the nationalist movement.
2. Western education completely replaced traditional Indian systems of education, leading to their decline.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The introduction of Western education in India had a transformative impact, creating a new class of educated Indians. This class, while initially benefiting from employment under the British, increasingly became critical of colonial rule. They used their education and skills to articulate the grievances of the Indian people and to organize and lead the nationalist movement.  The educated class played a vital role in shaping public opinion, disseminating nationalist ideas through the press, and organizing political movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Western education gained prominence, it did not entirely replace traditional Indian systems of education.  Traditional schools and gurukuls continued to exist, although their influence diminished in certain areas.  Moreover, many educated Indians incorporated elements of both Western and traditional knowledge in their lives and work.  The interaction between Western and traditional education was a complex process, with varying degrees of influence in different regions and communities.  Western education did not lead to a total eclipse of traditional learning systems.


**7.  With reference to the Champaran Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Satyagraha primarily focused on addressing the grievances of indigo farmers in Bihar.
2. The Champaran Satyagraha was Mahatma Gandhi's first major campaign of civil disobedience in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha, launched in 1917, directly addressed the plight of indigo farmers in Champaran, Bihar.  These farmers were forced into exploitative contracts by British planters, leading to widespread poverty and distress. Gandhi's intervention in Champaran marked a significant turning point in the Indian freedom struggle, as it demonstrated the effectiveness of satyagraha on a large scale and established Gandhi as a powerful leader.

Statement 2 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha is widely regarded as Gandhi's first major campaign of civil disobedience in India.  While he had engaged in similar activities before, Champaran marked a pivotal moment, signifying the beginning of his large-scale use of satyagraha as a tool for political mobilization and resistance against colonial oppression. It showcased the potential of non-violent mass action to challenge British authority, setting the stage for future campaigns of civil disobedience.  The success of the Champaran Satyagraha profoundly impacted the trajectory of the Indian independence movement.


**8. With reference to the partition of Bengal in 1905, consider the following statements:**

1. The partition was primarily intended to weaken the growing nationalist movement in Bengal by dividing its leadership and resources.
2. The partition was overwhelmingly welcomed by the people of Bengal, leading to widespread celebrations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India at the time, initiated the partition of Bengal in 1905.  A primary aim was to weaken the burgeoning nationalist movement in Bengal.  By dividing the province into two, it was hoped that the nationalist leaders would be divided, their organizational strength reduced and the overall movement's effectiveness diminished. This was a classic example of the British policy of "divide and rule."

Statement 2 is incorrect. The partition of Bengal was met with strong opposition from the people of Bengal, leading to widespread protests and the Swadeshi movement.  While some might have welcomed the partition for administrative or other reasons, the vast majority opposed it due to the perceived threat to Bengali identity and cultural unity.  The partition became a unifying factor for the nationalist movement in Bengal, accelerating its growth and intensifying the struggle against British rule. The opposition to the partition underscored the strength of Bengali nationalism and its resistance to British policies.


**9.  With reference to the role of women in the Indian independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Women's participation in the movement was largely confined to providing support from the home front, with limited involvement in active protests.
2.  The Non-Cooperation Movement saw a significant increase in women's participation in various forms of political action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While women did play a crucial role in supporting the movement from the home front, their participation extended far beyond this.  Women actively participated in various forms of protest, including boycotts, picketing, and even direct confrontation with the authorities.  Their roles were diverse, ranging from organizing local movements to participating in major campaigns of civil disobedience.  However, their contributions have often been underrepresented in historical accounts.

Statement 2 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement witnessed a remarkable surge in women's participation in political activism.  Inspired by Gandhi's leadership and the movement's inclusive approach, women actively engaged in various forms of protest, challenging social norms and defying colonial authority.  This marked a significant shift in their role in the freedom struggle, highlighting their growing political consciousness and their commitment to the cause of independence.  Their participation was a testament to the movement's ability to mobilize a wide cross-section of Indian society.


**10. With reference to the impact of the 1857 Revolt on British policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The revolt led to the immediate transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown.
2.  The revolt resulted in significant changes in British administrative policies, including reforms aimed at improving governance and reducing the alienation of the Indian population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 1857 Revolt had a profound impact on the British administration of India, leading to the dissolution of the East India Company and the transfer of power to the British Crown.  The Crown's assumption of direct control over India was a direct consequence of the perceived failure of the Company's governance and its inability to effectively quell the revolt.  This marked a significant shift in the nature of British rule in India.

Statement 2 is correct.  The revolt spurred significant reforms in British administrative policies. While initially characterized by harsh repression, the British government eventually implemented several reforms aimed at improving governance, reducing existing tensions and addressing some of the underlying causes of the revolt.  These included changes in land revenue policies, judicial reforms, and efforts to improve relations with Indian princes.  However, these reforms were largely aimed at stabilizing British rule rather than granting meaningful self-governance.  The reforms were a response to the revolt, but did not fundamentally alter the colonial structure of power.

**1. With reference to the social reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prarthana Samaj, primarily active in Maharashtra, focused heavily on religious reform, advocating for monotheism and the rejection of Vedic authority.
2. The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, primarily aimed at achieving social transformation by advocating for the complete abolition of the caste system and socio-economic inequalities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prarthana Samaj did advocate for monotheism, its focus was more on social reform than on a radical religious overhaul.  It did not reject Vedic authority but rather sought to reinterpret it in a more progressive light.  The Samaj's emphasis was on practical social issues like widow remarriage, women's education, and the dismantling of the caste system, aligning more with a reformist approach within existing religious frameworks rather than a complete theological revolution.  The emphasis on bhakti also indicates a divergence from a strict rejection of Vedic traditions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, explicitly aimed at social transformation, going beyond mere reform.  Phule challenged the very foundations of the caste system, advocating for the complete eradication of social and economic inequalities inherent in it. His focus was on empowering marginalized communities and achieving a more egalitarian society, a goal that transcended the confines of religious reform.  His writings and actions directly attacked Brahminical dominance and sought structural changes in society rather than merely advocating for modifications within existing religious structures.


**2. With reference to the intellectual and social contributions of Syed Ahmed Khan, consider the following statements:**

1. Syed Ahmed Khan vehemently opposed Western scientific education for Indian Muslims, believing it would undermine their religious identity.
2.  Syed Ahmed Khan's Aligarh Movement primarily focused on promoting a rigid, orthodox interpretation of Islamic tenets, rejecting any reconciliation with modern rationalism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Syed Ahmed Khan was a staunch advocate for Western scientific education for Indian Muslims. He believed that modern education was crucial for their progress and advancement in society, and he founded the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College (later Aligarh Muslim University) to achieve this goal. His aim was to reconcile modern scientific knowledge with Islamic teachings, not to oppose the former.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Syed Ahmed Khan's Aligarh Movement was characterized by a liberal and modern approach to Islam. While he considered the Quran to be the ultimate authority, he advocated for a rational and scientific interpretation of its tenets, seeking to harmonize Islam with modern thought. He actively promoted social reforms like opposing purdah and polygamy, advocating for women's education, and aiming for a more progressive Muslim society, thereby contradicting the statement's assertion of a rigid, orthodox focus.


**3.  Consider the following statements regarding the 1857 Revolt:**

1. The revolt was primarily a result of the immediate trigger of the greased cartridges, with underlying socio-economic grievances playing a minor role.
2. The revolt enjoyed widespread and unified support from all sections of Indian society, including the princely states and the majority of the sepoys.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the greased cartridges served as the immediate trigger for the 1857 Revolt, it is inaccurate to downplay the significant role of underlying socio-economic grievances. The revolt was fueled by decades of British policies that led to widespread economic exploitation, land alienation, and social injustices. These deep-seated resentments among various sections of Indian society, including peasants, artisans, and soldiers, created a fertile ground for widespread rebellion, making the cartridge incident merely a catalyst for a long-simmering discontent.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 1857 Revolt did not enjoy unified support from all sections of Indian society. While it involved significant participation from sepoys, peasants, and some princely states, there was also considerable opposition and varied levels of involvement.  The participation was largely regional and not uniformly spread across all areas of India.  Many princely states remained loyal to the British, and even within the rebellious ranks, unity of purpose and leadership remained a significant challenge, ultimately contributing to the revolt's failure.


**4. With reference to the Brahmo Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1. Keshab Chandra Sen's leadership saw the Brahmo Samaj remain strictly within the confines of Hindu theology, rejecting any influence from other religious traditions.
2.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy's primary aim in founding the Brahmo Samaj was to establish a completely new religion, separate from Hinduism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Under Keshab Chandra Sen's leadership, the Brahmo Samaj embraced a more cosmopolitan approach, incorporating elements from various religious traditions.  Sen's attempts to synthesize different religious beliefs and his more inclusive approach led to internal divisions within the Samaj, but it clearly demonstrates a departure from a strictly Hindu theological framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Raja Ram Mohan Roy's intention in founding the Brahmo Samaj was not to establish a new religion altogether but to reform Hinduism.  His goal was to purify Hinduism by eliminating what he considered to be superstitious practices and to emphasize monotheism and rational principles.  He aimed to revitalize Hinduism from within, not to create a separate religious sect.  His efforts were focused on reforming existing Hindu beliefs and practices, not replacing them entirely.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists primarily employed violent methods of protest and civil disobedience to achieve their political goals.
2.  The Indian National Congress, in its early years, consistently advocated for complete independence from British rule.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early nationalist movement, particularly during the Moderate phase, primarily employed constitutional and non-violent methods of political agitation.  Their strategies involved petitions, public meetings, resolutions, and reasoned arguments to influence British policy.  While some individuals may have held differing views, the dominant approach was one of peaceful and constitutional means of advocating for reform.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian National Congress, in its initial years, did not advocate for complete independence.  The early nationalists, often termed "Moderates," primarily sought self-government within the British Empire, aiming for gradual reforms and greater Indian participation in governance.  The demand for complete independence emerged later, during the rise of the Extremist faction within the Congress.  The early focus was on constitutional means of achieving greater autonomy, not complete separation from British rule.

**1. With reference to the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of Enfield rifles, requiring the use of greased cartridges rumored to be coated with animal fat, was a significant contributing factor to the mutiny.
2.  The policy of annexation, particularly the Doctrine of Lapse, fueled resentment among Indian rulers and contributed to the widespread rebellion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The introduction of the Enfield rifle, with cartridges greased with animal fat (pig and cow), deeply offended both Hindu and Muslim sepoys, who considered it a violation of their religious beliefs. This sparked widespread outrage and played a crucial role in igniting the mutiny.  The rumor, whether true or exaggerated, acted as a potent catalyst, uniting diverse groups of sepoys against the British East India Company.  The perceived religious insult tapped into pre-existing tensions and grievances, accelerating the rebellion.

Statement 2 is also correct. The East India Company's aggressive policy of annexation, especially the Doctrine of Lapse (which led to the annexation of princely states without a male heir), generated considerable resentment among Indian rulers and their subjects.  This policy was seen as unjust and provocative, undermining the legitimacy of the Company's rule and contributing to the widespread discontent that culminated in the 1857 rebellion. The fear of losing their kingdoms and the erosion of their traditional authority further fueled the flames of rebellion.  The annexation policy created a climate of fear and insecurity, pushing many princely states to actively participate in the uprising against the British.


**2. With reference to Mahadev Govind Ranade's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Ranade was a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress and played a crucial role in shaping its early policies.
2.  Ranade founded the Prarthana Samaj in 1870, a socio-religious reform movement aimed at modernizing Hindu society.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahadev Govind Ranade was indeed a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress. He was a key figure in its early years, advocating for moderate and constitutional methods of achieving self-government. His contributions to the Congress included his emphasis on social reform alongside political action, his articulation of a pragmatic approach to nationalist goals, and his role in shaping the organization's strategy and ideology.  He belonged to the moderate faction of the Congress, advocating for gradual and peaceful reforms within the existing political system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ranade was a key figure in the Prarthana Samaj, a socio-religious reform movement, it was not founded by him in 1870.  The Prarthana Samaj was founded in 1867 by a group of reformers, including Atmaram Pandurang.  Ranade joined the movement later and became one of its most influential leaders, contributing significantly to its intellectual and organizational growth.  He championed the cause of social reform, particularly focusing on issues like widow remarriage and education for women.  His association with the Prarthana Samaj demonstrates his commitment to social reform as a necessary component of national progress.


**3. With reference to the Faraizi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Faraizi movement, primarily a religious reform movement, aimed to purify Islam and remove what its followers considered to be corrupt practices within the Muslim community.
2.  The movement was led by Syed Ahmed Barelvi, a prominent figure in the Islamic revivalism of the early 19th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Faraizi movement, initiated by Haji Shariatullah, was primarily a socio-religious reform movement within the Muslim community of Bengal. It aimed to purify Islam by removing practices considered to be un-Islamic or corrupt, such as those related to land ownership and taxation. The movement emphasized a return to the basic tenets of Islam, fostering a sense of religious revivalism and social justice among its followers.  It challenged existing social hierarchies and power structures, advocating for social and economic equality within the Muslim community.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Faraizi movement was not led by Syed Ahmed Barelvi.  While Syed Ahmed Barelvi was a significant figure in the Islamic revivalism of the time, he led a separate movement with distinct goals and strategies.  Haji Shariatullah is widely recognized as the founder of the Faraizi movement, with his son, Dudu Miyan, continuing the movement's legacy.  The Faraizi movement's focus on religious reform and social justice within the Muslim community distinguished it from other contemporary reform and revivalist movements in India. The movement also had a significant impact on the socio-political landscape of Bengal.


**4. With reference to the Indigo Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The rebellion was primarily a peasant revolt against the forced cultivation of indigo by the British planters at exploitative prices.
2. The rebellion was largely confined to the Bengal Presidency and did not spread to other parts of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indigo Rebellion of 1859-60 was a major peasant uprising in Bengal against the British indigo planters. The planters forced the peasants to cultivate indigo, often at exploitative prices and under harsh conditions. This led to widespread discontent and finally erupted into a large-scale rebellion, highlighting the oppressive nature of colonial economic policies and the plight of the Indian peasantry under British rule. The revolt demonstrated the power of collective action by the peasantry and the deep-seated resentment against the exploitative practices of the colonial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Indigo Rebellion was centered in Bengal, it was not entirely confined to that region.  The rebellion's impact and influence extended beyond Bengal, inspiring similar protests and resistance against colonial exploitation in other parts of India. The movement's success in challenging the planters' authority demonstrated the potential for widespread peasant resistance against colonial oppression.  The rebellion's legacy serves as a powerful symbol of peasant struggle and resistance against unjust economic practices.


**5. With reference to the All India Kisan Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Sahajanand Saraswati was elected the first President of the All India Kisan Sabha at its inaugural session in Lucknow in 1936.
2.  The All India Kisan Sabha primarily focused on the issues of land reforms and peasant rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Sahajanand Saraswati was indeed elected the first President of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) at its inaugural session held in Lucknow in 1936.  His leadership played a crucial role in shaping the organization's early development and its focus on peasant rights and land reforms.  His socialist leanings significantly influenced the AIKS's ideology and its approach to addressing the agrarian crisis in India. His role highlights the importance of peasant mobilization and organization in the broader context of the Indian freedom struggle.

Statement 2 is also correct. The All India Kisan Sabha's primary objective was to address the issues faced by Indian peasants, particularly focusing on land reforms and peasant rights. The organization played a significant role in raising awareness about the agrarian crisis, mobilizing peasants, and advocating for land reforms and other measures aimed at improving the socioeconomic conditions of the rural population. Its activities highlight the importance of agrarian issues in the Indian freedom struggle and their connection to broader social and economic inequalities.  The AIKS's legacy continues to be relevant in the context of ongoing land reforms and rural development in India.


**6. With reference to the Prarthana Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1. Atmaram Pandurang was the founder of the Prarthana Samaj.
2.  The Prarthana Samaj primarily focused on social reforms, advocating for issues such as widow remarriage and women's education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Atmaram Pandurang is widely recognized as a founder of the Prarthana Samaj. He played a crucial role in establishing the organization and in shaping its early ideology.  His contributions to the Prarthana Samaj showcase the important role of social reformers in challenging traditional social structures and advocating for progressive change in 19th-century India. His work highlights the intersection of religious reform and social activism during this period.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Prarthana Samaj was a significant socio-religious reform movement in 19th-century India.  It advocated for several social reforms, including widow remarriage, women's education, and the removal of caste-based discrimination.  The movement's efforts demonstrated the growing awareness of social inequalities and the need for progressive social change during this era.  The Prarthana Samaj’s legacy is significant for its contribution to the broader social reform movements in India.  Its focus on social justice and equality continues to resonate in contemporary social activism.  It also illustrates the increasing interaction between religious reform movements and nationalist aspirations.


**7.  With reference to the Theosophical Society, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Theosophical Society was founded by Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Colonel Henry Steel Olcott.
2. The Theosophical Society primarily focused on promoting Western religious and philosophical ideals in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Theosophical Society was indeed founded by Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Colonel Henry Steel Olcott.  Their collaboration led to the establishment of a global organization that aimed to promote a synthesis of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions.  The society's founding represents a significant moment in the history of cross-cultural exchange and religious thought.  The founders' vision was to create a platform for exploring diverse spiritual and philosophical ideas, highlighting the intellectual and spiritual ferment of the late 19th century.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Theosophical Society's primary focus was not on promoting Western ideals in India. Instead, it sought to promote a synthesis of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, emphasizing universal brotherhood and the study of comparative religion and philosophy.  While some of its members may have held Western-centric views, the society's overall aim was to foster a broader understanding of spiritual and philosophical perspectives from around the world.  The society's activities and influence highlight the complex interplay between Western intellectual currents and Indian religious and philosophical traditions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The Theosophical Society's impact on Indian intellectual life was multifaceted and continues to be debated by scholars.


**8. With reference to the Waghera Uprising, consider the following statements:**

1. The Waghera Uprising took place in Baroda in response to the oppressive policies of the Gaekwad ruler.
2.  The uprising was primarily a peasant revolt against high taxes and exploitative land revenue policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Waghera Uprising did indeed take place in Baroda. It was a significant peasant uprising against the oppressive policies of the Gaekwad ruler, highlighting the deep-seated resentment against the exploitative practices of the princely state's administration.  The uprising demonstrated the power of collective peasant action in challenging the authority of even powerful princely rulers.  The event shows the widespread discontent among the peasantry in various parts of India during the colonial period.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Waghera Uprising was primarily a peasant revolt triggered by high taxes and exploitative land revenue policies imposed by the Gaekwad ruler. The uprising underscores the broader issue of agrarian distress and the vulnerability of the peasantry to oppressive revenue systems under both British colonial rule and princely administrations.  The revolt's legacy highlights the importance of addressing agrarian issues in the context of social justice and economic development in India.  The Waghera Uprising, along with other similar uprisings, demonstrates the resilience and agency of Indian peasants in resisting oppressive rule.



**9. With reference to the activities of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, consider the following statements:**

1. Tilak founded the newspaper "Kesari" which played a significant role in mobilizing public opinion and promoting nationalist sentiment.
2. Tilak's Ganpati and Shivaji festivals were primarily religious celebrations and did not have a significant political dimension.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bal Gangadhar Tilak did indeed found the Marathi newspaper "Kesari," which became a powerful tool for disseminating nationalist ideas and mobilizing public opinion.  The newspaper played a crucial role in shaping political discourse and in fostering a sense of national consciousness among its readers.  Tilak's shrewd use of the media demonstrated the importance of communication in shaping political movements. His journalistic work highlights the significant role of the press in the Indian freedom struggle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Tilak's Ganpati and Shivaji festivals had a religious element, they also served as important platforms for promoting nationalist sentiment and mobilizing the masses.  The festivals were skillfully used to foster a sense of collective identity and to challenge British rule.  Tilak's strategic use of religious festivals demonstrated his political acumen and his ability to mobilize popular support for the nationalist cause.  The festivals transformed into mass movements that served as a potent force for nationalist mobilization.  The success of these festivals illustrates the complex interplay between religion, culture, and politics in the Indian freedom struggle.


**10. With reference to the impact of British policies on Indian society, consider the following statements:**

1. The British actively promoted social reforms such as the abolition of Sati and the legalisation of widow remarriage.
2.  The British implemented policies that exacerbated existing social inequalities and encouraged communal divisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British did eventually abolish Sati and legalize widow remarriage,  their initial approach to social reform was inconsistent and often driven by political expediency rather than a genuine commitment to social justice.  Their actions regarding social reform were often motivated by a desire to maintain control and stability, sometimes at the expense of genuine social progress.  The British approach to social issues reflects the complex and often contradictory nature of colonial rule.

Statement 2 is correct. British policies in India often exacerbated existing social inequalities and encouraged communal divisions.  The "divide and rule" policy, in particular, exploited existing religious and caste differences to weaken the collective resistance to British rule.  The British approach to social and political issues often served their own interests, contributing to the persistence of social problems and hindering the development of a unified national identity.  This policy had a long-lasting impact on Indian society, contributing to the persistence of communal tensions and social inequalities even after independence.  Understanding the British approach to social issues is crucial for analyzing the complexities of the colonial period and its impact on contemporary India.

**1. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The immediate trigger for the revolt was the introduction of the Enfield rifle, whose cartridges were rumored to be greased with animal fat, offending both Hindu and Muslim religious sensibilities.
2.  The revolt was entirely spontaneous, lacking any pre-planning or organized conspiracy, with the participation of sepoys and civilians erupting simultaneously across various regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The greased cartridges, believed to be greased with beef and pork fat, served as the immediate catalyst igniting the simmering discontent among sepoys.  This incident provided a focal point for the widespread resentment against British rule, triggering the initial mutiny in Meerut. The religious sensitivities of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers were deeply offended by the perceived sacrilege. This is well-documented in historical accounts of the revolt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the revolt certainly had a spontaneous element, especially in the initial stages, historical evidence suggests a degree of pre-planning and organization, albeit perhaps not as extensive or coordinated as some accounts claim. The circulation of chapattis and the use of symbolic red lotuses point toward some form of communication and coordination among rebel groups.  Furthermore, the near-simultaneous uprisings in several locations imply some level of pre-existing networks and shared grievances, although the extent of this organization remains a subject of historical debate.  The involvement of prominent leaders like Nana Sahib and the Begum of Awadh also indicates a level of strategic planning, even if it was not perfectly executed or centrally controlled. The lack of surviving rebel records complicates the assessment of the level of organization, but it does not negate the presence of some degree of planning.


**2. With reference to the participants in the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revolt enjoyed widespread support from all sections of Indian society, including the peasantry, zamindars, merchants, and the upper castes, uniting against British rule.
2.  While sepoys formed the initial core of the rebellion, the participation of civilian populations, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, significantly broadened its scope and intensity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the 1857 Revolt did see participation from various groups, it's inaccurate to claim *widespread* support from *all* sections of Indian society.  Significant segments of the population, including many rulers of princely states (e.g., the Sindhia of Gwalior, the Holkar of Indore), large zamindars, and sections of the upper classes, actively supported the British or remained neutral out of self-interest or fear of British retaliation.  The revolt was primarily concentrated in northern and central India, leaving many regions relatively unaffected. The economic interests of merchants and money-lenders were often at odds with the aims of the revolt, leading to their opposition.  Therefore, a claim of universal support across all social strata is a gross oversimplification.

Statement 2 is correct. The revolt's strength stemmed significantly from the participation of the civilian population, especially in regions like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.  Peasants and artisans joined the rebellion, motivated by their own grievances against British policies, high taxation, and the exploitative practices of money-lenders and new zamindars.  Their participation transformed the revolt from a primarily military mutiny into a broader popular uprising.  The scale of civilian involvement is evidenced by the high number of civilian casualties during the British suppression of the rebellion, demonstrating their significant role in the conflict.


**3. With reference to the leadership of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bahadur Shah Zafar, as the last Mughal emperor, provided strong and decisive leadership, uniting diverse rebel groups under his banner and effectively coordinating their military strategies.
2.  While Bahadur Shah Zafar served as a symbolic figurehead, the actual military leadership and coordination of the revolt were decentralized, with regional leaders like Nana Sahib, Rani Lakshmibai, and Kunwar Singh playing crucial independent roles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bahadur Shah Zafar, despite his symbolic importance as the last Mughal emperor, was not a strong or decisive leader.  His advanced age, indecisiveness, and lack of military experience hampered his ability to effectively unite and coordinate the diverse rebel groups.  His leadership was further weakened by internal conflicts within his own court and a lack of trust from some of the leading rebel figures.  The revolt lacked a unified command structure, which contributed to its eventual defeat.

Statement 2 is correct. The leadership of the 1857 Revolt was decentralized, with numerous regional leaders operating independently.  Nana Sahib in Kanpur, Rani Lakshmibai in Jhansi, and Kunwar Singh in Bihar, to name a few, led their respective forces with considerable autonomy.  While they acknowledged Bahadur Shah Zafar as the symbolic emperor, their actions were largely dictated by local circumstances and their own strategic considerations.  This lack of centralized command, while reflecting the diversity of grievances and regional contexts, ultimately hindered the rebels' ability to mount a coordinated and sustained challenge to British authority.  The decentralized nature of the leadership is a key aspect of understanding the dynamics of the revolt and its ultimate failure.


**4. With reference to the aftermath of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British responded to the revolt by implementing a series of administrative reforms aimed at strengthening their control over India, including the establishment of a unified, centralized administration and a reformed army.
2.  The revolt led to the immediate transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown, marking a significant shift in the governance of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British response to the 1857 Revolt included significant administrative and military reforms.  The revolt exposed the weaknesses of the East India Company's administration and its reliance on a sepoy army.  To prevent future uprisings, the British implemented reforms to centralize the administration, creating a more direct and effective system of control.  The army was also reorganized, with a reduced reliance on Indian sepoys and increased recruitment from loyal communities like the Sikhs and Gurkhas. These reforms aimed to strengthen British control and prevent similar rebellions in the future.  The changes implemented had lasting consequences for the structure and functioning of the Indian administration.

Statement 2 is correct. The 1857 Revolt directly led to the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown.  The Government of India Act 1858 formally dissolved the Company's rule and brought India under direct Crown governance.  This marked a significant shift in the relationship between Britain and India, with the administration now directly under the control of the British government.  The transfer of power was a direct consequence of the perceived failure of the Company to maintain control and the need for a more robust and centralized system of governance.  This event significantly altered the political landscape of India.


**5. Consider the following statements about the impact of the 1857 Revolt:**

1. The revolt significantly weakened the existing Hindu-Muslim unity, creating lasting divisions that hampered future nationalist movements.
2. The revolt, though ultimately unsuccessful in achieving independence, played a crucial role in shaping the course of Indian nationalism by fostering a sense of shared identity and anti-colonial sentiment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The assertion that the 1857 Revolt weakened Hindu-Muslim unity is a contentious claim. While communal tensions existed in some areas, the revolt initially saw significant Hindu-Muslim cooperation among both soldiers and civilians. The shared opposition to British rule temporarily transcended religious differences.  The later emergence of communalism was a complex process influenced by various factors, including British policies of divide and rule, but it cannot be solely attributed to the 1857 Revolt.  In fact, the revolt’s initial display of unity is a crucial fact to consider when analyzing the later rise of communalism, it is not a direct consequence of the revolt.  The shared struggle against a common enemy initially fostered a sense of unity, which later eroded due to other factors.

Statement 2 is correct. The 1857 Revolt, despite its failure to achieve immediate independence, served as a crucial turning point in the development of Indian nationalism.  The widespread participation of sepoys and civilians, the shared grievances against British rule, and the collective struggle against a common enemy significantly strengthened anti-colonial sentiment and a sense of shared Indian identity.  The revolt’s legacy lies in its contribution to the evolution of future nationalist movements, shaping the strategies and ideologies that would eventually lead to India's independence.  The event's impact on the collective consciousness of the Indian population is a key factor in understanding the subsequent growth of nationalism.  The experience of the revolt served as a catalyst for the development of a more unified and focused nationalist movement in the years that followed.

**1. With reference to the Indian nationalist movement in the early 20th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Surat Split of 1907 formally divided the Indian National Congress into moderate and extremist factions, with Gopal Krishna Gokhale leading the moderates and Bal Gangadhar Tilak spearheading the extremists.
2.  The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, while expanding Indian representation in legislative councils, introduced separate electorates for Muslims, a move initially supported by some Congress leaders but later criticized for exacerbating communal divisions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Surat Split of 1907 did indeed fracture the Indian National Congress along moderate and extremist lines, the leadership wasn't as neatly divided as stated.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent moderate, but the extremist faction encompassed various leaders, with Bal Gangadhar Tilak being a key figure, but not the sole leader.  The extremist camp included other significant figures like Lala Lajpat Rai and Bipin Chandra Pal.  The statement oversimplifies a complex political dynamic.

Statement 2 is correct. The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 did increase Indian representation in legislative councils at both the imperial and provincial levels.  However, a crucial element of these reforms was the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims. This meant that Muslim representatives were elected solely by Muslim voters, and vice-versa for other communities.  While initially seen by some as a way to secure Muslim participation in the political process, this policy ultimately proved to be detrimental to Hindu-Muslim unity and contributed to the growth of communal politics in the years to come.  This aspect of the reforms is a critical point for understanding the later trajectory of Indian politics.  The statement accurately reflects this historical development.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement:**

1.  The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob set fire to a police station, resulting in the deaths of policemen, directly led to the complete and immediate suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi.
2.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the Ottoman Empire's fate after World War I, initially served as a unifying factor for Hindus and Muslims within the Non-Cooperation Movement, but its waning relevance after the abolition of the Caliphate ultimately weakened the movement's broad-based support.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident in 1922, marked by violence against police, deeply disturbed Mahatma Gandhi, who believed in non-violent resistance.  This incident served as a catalyst for his decision to call off the Non-Cooperation Movement.  While the movement didn't end instantly, the decision to suspend it stemmed directly from the violent turn of events at Chauri Chaura, illustrating the movement's vulnerability to uncontrolled violence and underscoring Gandhi's commitment to non-violent methods.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Khilafat issue, relating to the post-World War I treatment of the Ottoman Empire and the position of the Caliph, played a significant role in uniting Hindus and Muslims in the initial stages of the Non-Cooperation Movement.  This shared concern against British policy provided a powerful impetus for joint action. However, the subsequent decline in the relevance of the Khilafat issue, particularly after Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's reforms and the abolition of the Caliphate, significantly reduced the movement's pan-religious appeal and contributed to its eventual decline.  The statement correctly identifies both the initial unifying role and the later weakening effect of the Khilafat issue.


**3. With reference to the early phases of the Indian independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swadeshi movement primarily focused on boycotting British goods and promoting indigenous industries, with minimal emphasis on direct political confrontation with the colonial government.
2.  Revolutionary terrorism, particularly prominent in Bengal, emerged as a response to increasing government repression and the perceived limitations of purely non-violent resistance strategies, involving the formation of secret societies and acts of violence against British officials.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Swadeshi movement, launched in response to the Partition of Bengal, had a strong economic component. It encouraged the boycott of British goods and the promotion of indigenous industries as a form of economic nationalism. While it did have a political dimension, challenging British authority, its primary focus was economic self-reliance and the revival of Indian industries.  This economic aspect is crucial to understanding the movement's broader impact.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The failure of the earlier, more moderate forms of resistance, coupled with increased government repression, led to the rise of revolutionary terrorism, particularly in Bengal. This involved the formation of secret societies like the Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar, which engaged in acts of violence against British officials.  This illustrates a divergence within the nationalist movement, with some opting for more direct and violent means of resistance. The emergence of revolutionary terrorism is a significant aspect of the struggle for independence, demonstrating the varied responses to colonial rule.


**4. With reference to the impact of the First World War on India, consider the following statements:**

1. The war effort led to a significant increase in India's industrial production, particularly in the textile and arms manufacturing sectors, ultimately contributing to the growth of Indian nationalism.
2.  The war's economic consequences, including inflation and widespread hardship, fueled discontent among various sections of Indian society, strengthening the anti-British sentiment and contributing to the rise of mass movements like the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the war initially disrupted some sectors, it also stimulated industrial growth in India.  The increased demand for war supplies led to expansion in certain industries, such as textiles and, to a lesser extent, arms manufacturing. This growth, however, was uneven and didn't benefit all segments of the economy equally.  Importantly, it did contribute to the development of an industrial base within India, laying the groundwork for future economic growth and indirectly strengthening the nationalist movement by fostering a sense of Indian industrial capability.

Statement 2 is also correct. The First World War had severe economic repercussions for India.  The war effort placed a heavy burden on the Indian economy, leading to inflation, shortages of essential goods, increased taxation, and widespread economic hardship. This economic distress, affecting various social strata, significantly contributed to the growing discontent and anti-British sentiment.  The widespread hardship fueled popular support for mass movements like the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements, which directly challenged British rule.  The statement correctly highlights the war's profound and multifaceted impact on the Indian socio-political landscape.


**5.  With reference to the  Swarajist movement within the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swarajists, led by Motilal Nehru and Chittaranjan Das, advocated for a complete boycott of all legislative councils, believing participation would legitimize British rule.
2. The Swarajist strategy involved contesting elections to legislative councils, using these platforms to obstruct government policies and raise public awareness, a tactic opposed by the "No-Changers" faction within the Congress.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swarajists, unlike the "No-Changers," believed in utilizing the legislative councils as a platform for political action.  Their strategy was not a complete boycott but rather to contest elections and utilize the councils to obstruct government policies, expose their weaknesses, and mobilize public opinion. This was a significant departure from the earlier complete boycott strategy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Swarajist strategy of participating in and utilizing the legislative councils was a point of contention within the Congress.  The "No-Changers," led by figures like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposed Council entry, arguing that participation would legitimize British rule and dilute the nationalist movement's focus on mass mobilization and non-cooperation.  The statement accurately captures this crucial internal debate within the Congress and the contrasting strategies employed.  The "No-Changers" favored continued constructive work and mass mobilization outside of the legislative framework.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the socio-religious reform movements in Maharashtra:**

1. The Prarthana Samaj, founded in Bombay, primarily focused on religious reform, advocating for monotheism and a strict interpretation of the Vedas.
2.  Jyotirao Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj aimed for a complete social transformation, going beyond mere reform, and directly challenging the Brahminical social order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prarthana Samaj did advocate for monotheism, its focus was broader than just religious reform.  It actively engaged in social reform initiatives, including promoting women's education and widow remarriage.  Its connection to the Bhakti movement of Maharashtra also indicates a less strict, more inclusive approach to religious practice compared to the description in the statement.  The Prarthana Samaj used persuasion and education rather than strict scriptural interpretation as its primary method.

Statement 2 is correct. Jyotirao Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj was a radical movement aiming for fundamental social change, not just incremental reform.  Phule directly challenged Brahminical dominance and worked for the upliftment of marginalized castes, advocating for their education and social equality. His vision was revolutionary, going beyond the more reformist approaches of other movements.  He challenged the very foundation of the caste system and aimed for a society free from exploitation.


**2. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements of 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, strictly adhered to vegetarianism as a core tenet, leading to a major split within the organization in 1893.
2. The Brahmo Samaj, initiated by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, primarily focused on reforming Hindu practices and beliefs, without explicitly advocating for a complete rejection of the Vedic scriptures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While vegetarianism was encouraged within some factions of the Arya Samaj, it was not a strictly enforced core tenet. The 1893 split was primarily caused by disagreements over the curriculum of the D.A.V. College and the inclusion of English education, with a secondary dispute arising over vegetarianism.  The emphasis on Vedic scriptures was central to the Arya Samaj's ideology, but this didn't preclude internal debates on dietary practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The Brahmo Samaj, while advocating for monotheism and the rejection of idolatry, didn't call for a complete rejection of the Vedas.  Instead, it emphasized a rational and critical interpretation of the scriptures, selecting what it considered to be the most relevant and morally sound teachings, while rejecting practices deemed superstitious or socially harmful.  The Brahmo Samaj aimed at purifying Hinduism rather than replacing it entirely.


**3. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian National Congress, from its inception, unequivocally demanded complete independence from British rule.
2.  The early nationalist leaders, often termed "Moderates," primarily employed constitutional methods of political agitation, focusing on petitions, public appeals, and working within the existing legal framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905) did not initially demand complete independence.  The focus was on gradual reforms within the British system, aiming for greater Indian participation in governance and administrative changes that would benefit the Indian population. The demand for self-rule evolved over time, with the rise of extremist factions later in the movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Moderates" of the early nationalist movement primarily relied on constitutional methods of political engagement.  They believed in working within the legal framework, submitting petitions to the British government, and appealing to British public opinion to bring about gradual changes.  This approach contrasted sharply with the later "Extremist" approach, which emphasized more assertive and radical methods.


**4. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Young Bengal movement, led by Henry Vivian Derozio, was characterized by its strong emphasis on traditional Hindu values and a rejection of Western influences.
2. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a significant role in advocating for widow remarriage, leading to its eventual legalization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Young Bengal movement, while having some internal disagreements, was fundamentally a radical movement inspired by the French Revolution and Western liberal thought.  It championed reason, free thinking, and social reform, challenging traditional customs and advocating for social and political change, not a return to traditional Hindu values.

Statement 2 is correct. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a key figure in the movement advocating for widow remarriage in Bengal. His efforts, combined with those of others, played a crucial role in the eventual legalization of widow remarriage, significantly impacting social attitudes and women's rights.


**5. Consider the following statements about the impact of the socio-religious reform movements:**

1.  These movements universally achieved widespread success in eradicating caste discrimination and untouchability across India.
2. The reform movements contributed to the rise of Indian nationalism by fostering a sense of shared Indian identity and culture, providing a counter-narrative to colonial claims of Indian inferiority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the reform movements did challenge caste discrimination and untouchability, their success in eradicating these deeply entrenched social evils was limited and varied regionally.  The persistence of caste discrimination even today demonstrates the incomplete nature of their impact in this area.

Statement 2 is correct. The reform movements played a significant role in the development of Indian nationalism. By promoting a reinterpretation of Indian history and culture, emphasizing India's rich philosophical and spiritual heritage, and advocating for social reform and self-improvement, they fostered a sense of national pride and identity that became a powerful force in the struggle for independence.  These movements provided a crucial counter-narrative to the British colonial ideology, which often portrayed India as a backward and inferior nation.  The emphasis on a shared cultural heritage, irrespective of religious differences, helped unite different groups in the fight for independence.

**1. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  Founded in Bombay, it initially focused on reforming Hindu society by challenging the caste system and promoting Vedic principles.
2.  The 1893 split within the Arya Samaj stemmed primarily from disagreements over the interpretation of Vedic scriptures and the role of Sanskrit in education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati in Bombay (1875), aimed at social reform within Hinduism.  A core tenet was the rejection of the caste system's rigidity and a return to what it perceived as the pure Vedic tradition. The emphasis on Vedic scriptures as the ultimate authority is a key element of its ideology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 1893 split in the Arya Samaj was a significant event, it wasn't solely about differing views on Vedic interpretation and the role of Sanskrit.  The schism involved various factors, including disagreements over strategies for social reform, the extent of engagement with contemporary social issues, and internal power dynamics within the organization.  Disagreements regarding meat-eating versus vegetarianism and the "Shuddhi" movement (reconversion of those who had converted to other religions) also played significant roles in the split.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies a complex historical event. The emphasis on Sanskrit was indeed a point of contention, but it was not the *primary* cause of the division.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Brahmo Samaj:**

1.  Initially advocating a return to the monotheistic essence of the Vedas, it later evolved to encompass a broader range of social reform initiatives, including women's education and widow remarriage.
2.  The Brahmo Samaj, originating in Bengal, maintained a consistently unified theological stance throughout its history, rejecting idolatry and emphasizing the worship of one God without priestly mediation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Brahmo Samaj's trajectory.  Founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, it began with a focus on reforming Hinduism by emphasizing the monotheistic aspects of the Vedas and opposing idolatry and ritualistic practices. However, under subsequent leaders like Debendranath Tagore and Keshab Chandra Sen, its scope expanded significantly to encompass broader social reform, including advocating for women's education, widow remarriage, and the eradication of other social ills. The movement's evolution reflects a shift from purely religious concerns to a more comprehensive engagement with social issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Brahmo Samaj's history was marked by internal divisions and evolving interpretations of its core tenets. While the rejection of idolatry and priestly mediation remained consistent themes, the precise nature of its theological stance underwent changes over time. Different factions emerged with varying degrees of emphasis on certain doctrines and practices.  The statement falsely presents a monolithic and unchanging theological position.  The internal conflicts and splits within the Brahmo Samaj demonstrate the dynamism of its ideological development.


**3. With reference to the Revolt of 1857, consider the following statements:**

1. The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie directly triggered the widespread sepoy mutiny, as it deeply affected the economic interests and regional patriotism of many sepoys who hailed from that region.
2. While sepoy discontent was a significant catalyst, the Revolt of 1857 encompassed broader popular grievances against British economic policies, administrative practices, and the perceived foreignness of the British regime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct in that the annexation of Awadh in 1856 significantly contributed to the growing unrest within the sepoy ranks.  A large number of sepoys originated from Awadh, and the annexation directly impacted their economic well-being and sense of regional identity.  The loss of their homeland and the subsequent changes in land revenue and taxation policies fuelled resentment and contributed to the atmosphere of rebellion that culminated in the 1857 uprising.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Revolt of 1857 was not solely a sepoy mutiny; it was a much broader rebellion fueled by widespread discontent across various segments of Indian society.  The British economic policies, which led to the impoverishment of peasants and artisans, the exploitative land revenue system, and the discriminatory administrative practices created widespread resentment.  Furthermore, the perceived foreignness of the British, their racial arrogance, and their lack of understanding of Indian culture and sensibilities exacerbated these feelings.  The uprising was a culmination of these long-simmering grievances, and the sepoy mutiny acted as a spark that ignited a much wider rebellion.


**4. With reference to the social reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The efforts of social reformers like Jotiba Phule focused primarily on uplifting the marginalized sections of society, particularly the non-Brahmins and untouchables, challenging the entrenched caste hierarchy.
2.  The social reform movements consistently maintained a unified approach, with all reformers agreeing on the need for complete abolition of caste and the adoption of Western-style individualistic values.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately highlights the crucial role played by social reformers like Jotiba Phule in advocating for the rights and well-being of marginalized communities. Phule's work directly challenged the oppressive caste system and its inherent inequalities, focusing on empowering the non-Brahmins and untouchables who faced severe social and economic discrimination. His efforts, along with those of other reformers, aimed to dismantle the hierarchical structure and create a more equitable society.  This focus on social justice and equality was a prominent feature of many reform movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The social reform movements of 19th-century India were not characterized by a unified approach.  While there was a shared goal of reforming society, diverse viewpoints and strategies existed among the reformers.  The degree of emphasis on Western values, the methods of reform, and the specific aspects of society targeted for change varied considerably.  Some reformers focused more on religious reform, while others prioritized social and political changes.  The reformers did not always agree on the pace or extent of change, nor did they always see eye-to-eye on the role of Western ideals in the process of reform.  The diversity of opinion and approach reflects the complex social and political landscape of the time.


**5. With reference to the development of education in British India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Wood's Despatch of 1854 advocated for a decentralized system of education, empowering local bodies to manage primary education and emphasizing vernacular languages as the medium of instruction at the primary level.
2. The Hunter Commission of 1882 focused primarily on higher education, recommending the establishment of more universities and the improvement of existing ones to cater to the growing demand for skilled professionals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the key aspects of the Wood's Despatch of 1854.  This landmark document proposed a more structured and comprehensive educational system for India. While it didn't entirely advocate for complete decentralization, it did significantly increase the role of local bodies in managing primary education.  A crucial element of the despatch was the emphasis on using vernacular languages in primary education to make education more accessible to the masses.  This represented a significant departure from earlier policies that predominantly focused on English-medium education.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hunter Commission of 1882 primarily focused on primary and secondary education. The commission recognized the shortcomings of the existing system at these levels, particularly the widespread illiteracy and the poor quality of primary schools.  Its recommendations emphasized the need for improvement and expansion of primary education, including the use of vernacular languages and the training of teachers. While it touched upon higher education, its main focus was on the foundational levels of the educational system.  The statement misrepresents the commission's primary area of concern.

**1. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arya Samaj, founded in Bombay, primarily focused on reforming Hindu society by challenging the caste system and promoting Vedic ideals.
2.  The Arya Samaj's social base was largely confined to trading castes in Punjab and Western Uttar Pradesh, contrasting with the broader reach of the Brahmo Samaj.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati in Bombay (although it later moved to Lahore),  was indeed a significant social reform movement within Hinduism.  Its core tenets centered on the rejection of idolatry and a return to the Vedic scriptures as the ultimate authority. This inherently challenged the existing caste system, advocating for a more egalitarian society based on Vedic principles. The movement promoted social reforms, including widow remarriage and the raising of the minimum marriageable age.

Statement 2 is also largely correct. While the Arya Samaj's influence extended beyond trading castes, a significant portion of its initial and strongest support base did come from trading communities in Punjab and Western Uttar Pradesh. This is in contrast to the Brahmo Samaj, which, while initially concentrated in Bengal,  had a more diverse and geographically widespread following across various social strata. The Arya Samaj's focus on Vedic interpretations resonated strongly with certain segments of the trading classes, who held a relatively higher level of literacy and were more receptive to reformist ideas.  However, it's crucial to note that  generalizing the Arya Samaj's social base *exclusively* to trading castes would be an oversimplification; it did attract followers from other communities as well, though perhaps less prominently.

Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Arya Samaj's history and impact.


**2. With reference to the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SGPC was formed in 1920 as a political offshoot of the Singh Sabhas, primarily to reclaim control of Sikh shrines from government-controlled committees.
2.  The Akali Dal, formed to coordinate the groups (Jathas) involved in the reclaiming of Sikh shrines, evolved directly from the SGPC's political activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The SGPC's origins are directly linked to the growing Akali movement in the early 20th century. While the Singh Sabhas laid the groundwork for religious and social reform within Sikhism, the SGPC emerged as a more direct political instrument to address the issue of control over Sikh gurudwaras.  The British administration often manipulated loyalist committees to manage these important religious sites, leading to widespread resentment among Sikhs. The SGPC was formed to challenge this control and establish greater autonomy for the Sikh community in the management of their religious affairs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SGPC played a crucial role in the Akali movement, the Akali Dal wasn't a direct outgrowth of the SGPC's political actions.  The Akali Dal emerged as a distinct political party to represent the interests of Sikhs more broadly, not merely the administrative concerns of the gurudwaras.  Although closely intertwined, the SGPC focused primarily on the management of gurudwaras, while the Akali Dal aimed for broader political representation and advocacy for the Sikh community.  The relationship was one of close collaboration but not direct hierarchical lineage.


**3. With reference to the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revolt, initially triggered by the introduction of the Enfield rifle, quickly escalated into a widespread rebellion against British rule, involving diverse groups including sepoys, princes, and landowners.
2.  The participation of Sikhs in the 1857 Revolt was widespread and crucial to the rebellion's success in Punjab.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 1857 Revolt, although often attributed to the greased cartridges of the Enfield rifle (which symbolized deeper grievances), quickly transformed into a much broader rebellion against British rule. The initial spark ignited widespread discontent among sepoys stemming from various factors – including resentment over British policies, the erosion of traditional power structures, and religious anxieties.  The revolt spread beyond the army, encompassing diverse groups such as disgruntled princes, landowners, and sections of the peasantry, although it lacked a unified national vision.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Contrary to the statement's assertion, the Sikhs' participation in the 1857 Revolt was not widespread and certainly not crucial to the rebellion’s success. In fact, many Sikh rulers and communities remained loyal to the British, and some actively assisted in suppressing the rebellion in Punjab. This loyalty stemmed from various factors, including the British's role in establishing the Sikh kingdom after the Anglo-Sikh Wars and the perceived threat from other Indian groups involved in the revolt. The active support of the Sikhs against the rebellion significantly limited its spread and success in the Punjab region.


**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Khilafat movement, advocating for the protection of the Ottoman Caliphate, provided a crucial platform for Hindu-Muslim unity during the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2.  The Non-Cooperation Movement, spearheaded by Mahatma Gandhi,  resulted in the immediate establishment of Swaraj and the complete withdrawal of British rule from India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Khilafat movement played a pivotal role in mobilizing Muslim support for the Non-Cooperation Movement. The shared outrage over the treatment of the Ottoman Empire by Britain and its allies created a common cause for Hindus and Muslims, solidifying a temporary alliance against British imperialism.  Leaders like the Ali Brothers, Maulana Azad, and others skillfully linked the religious concerns of the Khilafat movement with the broader nationalist aspirations of the Non-Cooperation Movement, attracting vast numbers of Muslims into the struggle for self-rule.  This unity, though ultimately temporary, was a significant achievement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement, while a significant and impactful event in India's struggle for independence, did not achieve its ultimate goal of immediate Swaraj and complete British withdrawal.  Although the movement demonstrated the potential of mass mobilization and civil disobedience, the British government eventually responded with repressive measures, leading to the movement's suspension by Gandhi in 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident.  The movement laid the groundwork for future struggles, but complete independence remained a distant goal.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists, primarily Moderates, focused on constitutional methods of agitation, aiming for gradual and orderly political progress within the framework of British rule.
2.  The early nationalist movement successfully achieved all of its stated reform goals through petitions and negotiations with the British government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905) was dominated by the Moderates. Their approach was characterized by constitutional means such as petitions, public meetings, and appeals to the British Parliament.  They operated within the existing legal and political framework, believing that gradual reforms were achievable through reasoned dialogue and pressure.  Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and others employed this strategy, hoping for a gradual transition towards greater Indian self-governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the early nationalists successfully raised awareness of Indian needs and grievances and influenced some minor reforms, they did not achieve all their stated goals.  Many of their petitions and appeals for significant administrative, economic, and political reforms were largely ignored or met with only minimal concessions by the British government.  The limitations of the Moderate approach became increasingly apparent as the British government's response to their demands remained largely inadequate, contributing to the emergence of the more radical and assertive nationalist factions later.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require detailed knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. With reference to the activities of the English East India Company in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Company's initial trade in Bengal primarily focused on the export of raw silk and cotton, gradually expanding to include manufactured goods like muslin.
2.  The Company's establishment of factories in Bengal led to the displacement of local artisans and the decline of indigenous textile industries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The English East India Company's early activities in Bengal centered on the lucrative trade of raw materials like silk and cotton.  Over time, the Company’s influence expanded, and it also became involved in the trade of finished textiles, particularly muslin, which was in high demand in European markets. This reflects the Company's gradual shift from primarily mercantile operations to a more dominant economic role in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The East India Company's expanding commercial activities in Bengal had a profound negative impact on local artisans. The Company's access to cheap labor and resources, coupled with its monopolistic practices, led to the decline of many indigenous textile industries.  Local weavers and artisans, unable to compete with the Company's production, often faced unemployment and economic hardship. This highlights the destructive economic consequences of early colonial trade. The Company's focus on maximizing profit often came at the expense of the local economy and its workforce.


**2. With reference to the Sannyasi and Fakir uprisings, consider the following statements:**

1. Warren Hastings' proclamation banning Sannyasis from Bengal and Bihar in 1773 was a direct response to widespread violence and disruption caused by these groups.
2. The uprisings were primarily confined to Bengal and Bihar, with limited spread to other regions of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Sannyasi and Fakir uprisings were not solely characterized by widespread violence, Warren Hastings' proclamation was indeed a reaction to the escalating unrest and disruption caused by these groups. The activities of some Sannyasis and Fakirs, their perceived threat to established order, and the difficulties in controlling their movements prompted the harsh measure of banning them from Bengal and Bihar. This demonstrates the colonial administration's response to challenges to its authority.  However, it's important to note that not all Sannyasis and Fakirs were involved in violence; many were simply religious ascetics whose movements were restricted.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the uprisings were concentrated in Bengal and Bihar, they were not strictly limited to these regions.  The Sannyasis and Fakirs' movements were more fluid and expansive, extending beyond these areas, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.  This broader geographical reach is a significant aspect of the uprisings, highlighting their impact on a wider area of India.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chauri Chaura incident, while leading to the suspension of the movement, ultimately strengthened the Congress's commitment to non-violent methods.
2.  The movement witnessed significant participation from women, who actively participated in boycotts and public demonstrations, defying traditional social norms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence against the police, led to Mahatma Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.  This was not a strengthening of the commitment to non-violence but rather a recognition that the movement was veering towards uncontrolled violence, threatening its overall success and jeopardizing the strategy of non-violent resistance.  The suspension reflected a pragmatic reassessment of the movement's trajectory, not an unwavering adherence to non-violent principles.

Statement 2 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement witnessed a remarkable surge in the participation of women.  They actively engaged in boycotts of foreign goods, participated in public demonstrations, and even defied traditional social norms by stepping outside the confines of their homes to participate in political action. This active engagement of women was a crucial element of the movement, demonstrating a significant shift in their social and political roles.


**4.  With reference to the impact of the annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie, consider the following statements:**

1. The annexation directly contributed to the widespread economic hardship faced by sepoys, exacerbating existing grievances within the British Indian Army.
2. The annexation of Awadh resulted in the immediate and widespread revolt of sepoys throughout British India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie in 1856 had significant repercussions, particularly for the sepoys.  The annexation disrupted the existing social and economic structures in Awadh, affecting the livelihoods of many individuals, including those serving in the British Indian Army.  This economic disruption, coupled with other existing grievances regarding pay, service conditions, and religious sensitivities, contributed to the growing discontent within the army and played a role in fueling the events leading up to the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny.  The annexation acted as a catalyst, adding to the pre-existing tensions and grievances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The annexation of Awadh was a contributing factor to the growing unrest that ultimately culminated in the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, but it did not directly result in an immediate and widespread revolt. The mutiny was a complex event with multiple causes, and while the annexation of Awadh added to the overall discontent, it was not the sole trigger for the rebellion. The uprising was a culmination of various factors over a period of time.


**5. With reference to the Bethune School and the women's education movement in the 19th century, consider the following statements:**

1. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a significant role in the establishment of the Bethune School, actively advocating for women's education.
2. The Bethune School, established in Calcutta in 1849, was the first institution in India to provide formal education to girls.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a strong advocate for women's education and played a crucial role in the establishment of the Bethune School. While J.E.D. Bethune is credited with founding the school, Vidyasagar's support and involvement were instrumental in its success and in furthering the cause of women's education within the broader social context of the time.  His contributions to the school's development and his advocacy for girls' education are well-documented.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bethune School was a pioneering institution in providing education to girls, it was not the absolute first in India.  Other initiatives for girls' education existed prior to 1849, though they may have been smaller in scale or less formally structured.  The Bethune School's significance lies in its establishment as a more structured and influential institution in promoting women's education within the colonial context.  The claim of being the very first institution is an oversimplification of the historical context of women's education in India.


**6. With reference to Ram Mohan Roy's work, consider the following statements:**

1.  In *Gift to Monotheism*, Ram Mohan Roy primarily focused on advocating for the adoption of Western scientific methods in Indian society.
2.  *Precepts of Jesus* represents Ram Mohan Roy's attempt to reconcile Hindu and Christian theological doctrines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ram Mohan Roy was a proponent of rationalism and reform, *Gift to Monotheism* primarily focused on advocating for the worship of one God, criticizing idolatry and polytheism prevalent in contemporary Hinduism.  It was a theological and religious treatise, not a work primarily concerned with Western scientific methods.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  *Precepts of Jesus* did not aim to reconcile Hindu and Christian doctrines. Instead, Ram Mohan Roy sought to extract and highlight the moral and ethical teachings of Jesus, separating them from what he considered to be the less relevant or problematic aspects of Christian theology.  His goal was not synthesis but rather a selective interpretation and presentation of Jesus's message for a broader audience.  This reflects his approach to religious reform and his attempt to promote a more rational and ethical approach to faith.

**1. With reference to the annexation of Awadh by the British, consider the following statements:**

1.  The annexation of Awadh in 1856 was primarily justified by the British on grounds of misgovernance and the need for administrative reforms, despite the Nawab having multiple heirs.
2.  The Doctrine of Lapse, a key instrument of Lord Dalhousie's annexation policy, was directly applied to Awadh, leading to its incorporation into British India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the maladministration in Awadh was a genuine concern, it served as a pretext for annexation.  The real motives were more complex, encompassing economic interests (access to Awadh's markets and resources) and strategic considerations (removing a potential power base). The Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, did have heirs, making the Doctrine of Lapse inapplicable in a straightforward manner.  The British manufactured the justification of misgovernance to circumvent this legal obstacle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Lapse was not directly applied to Awadh.  The Doctrine applied to states where the ruler died without a natural heir, allowing the British to annex the territory.  Since Wajid Ali Shah had heirs, the British instead used the pretext of misgovernance to justify the annexation, highlighting the flexible and opportunistic nature of their annexation policies.  This demonstrates how the British manipulated legal frameworks to achieve their imperial aims. The annexation of Awadh thus exemplifies the British use of both genuine concerns and fabricated justifications to expand their control.


**2. With reference to Lord Dalhousie's policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Dalhousie's annexation policy primarily focused on states lacking natural heirs, consistently applying the Doctrine of Lapse to justify acquisitions.
2.  The annexation of Satara, Nagpur, and Jhansi were all directly executed through the application of the Doctrine of Lapse, demonstrating its consistent and impartial implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Doctrine of Lapse was a significant tool in Dalhousie's annexation policy, it wasn't the *sole* basis. He also used other pretexts, such as misgovernance (as in Awadh) or perceived threats to British interests, to justify annexations.  This reveals a pragmatic and opportunistic approach, rather than a consistent adherence to a single principle. The Doctrine of Lapse was selectively applied, demonstrating its use as a tool to serve broader imperial goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although Satara, Nagpur, and Jhansi were annexed during Dalhousie's tenure, the application of the Doctrine of Lapse wasn't always straightforward or impartial.  The British interpretation of the Doctrine was flexible and often tailored to suit their political objectives.  In some cases, the application of the Doctrine was questionable, reflecting a biased and self-serving approach to territorial expansion. This highlights the manipulative use of legalistic arguments to justify the expansionist policies of the British East India Company.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of the annexation of Awadh:**

1.  The annexation of Awadh directly and significantly worsened the financial conditions of sepoys stationed there, causing widespread discontent within the British Indian Army.
2.  Increased land taxes imposed on sepoys’ families in Awadh after annexation contributed to the growing resentment among sepoys that ultimately played a part in the 1857 rebellion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the annexation of Awadh undoubtedly created economic hardship for many,  a direct and significant worsening of the financial conditions of *all* sepoys stationed there is an overstatement. The impact varied depending on individual circumstances and land ownership.  The economic grievances of sepoys were multifaceted, and linking them solely to the Awadh annexation oversimplifies a complex issue.  Other factors, such as pay disparities and religious anxieties, also contributed to the growing discontent.

Statement 2 is correct.  Increased taxation on the land owned or occupied by sepoys’ families in Awadh following its annexation is a documented grievance. This added to their existing economic pressures and fueled resentment against the British regime.  This specific grievance is well documented and demonstrates how seemingly minor policies could have significant consequences in fostering discontent among the sepoy community. The connection between increased land taxes and sepoy unrest is a crucial aspect of understanding the build-up to the 1857 rebellion.


**4. With reference to the administration of Awadh under the British, consider the following statements:**

1. The British East India Company's administration in Awadh, even before formal annexation, exerted significant indirect control over its governance through resident officials and other means.
2.  The Nawabs of Awadh, while nominally independent, were effectively puppets of the British East India Company, their autonomy severely restricted long before 1856.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British exerted considerable influence over Awadh's administration long before its formal annexation in 1856. This was achieved through the system of Residents, who effectively controlled policy decisions, and through various treaties and agreements that severely limited the Nawab's autonomy. This illustrates the gradual erosion of Awadh's sovereignty under the guise of a subsidiary alliance. The British strategy of indirect control is a key factor in understanding the eventual annexation.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Nawabs of Awadh maintained a facade of independence, their power was severely curtailed by the British. The subsidiary alliance system, coupled with the influence of resident officials, ensured that the Nawabs had little real autonomy in governing their state. This highlights the insidious nature of British imperialism, which often worked through indirect control rather than outright conquest. The Nawabs were effectively reduced to figureheads, their authority constrained by British interests.  This showcases the British strategy of maintaining a veneer of local rule while exercising actual control.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the social reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Savitribai Phule's activism primarily focused on uplifting the Brahmin community through educational initiatives.
2.  The Satya Shodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, actively campaigned against caste discrimination and promoted widow remarriage.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Savitribai Phule's work was significantly focused on challenging the caste system and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities, particularly women and the untouchables (Dalits).  Her efforts were directed towards empowering these oppressed groups, not the already privileged Brahmin community.  She actively worked to establish schools for girls from marginalized castes, demonstrating her commitment to social justice and equality.  The statement misrepresents the scope and target of her social reform work.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Satya Shodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule (and actively supported by Savitribai Phule), was a crucial social reform organization that directly challenged the rigid caste hierarchy prevalent in 19th-century Maharashtra.  The Samaj's core tenets included the elimination of untouchability and the promotion of widow remarriage, reflecting a broader commitment to social justice and equality. The organization played a vital role in raising awareness and mobilizing support for these progressive causes.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the contributions of Annie Besant:**

1.  Annie Besant's primary focus was on promoting Hindu religious orthodoxy and opposing Western influences in India.
2.  She played a significant role in the Home Rule Movement, advocating for Indian self-governance and collaborating with prominent Indian nationalists like Bal Gangadhar Tilak.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Annie Besant, though involved with the Theosophical Society, did not focus on promoting Hindu orthodoxy.  Her involvement with the Theosophical Society, which had a pan-religious approach, and her later advocacy for Indian self-rule demonstrate a more inclusive and progressive approach to religious and political matters. The statement misrepresents her multifaceted contributions to Indian society.

Statement 2 is correct.  Annie Besant's significant role in the Home Rule Movement is well-documented. She actively campaigned for Indian self-governance, recognizing the need for India to control its own destiny. Her collaboration with leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak highlights her ability to work with diverse Indian nationalists towards a common goal, demonstrating her commitment to Indian independence.  Her leadership and organizational skills were instrumental in mobilizing support for the movement.


**3. With reference to the life and work of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tilak primarily advocated for a gradual and constitutional approach to achieving self-rule, emphasizing peaceful methods of political engagement.
2.  His use of Ganapati and Shivaji festivals served as a subtle yet powerful means of fostering nationalist sentiment and mobilizing popular support.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Tilak initially engaged in constitutional politics, he later became a leading figure among the "extremists" within the Indian National Congress, advocating for more assertive and forceful methods to achieve Swaraj (self-rule). He was known for his strong nationalist views and his willingness to challenge British authority directly.  The statement fails to acknowledge his later shift towards a more militant form of nationalism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Tilak's astute use of the Ganapati and Shivaji festivals is a prime example of his shrewd political strategy. By transforming these religious celebrations into occasions for nationalist mobilization, he effectively bypassed direct confrontation with the British authorities while simultaneously instilling a sense of national pride and unity among the masses. This approach demonstrates his understanding of the importance of cultural mobilization in achieving political goals.


**4. With reference to Aurangzeb's reign and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aurangzeb's religious policies fostered a period of unprecedented religious harmony and tolerance across all communities in the Mughal Empire.
2.  His military campaigns, particularly in the Deccan, significantly strained the Mughal Empire's resources and contributed to its eventual decline.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aurangzeb's reign, while marked by periods of relative stability, is not remembered for religious harmony. His strict adherence to orthodox Islam and the re-imposition of the jizya tax (poll tax on non-Muslims) alienated many non-Muslim subjects, leading to increased religious tensions and conflicts.  The statement presents a highly inaccurate portrayal of his religious policies and their consequences.

Statement 2 is correct.  Aurangzeb's prolonged military campaigns in the Deccan, though initially successful in expanding Mughal control, ultimately proved to be a significant drain on the empire's resources and manpower.  The protracted nature of these conflicts, coupled with the rebellion of various groups, weakened the Mughal administration and contributed to the empire's gradual decline in the subsequent decades.  The statement accurately reflects the long-term consequences of his military strategies.


**5.  With reference to the pre-Congress nationalist organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. The British India Association, formed through the merger of several regional organizations, primarily focused on advocating for the interests of Indian landlords.
2.  The Indian Association, founded in Calcutta, played a crucial role in mobilizing public opinion and advocating for wider public interests beyond the concerns of elite groups.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The British India Association, a product of the merger of the Landholders' Society and the Bengal British Indian Society, initially prioritized the concerns of the landed gentry, reflecting the dominant socio-political landscape of the time. While it eventually broadened its scope to address some wider public issues, its origins and initial focus were firmly rooted in the interests of the landlord class.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian Association, formed in Calcutta under the leadership of Surendranath Banerjea, actively worked to broaden the scope of nationalist activism, going beyond the narrow interests of the elite. It successfully mobilized public opinion on a range of issues, including civil service reforms, press freedom, and tenant rights, demonstrating its commitment to wider public good.  The organization played a significant role in shaping the nationalist discourse and laying the groundwork for the Indian National Congress.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the 1857 Revolt:**

1. The revolt was primarily a spontaneous uprising driven solely by sepoy discontent over the introduction of new rifle cartridges.
2. Economic exploitation, discriminatory policies, and the perceived threat to traditional social structures were significant underlying causes of the revolt.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the greased cartridges incident served as a trigger, the 1857 Revolt was a far more complex event rooted in deep-seated grievances against British rule.  The immediate cause was the introduction of new rifle cartridges greased with animal fat, which offended both Hindu and Muslim religious sensibilities.  However, this was merely the spark that ignited a widespread rebellion fueled by long-term economic exploitation, political subjugation, and social disruption caused by British policies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 1857 Revolt was a culmination of various factors, including widespread economic hardship caused by British land revenue policies and the destruction of traditional industries.  The British administration's discriminatory practices, coupled with the perceived threat to established social and religious orders, created an environment ripe for rebellion.  These deep-seated grievances, rather than just the immediate trigger of the cartridges, were the key factors leading to the widespread and sustained nature of the revolt.



**7. With reference to the early phase of the Indian Nationalist Movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists primarily employed methods of armed rebellion and revolutionary terrorism to challenge British rule.
2.  The Indian National Congress, during this period, focused on constitutional agitation, petitioning, and building public opinion to achieve gradual political reforms.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early phase of the Indian Nationalist Movement (1885-1905), often termed the "moderate phase," was characterized by a predominantly constitutional and non-violent approach.  While there were some isolated instances of armed resistance, these were not the primary methods employed by the mainstream nationalist organizations. The statement misrepresents the dominant approach during this period.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian National Congress, in its formative years, adopted a strategy of constitutional agitation.  This involved submitting petitions, organizing public meetings, and working within the existing political framework to pressure the British government for reforms.  The focus was on building a strong and organized public opinion to advocate for gradual political change through peaceful and legal means. The statement accurately reflects the key strategies of the early Congress.


**8.  Consider the following statements about the impact of Aurangzeb's reign on the Mughal Empire:**

1. Aurangzeb's policies led to the strengthening of the Mughal administrative structure and a significant expansion of its territory.
2.  His rigorous religious policies and extensive military campaigns contributed to the weakening of the Mughal Empire and its eventual decline.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb's reign initially saw some territorial expansion, his policies ultimately weakened the Mughal Empire. His focus on religious orthodoxy and aggressive military campaigns in the Deccan, along with his financial mismanagement, strained the empire's resources and led to widespread unrest and rebellion.  The statement ignores the negative long-term consequences of his rule.

Statement 2 is correct.  Aurangzeb's stringent religious policies alienated significant segments of the population, particularly Hindus, weakening the social and political fabric of the empire.  The constant warfare in the Deccan, coupled with inefficient financial management, further depleted the Mughal treasury and military strength, making the empire vulnerable to internal and external challenges.  These factors contributed significantly to the weakening of the Mughal Empire during his reign and beyond, laying the groundwork for its eventual decline.


**9. With reference to the social reform activities of the 19th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gopal Hari Deshmukh, known as Lokahitawadi, primarily advocated for the preservation of traditional social structures and customs in Maharashtra.
2.  The Widow Remarriage Movement, spearheaded by reformers like Vishnu Shastri Pandit and Karsondas Mulji, aimed to challenge the social stigma against widow remarriage.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gopal Hari Deshmukh, also known as Lokahitawadi, was a prominent social reformer in Maharashtra who advocated for modernizing Indian society and reforming traditional social structures.  His focus was on rational principles and modern humanistic and secular values, not on preserving traditional customs.  The statement misrepresents his progressive social reform agenda.

Statement 2 is correct. The Widow Remarriage Movement was a significant social reform effort during the 19th century.  Reformers like Vishnu Shastri Pandit and Karsondas Mulji actively campaigned to challenge the social stigma and legal barriers against widow remarriage, advocating for the rights of widows to remarry and lead fulfilling lives. Their efforts represent a crucial aspect of the broader social reform movement in India.


**10. With reference to the role of the press in the nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kesari and Mahratta newspapers, edited by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, primarily promoted a moderate and constitutional approach to Indian nationalism.
2.  The newspapers like Sandhya and Yugantar played a significant role in disseminating nationalist ideas and advocating for revolutionary action during the early 20th century.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Kesari and Mahratta, edited by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, were instrumental in promoting a more assertive and nationalist viewpoint.  While initially advocating for constitutional means, they later became platforms for expressing more radical views, contributing significantly to the rise of militant nationalism.  The statement understates the newspapers' advocacy for more radical nationalist positions.

Statement 2 is correct. Newspapers like Sandhya and Yugantar, published in Bengal, were important tools for spreading nationalist ideas and advocating for revolutionary action.  These publications played a crucial role in mobilizing public opinion and inspiring revolutionary activities during the early 20th century.  They contributed significantly to the growth of revolutionary terrorism as a response to British repression.

**1. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Moderates primarily employed constitutional methods, focusing on petitions, public meetings, and resolutions to influence British policy.
2.  The early nationalists universally advocated for complete independence from British rule, rejecting any form of cooperation with the colonial administration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the approach of the Moderate nationalists during the early phase (1885-1905) of the Indian National Congress.  They believed in working within the existing constitutional framework, utilizing legal and peaceful methods to pressure the British government for reforms.  Their strategies included presenting petitions, organizing public meetings and demonstrations, and passing resolutions to articulate their demands.  They aimed at gradual, evolutionary progress rather than immediate and complete independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While some early nationalists held more radical views, the dominant approach among the Moderates was not a complete rejection of cooperation with the British.  Many believed that working within the system, while advocating for reforms, was a more effective strategy to achieve their goals. The demand for self-government or Swaraj evolved gradually, with the initial focus being on administrative and economic reforms within the existing British framework.  The call for complete independence became more pronounced later, with the rise of extremist nationalists.  The early movement was characterized by a diverse range of viewpoints, but complete and immediate independence was not a universal demand during this initial phase.


**2. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swadeshi movement exclusively focused on boycotting British goods and had minimal impact on the development of Indian industries.
2. Rabindranath Tagore actively participated in the Swadeshi movement, contributing to the establishment of Swadeshi stores and promoting national education.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swadeshi movement encompassed both the boycott of British goods and the promotion of indigenous industries.  The boycott aimed to weaken the British economy and demonstrate Indian resolve, while the promotion of Swadeshi industries aimed to strengthen the Indian economy and create self-reliance.  The movement significantly stimulated the development of Indian industries, leading to the establishment of new textile mills, soap factories, and other businesses.

Statement 2 is correct. Rabindranath Tagore was a prominent figure in the Swadeshi movement.  He actively supported the boycott of British goods and contributed to the establishment of Swadeshi stores.  Beyond this, he championed national education, believing it crucial to fostering Indian identity and self-reliance.  His involvement exemplified the cultural and educational dimensions of the Swadeshi movement.


**3. With reference to the Partition of Bengal in 1905, consider the following statements:**

1. The partition was primarily driven by administrative efficiency concerns, and the British government paid little attention to the potential impact on Bengali culture and nationalism.
2.  The Nawab of Dacca, supported by some Muslim leaders, favored the partition, believing it would benefit the Muslim majority in East Bengal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British government presented administrative efficiency as a justification for the partition, it was also a strategic move to weaken Bengali nationalism. The division of Bengal aimed to divide and rule, undermining the burgeoning nationalist movement concentrated in Bengal.  The British were acutely aware of the potential impact on Bengali culture and unity, which is why the partition sparked widespread protests and became a rallying point for the nationalist cause.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Nawab of Dacca, along with some other Muslim leaders, supported the partition.  They believed that a separate Muslim-majority province in East Bengal would lead to greater political and economic influence for the Muslim community.  This support, however, was not universally shared among the Muslim population, and many Muslims participated in the anti-partition movement. The British government also actively cultivated this divide to further their "divide and rule" policy.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the militant nationalists in India during the early 20th century:**

1.  Militant nationalists consistently advocated for passive resistance as their sole method of political action, rejecting violence completely.
2.  The arrest of key leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and the subsequent decline in the participation of Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghose significantly weakened the militant nationalist movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While passive resistance was a significant element in the strategies of some militant nationalists, it wasn't their exclusive method. The militant nationalist movement encompassed a broader range of tactics, including active resistance, boycotts, and even revolutionary terrorism in some cases.  The movement was characterized by a more assertive and confrontational approach compared to the Moderates, but it was not uniformly committed to non-violence.

Statement 2 is correct. The arrest and imprisonment of key leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak significantly weakened the militant nationalist movement.  The subsequent withdrawal from active politics of figures such as Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghose further hampered the movement's organizational strength and its ability to sustain momentum. The lack of a unified and effectively organized structure contributed to the government's success in suppressing the movement.


**5. With reference to the role of women in the Indian nationalist movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Women's participation in the nationalist movement was largely confined to providing support from the home front, with minimal involvement in active political activities.
2. The Swadeshi movement witnessed a significant increase in women's participation in public protests and boycotts, challenging traditional gender roles.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While women's roles in the early nationalist movement were often shaped by societal expectations, their participation extended beyond merely providing support from home.  Women actively participated in various ways, including attending meetings, contributing financially, and even engaging in direct action.  Their roles expanded over time as the movement progressed.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Swadeshi movement marked a significant turning point in women's participation in the nationalist struggle.  The movement provided opportunities for women to break traditional gender roles and actively participate in public protests, boycotts, and other forms of political activism.  Their involvement demonstrated a growing awareness of their political rights and responsibilities, laying the groundwork for greater participation in later movements.  The increased visibility and active role of women during the Swadeshi movement were crucial in shaping the future trajectory of women's involvement in India's freedom struggle.

**1. With reference to the Home Rule Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's Home Rule League focused primarily on establishing self-governance within the existing framework of the British Empire, advocating for gradual reforms rather than immediate independence.
2.  Annie Besant's Home Rule League actively promoted the idea of complete independence from British rule and employed more radical methods of political mobilization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the contrasting approaches of the two Home Rule Leagues that emerged during World War I.  Tilak's league, established in 1916, primarily focused on achieving Swaraj (self-rule) through constitutional means and working within the existing political system.  His emphasis was on gradual reforms and building Indian capacity for self-governance.  While he ultimately desired independence, his immediate strategy was more moderate, focusing on educating the public and pressuring the British government for concessions.

In contrast, Annie Besant's Home Rule League, launched in 1916, adopted a more assertive approach.  Although she also advocated for Swaraj, her vision was closer to complete independence from British rule. Her methods were more radical, utilizing mass mobilization, propaganda, and a broader appeal to the Indian populace to achieve her political goals.  The differences between the two leagues highlight the diverse strategies within the Indian nationalist movement during this period, with both moderate and more radical wings pursuing the common goal of self-rule.  The existence of these two distinct yet concurrent movements reflects the internal dynamics and evolving strategies within the Indian nationalist movement.



**2. With reference to the Indian National Congress's early years (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress initially focused solely on economic grievances, neglecting political demands until the rise of extremist factions later in its history.
2.  The Congress, in its early years, predominantly comprised members from the upper castes and educated elites, with limited representation from lower castes and rural populations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the early Congress did address economic issues like poverty, famines, and unfair trade practices, it also simultaneously pursued political objectives, including demands for greater Indian representation in government and constitutional reforms.  The focus on economic issues was integral to their political strategy, as it highlighted the exploitative nature of British rule and fueled the demand for political change.  The rise of extremist factions later did not represent a shift from economic concerns but rather a change in tactics and the urgency of demands.

Statement 2 is correct. The early Congress leadership and membership disproportionately consisted of upper-caste, educated Indians, largely from urban areas.  This demographic bias limited its initial reach to broader segments of Indian society.  While some efforts were made to expand inclusivity, the Congress's early years were characterized by a lack of widespread representation from lower castes and rural populations, a fact that would later be addressed by subsequent reformist movements and leaders within the Congress.  This limited representation highlights the socio-political context of the time and the challenges in building a truly representative national movement.


**3.  With reference to the activities of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tilak's newspaper, *Kesari*, primarily focused on promoting religious harmony and advocating for interfaith dialogue.
2.  Tilak's Ganapati and Shivaji festivals were significant in fostering a sense of Hindu nationalism and mobilizing popular support for the nationalist movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While *Kesari* did address some social issues, its primary focus was on promoting Indian nationalism and criticizing British policies.  Tilak used the newspaper as a powerful platform to articulate his political views, challenge British authority, and galvanize public opinion.  His writings often emphasized Hindu identity and history, contributing to the rise of Hindu nationalism, but religious harmony was not its central theme.

Statement 2 is correct. Tilak's shrewd use of the Ganapati and Shivaji festivals was a masterstroke in mobilizing mass support for the nationalist cause.  These festivals, celebrating Hindu deities and historical figures, transcended regional and caste boundaries, bringing together diverse segments of the population under a shared nationalist banner.  The festivals served as potent symbols of Hindu identity and resistance against British rule, demonstrating Tilak's effectiveness in harnessing religious sentiment for political mobilization.  This strategy effectively countered the moderate Congress's approach, demonstrating the power of mass mobilization and the mobilization of religious sentiments.


**4. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement was launched immediately following the failure of the Cripps Mission, signifying a complete loss of faith in negotiating with the British government.
2.  The movement witnessed widespread participation from various social groups, including peasants, workers, and students, but notably lacked significant support from the Princely states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quit India Movement, launched in August 1942, directly followed the failure of the Cripps Mission, which had failed to secure Indian support for the war effort.  The failure of negotiations with the British government left many Indians feeling disillusioned and fueled the resolve for more direct action. The movement marked a significant turning point, demonstrating a widespread rejection of British rule and a decisive shift towards the demand for immediate independence.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Quit India Movement saw participation from a broad spectrum of Indian society, including peasants, workers, and students, transcending traditional class and caste barriers.  However, the movement largely bypassed the Princely states, which remained largely aloof due to their own political interests and alliances with the British.  The limited involvement of the Princely states highlights the complex political landscape of India during this period and the diverse responses to the nationalist movement.  This uneven participation emphasizes the limitations of the movement despite its widespread appeal across many social groups.


**5. With reference to the activities of Jawaharlal Nehru, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nehru's foreign policy was primarily guided by non-alignment, seeking to avoid entanglement in Cold War power dynamics.
2.  Nehru's economic policies were strongly influenced by socialist ideology, prioritizing state control over economic planning.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Jawaharlal Nehru's foreign policy was a cornerstone of India's post-independence international relations.  Characterized by non-alignment, it aimed to maintain independence from both the US and Soviet blocs during the Cold War.  This policy, rooted in India's historical experience with colonialism, prioritized national sovereignty and peaceful coexistence, making India a significant voice in the international arena.  This neutral stance, however, did not mean isolation; India actively engaged in international forums and promoted peaceful resolution of conflicts.

Statement 2 is also correct. Nehru's socialist leanings significantly shaped his economic policies.  He favoured state-led planning and development, emphasizing social justice, equality, and the reduction of economic disparities.  While not a strict follower of Marxist principles, his policies prioritized public ownership, particularly in key industrial sectors, and aimed to create a mixed economy that balanced private enterprise with state intervention for social welfare.  The emphasis on social justice and state intervention reflects the broader ideological context of the post-colonial era and Nehru's vision for a socially equitable India.  This blend, however, was not without its critics, highlighting the complexities and debates surrounding economic development in post-independence India.

2. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire had no significant impact on the political dynamics of Goa, as the region remained largely unaffected.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The decline of the Vijayanagara Empire in the mid-16th century significantly altered the political landscape of South India. This power vacuum in Goa allowed the Bijapur Sultanate to expand its influence and eventually conquer the region. The weakening of Vijayanagara's authority created an opportunity for other regional powers to assert themselves, ultimately leading to the Sultanate's control over Goa.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The decline of the Vijayanagara Empire had a profound impact on the political dynamics of Goa. The weakening of a major regional power created instability and triggered a shift in the balance of power, making Goa vulnerable to conquest by the Bijapur Sultanate. The empire's decline directly contributed to the changing political environment in which the Portuguese subsequently conquered Goa.

Statement 2 is also correct. Kashtakari wood carving is indeed a traditional Goan art form.  The distinctive style and techniques reflect Goa's artistic heritage and the skills of its artisans.  The art form's origins in Goa highlight the region's rich artistic traditions.



**8.  With reference to Shivaji's interactions with Bijapur, consider the following statements:**

1. Shivaji's early career involved both alliances and conflicts with the Bijapur Sultanate, reflecting the complex political landscape of 17th-century Maharashtra.
2. Shivaji conducted military expeditions within the territories of the Bijapur Sultanate, expanding his own power and influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Shivaji's relationship with the Bijapur Sultanate was characterized by a complex interplay of alliances and conflicts.  At times, he forged alliances to gain strategic advantages, while at other times, he engaged in military actions against the Sultanate to expand his control over territories in Maharashtra. This reflects the fluid nature of political alliances and the constant power struggles in 17th-century India.

Statement 2 is also correct. Shivaji's military campaigns frequently targeted Bijapuri territories.  These expeditions were instrumental in expanding the Maratha kingdom's power and influence.  His military successes against Bijapur were pivotal in establishing the Maratha's dominance in the region.



**9. With reference to Shivaji's administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1. Shivaji's administrative system incorporated elements borrowed from the administrative practices of the Deccan Sultanates, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to governance.
2. Shivaji abolished the zamindari system, replacing it with a more equitable revenue system that directly benefited the peasantry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Shivaji's administrative system was a blend of innovative ideas and elements adapted from existing systems, particularly those of the Deccan Sultanates. This pragmatic approach reflects his understanding of the need to build an efficient and effective system of governance. He skillfully incorporated and adapted existing administrative structures to suit his needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Shivaji did *not* abolish the zamindari system. While he implemented reforms to improve the revenue system and reduce the exploitation of peasants, the zamindari system, though modified, continued to exist under his rule.  His administrative reforms aimed at streamlining revenue collection and reducing the power of some zamindars, but not at abolishing the system entirely.


**10. With reference to Shivaji's military strategies and campaigns, consider the following statements:**

1. Shivaji's military campaigns included raids on Mughal territories, demonstrating his willingness to challenge the powerful Mughal Empire.
2. Shivaji's military successes were solely based on his own military prowess and did not involve any alliances with other regional powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Shivaji's military strategies involved daring raids on Mughal territories, successfully challenging the might of the Mughal Empire. These raids were not only successful in acquiring resources but also in undermining Mughal authority and bolstering Maratha morale and prestige.  They demonstrated his tactical brilliance and his willingness to engage in unconventional warfare.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Shivaji's military successes were not solely based on his personal abilities.  He skillfully utilized alliances with other regional powers, such as the Bijapur Sultanate (at certain times), to achieve his strategic objectives.  His political acumen and ability to forge alliances played a vital role in his military victories.


**11. With reference to the Second Round Table Conference (RTC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Second RTC saw significant participation from various Indian political groups, including the Indian National Congress, Muslim League, and Hindu Mahasabha.
2.  The Second RTC resulted in a comprehensive agreement on the future constitutional framework for India, paving the way for immediate independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Second RTC was attended by representatives from a wide range of Indian political groups, demonstrating the diversity of political opinion in India at the time. The participation of the Indian National Congress, Muslim League, and Hindu Mahasabha, among others, highlights the complexities of the Indian political landscape and the various viewpoints on the future constitutional arrangements for India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Second RTC did *not* result in a comprehensive agreement on India's future.  While discussions took place, significant disagreements between various groups, especially regarding minority rights and representation, prevented a consensus. The failure to reach a consensus highlights the deep-seated divisions within Indian society and the inability of the British government to bridge these gaps.  The conference ultimately failed to resolve the key constitutional issues, delaying India's path to independence.


**12. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting greater self-governance to the provinces.
2. The Act led to the immediate establishment of an All-India Federation, comprising both British Indian provinces and princely states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 is a landmark legislation that introduced a significant degree of provincial autonomy.  It shifted power from the central government to the provinces, granting them greater control over their internal affairs.  This marked a crucial step towards self-governance within the framework of British rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act *proposed* the formation of an All-India Federation, this aspect of the Act was never implemented.  The conditions for the Federation's formation, including the accession of a sufficient number of princely states, were not met, preventing its realization.  The failure to establish the Federation highlights the limitations of the Act and the continuing resistance to centralized governance.


**13. With reference to the debates within the Indian National Congress after the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru advocated for the continuation of non-constitutional mass struggle, emphasizing the need for a continuous confrontation with imperialism.
2.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance in the provincial elections under the Government of India Act, 1935, but later relented and gave his approval.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, Nehru, along with other leftist elements within the Congress, strongly advocated for a continuation of non-constitutional mass struggle, believing that only continuous pressure could force the British to grant independence.  He viewed participation in the existing legislative system as a "spiritual defeat."

Statement 2 is also correct. While Gandhi initially expressed reservations about office acceptance in the provincial elections, he eventually conceded, recognizing the strategic value of utilizing the newly established provincial legislatures as a platform for political action and furthering the nationalist cause. He believed that even limited power within the system could be used to advance India's interests.  This decision, however, was met with resistance from some within the Congress who remained opposed to collaboration with the British system.


**14. With reference to the Congress Socialist Party (CSP), consider the following statements:**

1. The CSP, formed within the Indian National Congress, maintained its affiliation with the Congress until the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.
2. The CSP advocated for socialist ideals and worked to integrate the interests of workers and peasants into the nationalist movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CSP, while initially within the Congress, formally disassociated itself from the Congress in 1948, several months after Gandhi's assassination. The reasons for the split included ideological differences and differing approaches to the struggle for independence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CSP was a significant socialist group within the Congress.  Its primary objective was to integrate the interests of workers and peasants into the broader nationalist struggle, advocating for a socialist vision for independent India. The CSP played a key role in promoting socialist ideas and organizing workers and peasants.  Their influence on the Congress's left wing is undeniable.


**15. With reference to the formation of linguistic states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The demand for linguistic reorganization of states emerged immediately after independence, driven by linguistic pluralism and regional identities.
2.  The States Reorganization Commission (SRC), appointed by the Nehru government, recommended the immediate creation of all linguistic states, without any consideration for national unity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The demand for linguistic states arose soon after independence, reflecting the deep-seated linguistic and regional identities within India.  The pre-independence administrative boundaries had often ignored linguistic divisions, leading to demands for reorganization to better reflect regional identities and languages.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SRC, while recognizing the importance of linguistic identities, did *not* recommend the immediate creation of all linguistic states.  The commission balanced the need for linguistic reorganization with the imperative of maintaining national unity.  The final implementation of linguistic states was a gradual process, with considerations given to administrative feasibility and potential disruptions to national unity.  The SRC's report was a significant step in the reorganization but did not lead to the immediate creation of all linguistic states.


**16. With reference to the Nehruvian era's economic policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nehru's economic policies favored a mixed economy, incorporating elements of both capitalist and socialist models.
2.  The five-year plans implemented during the Nehruvian era primarily focused on the development of heavy industries and neglected the agricultural sector.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Nehru's economic policies were based on the concept of "democratic socialism" and advocated for a mixed economy.  This approach involved both public sector involvement in key industries and infrastructure and the private sector's role in other areas of the economy. The five-year plans attempted to balance socialist ideals with pragmatic economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the five-year plans did prioritize heavy industries, especially from the Second Five-Year Plan onwards, they also made significant investments in the agricultural sector, particularly in irrigation and infrastructure. The First Five-Year Plan, in fact, primarily focused on agricultural development. The emphasis on heavy industry should not be interpreted as a complete neglect of the agricultural sector.  The five-year plans reflected a broader strategy for economic growth that attempted to address both industrial and agricultural development.


**17. With reference to the non-alignment movement (NAM) during the Nehruvian era, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's non-alignment policy was characterized by its refusal to participate in any military alliances or power blocs.
2.  NAM's primary objective was to remain completely neutral in international conflicts and avoid any engagement with either the US or the Soviet Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's non-alignment policy, a cornerstone of Nehru's foreign policy, was based on its refusal to join any military alliances or be aligned with either the US or the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  This independent stance allowed India to pursue its own foreign policy objectives, free from the pressures of superpower rivalry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Non-alignment did *not* imply complete neutrality. While NAM aimed to avoid entanglement in superpower conflicts, it also actively participated in international forums and advocated for decolonization, peace, and international cooperation.  India, under Nehru's leadership, actively engaged with both the US and the Soviet Union, maintaining diplomatic relations and pursuing its own national interests.  Non-alignment was a strategy of independence, not complete isolation or neutrality.


**18. With reference to the  Indian National Congress's activities during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Surat Split of 1907, which significantly weakened the Indian National Congress, occurred before the emergence of the Swarajist Party.
2. The Indian National Congress's participation in the Round Table Conferences was intended to negotiate a more favorable constitutional framework for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Surat Split of 1907, a major internal division within the Indian National Congress, occurred well before the emergence of the Swarajist Party in the 1920s. The Surat Split weakened the Congress significantly, highlighting the internal tensions and differences in approach within the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Indian National Congress's decision to participate in the Round Table Conferences was a strategic move aimed at negotiating a more favorable constitutional framework for India.  While the Congress ultimately rejected the outcomes of these conferences, their participation reflected a hope for achieving a compromise that would lead to a greater degree of self-governance.  The participation in the RTC's was a calculated risk taken by the Congress to influence the shape of India's future political system.


**19. With reference to the activities of revolutionary groups in India during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), initially focused on armed revolution and later incorporated socialist ideals.
2. The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, was a significant act of armed rebellion in Bengal, involving a large number of female participants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The HRA, later the HSRA, initially focused on armed revolutionary actions to overthrow British rule.  However, over time, their ideology evolved to incorporate socialist ideals, reflecting the influence of Marxist and communist thought.  This evolution highlights the changing nature of revolutionary thought within the Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid was a remarkable act of armed rebellion, notable for the significant participation of women revolutionaries.  The women played crucial roles in the planning and execution of the raid, demonstrating their commitment to the cause of Indian independence. The raid's success, albeit temporary, showcased the determination of revolutionary groups and the growing involvement of women in armed struggle.


**20. With reference to the communal award and the Poona Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Communal Award, announced by the British government, provided for separate electorates for various religious and caste groups in India.
2. The Poona Pact, negotiated between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, resulted in the abolition of separate electorates for the depressed classes, while increasing their reserved seats in the legislature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Communal Award, a controversial decision by the British government, established separate electorates for various minority groups in India, including Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, and the depressed classes.  This divisive policy was intended to appease minority communities but ultimately exacerbated communal tensions and furthered the British policy of "divide and rule."

Statement 2 is also correct. The Poona Pact, a significant agreement reached between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, resulted in the abandonment of separate electorates for the depressed classes.  However, the pact did increase the number of reserved seats for the depressed classes in the legislature, addressing some of their concerns for representation. The Poona Pact highlights the complexities of the negotiations around minority representation and the efforts to balance the concerns of different groups.  The pact, however, did not fully resolve the underlying issues of caste discrimination.

**1. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement significantly boosted the production of Khadi and other indigenous textiles, leading to a decline in imports of British textiles.
2.  The movement primarily focused on economic boycott and did not involve any significant political actions or demands.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Swadeshi Movement, triggered by the Partition of Bengal, actively promoted the use of Indian-made goods, particularly Khadi. This led to a surge in the production of indigenous textiles and a noticeable decrease in the reliance on British imports.  The movement's emphasis on self-reliance and economic nationalism aimed to weaken the British economy and strengthen India's. While the extent of the decline in British textile imports is debatable and varied regionally, the boost to Khadi production is a well-documented fact.  The movement's success in this area is also linked to the rise of nationalistic sentiment and the increased participation of artisans and weavers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Swadeshi Movement was far more than just an economic boycott. While the economic aspect, including boycotts of British goods, was central, the movement was inherently intertwined with significant political actions and demands.  It involved widespread protests, demonstrations, and the active participation in political discourse. The movement also fueled the rise of nationalist political organizations and leaders, and it significantly contributed to the growth of the Indian nationalist movement as a whole.  It was a crucial step in the evolution of the Indian freedom struggle, pushing beyond mere economic protest to challenge British political authority directly.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Partition of Bengal:**

1.  The partition primarily aimed to divide the Bengali population along religious lines, thereby weakening the nationalist movement.
2.  The partition was immediately followed by widespread communal violence between Hindus and Muslims across Bengal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the partition did create administrative divisions within Bengal, its primary aim was not explicitly to divide the Bengali population along religious lines.  The British administration's stated rationale focused on administrative efficiency and better governance of a large and diverse province.  However, the partition's unintended consequence was the exacerbation of existing religious and linguistic tensions, which the nationalists effectively used to galvanize opposition to British rule.  The movement against the partition unified Bengalis across religious divides, demonstrating the limitations of the British strategy.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the partition fueled nationalist sentiment and led to protests and unrest, it did not immediately result in widespread communal violence between Hindus and Muslims across the entirety of Bengal.  While isolated incidents of communal tension did occur, the large-scale communal violence that characterized the partition of India in 1947 did not immediately follow the 1905 partition of Bengal. The initial response was primarily political and nationalistic, with the focus on opposing the British policy. Communal tensions were certainly present and exploited by some, but they were not the immediate and dominant feature of the immediate aftermath.


**3. With reference to the Indian Civil Service (ICS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICS was established by Lord Cornwallis during his tenure as Governor-General of India, primarily to ensure efficient administration of the British territories.
2.  The ICS initially consisted primarily of Indians, with a gradual increase in the proportion of British officers over time.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lord Cornwallis did implement significant reforms in the Indian administration, including the reorganization of the civil service, the ICS as a distinct entity wasn't established during his tenure.  The ICS gradually evolved over time through several acts and reforms, culminating in its formal establishment much later.  Cornwallis's reforms laid the groundwork for a more structured civil service, but the specific structure and name of the ICS came much later.  The evolution of the ICS reflects the changing administrative needs and policies of the British Raj.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The ICS was predominantly composed of British officers from its inception. This reflected the British policy of maintaining control over key administrative positions within India.  The inclusion of Indians in the ICS was limited, and even as some Indians qualified for the service, they faced significant hurdles and were generally a small minority compared to their British counterparts.  This imbalance in representation became a major point of contention within the Indian nationalist movement, highlighting the unequal nature of British rule.  The lack of Indian representation in the higher echelons of the ICS was a significant factor contributing to the nationalist movement's demands for greater self-governance.


**4. With reference to the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant powers to the elected provincial governments.
2. The Act abolished the bicameral legislature at the centre, establishing a unicameral system instead.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act 1935 is a landmark piece of legislation in the history of British India. One of its key features was the introduction of provincial autonomy. This meant that elected provincial governments were granted significant control over several areas of administration, marking a shift towards greater self-governance at the provincial level.  However, the extent of autonomy was limited, as the Governor-General still held considerable powers.  The Act aimed to address the growing demands for self-rule by introducing a measure of decentralization.  The success of the provincial autonomy varied across different provinces.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act 1935 did *not* abolish the bicameral legislature at the centre. It retained the bicameral system, comprising the Council of State (Upper House) and the Federal Assembly (Lower House).  This structure reflected the British preference for a system of checks and balances, even as it introduced elements of self-governance.  The bicameral system continued to be a key part of the Indian political structure, even after independence, though with modifications.  The Act's retention of the bicameral system reflects the complexities of constitutional evolution in India under British rule.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Non-Cooperation Movement:**

1. The movement saw widespread participation from all sections of Indian society, including peasants, workers, and Muslims.
2.  The movement's success was largely due to its strictly non-violent nature, which prevented any government repression.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Non-Cooperation Movement did involve participation from various sections of Indian society, it wasn't universal.  The extent of participation varied significantly across regions and social groups.  While there was considerable support from some segments of the peasant and worker population, the level of involvement was not uniform.  Furthermore, Muslim participation decreased after the Khilafat movement lost momentum. This highlights the complexities of mobilizing diverse sections of Indian society during the national movement.  The movement's success was not solely dependent on the participation of all sections of society.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement, while advocating for non-violence, did experience instances of violence in some areas. This led to government repression, including arrests and the use of force, which ultimately contributed to the movement's suspension.  Gandhi's efforts to maintain strict non-violence were not always successful, and the movement's limitations are linked to the challenges of controlling mass participation and the government's response.  The movement's eventual curtailment reflects the difficulties in sustaining a large-scale movement based solely on non-violent methods under colonial rule.


**6. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Round Table Conference was attended by representatives from the Indian National Congress, making it a significant step towards achieving self-rule.
2.  The conferences resulted in a significant constitutional settlement that addressed the concerns of all major communities in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The First Round Table Conference was *not* attended by representatives from the Indian National Congress.  The Congress boycotted the conference, believing that the British government was not serious about granting meaningful self-rule.  The absence of the Congress significantly undermined the conference's effectiveness and its ability to arrive at a comprehensive constitutional settlement.  The boycott reflected the Congress's evolving strategy and its increasing skepticism towards the British government's intentions.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Round Table Conferences, despite the participation of various Indian groups, did not result in a significant constitutional settlement that addressed the concerns of all major communities in India.  The conferences failed to achieve a consensus on key issues such as the representation of minorities and the degree of self-governance to be granted to India.  The failure of the conferences contributed to the escalation of political tensions and ultimately paved the way for further constitutional developments, including the Government of India Act 1935.  The conferences highlighted the difficulties in achieving a negotiated settlement between the British government and the diverse Indian political groups.


**7. With reference to the Poona Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The pact abolished the system of separate electorates for the depressed classes, replacing it with a system of reserved seats within joint electorates.
2. The pact was signed between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar without any involvement from the British government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Poona Pact, a crucial agreement in the history of India's struggle for independence, addressed the issue of representation for the depressed classes (Dalits).  The pact successfully resolved the crisis triggered by the Communal Award, which had proposed separate electorates for Dalits.  The Poona Pact abolished separate electorates and instead provided for reserved seats for the depressed classes within the general electorate.  This ensured their representation while maintaining a degree of social integration.  The pact was a significant compromise that averted a major political confrontation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar were the key figures in negotiating and signing the Poona Pact, the British government was indirectly involved. The pact was essentially an agreement to modify the Communal Award, a decision made by the British government.  The British government's acceptance of the Poona Pact as a modification of the Communal Award demonstrates its role in shaping the political landscape of India during this period.  The involvement of the British government underscores the complexities of negotiating constitutional arrangements under colonial rule.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the Salt Satyagraha:**

1. The Salt Satyagraha was primarily a symbolic act of defiance against the British salt tax and did not have a significant impact on the broader movement.
2. The march to Dandi was meticulously planned and executed, with widespread support and participation from across India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Salt Satyagraha, while symbolically powerful in its defiance of the salt tax, had a profound impact on the broader movement.  The act of making salt from seawater became a powerful symbol of resistance against British rule, inspiring widespread participation across India.  The Satyagraha's success in mobilizing the masses and challenging British authority was a crucial turning point in the freedom struggle.  Its impact extended far beyond its symbolic significance.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that the Dandi March was planned, but the statement overstates the level of widespread, uniform support and participation from across India. While the march gained significant attention and inspired others to participate in acts of civil disobedience, the level of involvement varied regionally.  Some areas saw massive participation, while others had limited involvement. The movement's success was not solely dependent on uniform support across India but rather on its ability to galvanize resistance in strategic locations.  The varied levels of participation reflect the complexities of a mass movement under colonial rule.


**9. With reference to the Nehru Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nehru Report recommended Dominion Status as the ultimate goal of the Indian National Congress.
2.  The Report was unanimously accepted by all factions within the Indian National Congress.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nehru Report, drafted by a committee headed by Motilal Nehru in 1928, was a significant document outlining the Congress's constitutional demands.  The report proposed Dominion Status as the immediate goal, envisioning a future India within the British Commonwealth.  This proposal, while advocating for a significant degree of self-rule, was not a demand for complete independence.  The report's proposal reflected the Congress's evolving political strategy and its attempts to negotiate with the British government.  The report's recommendations were a crucial step in the evolution of the Indian freedom struggle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nehru Report was *not* unanimously accepted by all factions within the Indian National Congress.  The report faced opposition from some within the Congress who advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) rather than Dominion Status.  The divisions within the Congress regarding the ultimate goal of the movement highlight the internal debates and differing perspectives within the nationalist movement.  The disagreement on the acceptance of the Nehru Report foreshadowed the future schisms within the Congress.


**10. With reference to the activities of the Indian National Congress during the period 1929-1931, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress in 1929 formally declared Purna Swaraj as the goal of the Congress.
2. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact led to the immediate and complete cessation of all civil disobedience activities across India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress, held in December 1929, is a pivotal moment in the history of the Indian independence movement.  At this session, the Congress formally declared Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as its ultimate goal, marking a significant shift from the earlier demand for Dominion Status.  This declaration represented a hardening of the Congress's stance towards British rule and signaled a more assertive approach to achieving self-rule.  The declaration was a turning point, signaling the Congress's commitment to complete independence and its willingness to pursue more radical methods to achieve it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact, signed in March 1931, did lead to a temporary suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement. However, this was not an immediate or complete cessation of all activities across India.  The pact, while achieving some concessions from the British government, did not end all forms of resistance or dissent.  The suspension of the movement was a tactical decision to participate in the Second Round Table Conference, and it was followed by the resumption of civil disobedience later.  The pact’s impact was complex and varied regionally.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. With reference to the administrative policies of the British in India after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British actively promoted a policy of "divide and rule" by exacerbating existing religious and caste divisions, primarily focusing on creating conflict between Hindus and Muslims to undermine the burgeoning nationalist movement.
2.  Following the 1857 revolt, the British initially adopted a repressive policy towards Muslims, but later, strategically utilized sections of the educated Muslim elite to counter the growing influence of the nationalist movement led by Hindu intellectuals.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of British administrative policy post-1857.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the "divide and rule" strategy, a cornerstone of British imperial policy in India.  The British actively exploited pre-existing social and religious cleavages, particularly the Hindu-Muslim divide, to prevent the formation of a unified national front against their rule. This is evidenced by their selective support for certain communities and their manipulation of resources and opportunities to foster inter-communal tension.  Statement 2 is also correct. The initial repression of Muslims after the 1857 revolt was followed by a calculated shift in policy. The British recognized the potential of engaging sections of the educated Muslim elite, offering them incentives and positions of influence within the administration, to counter the growing nationalist movement, thereby weakening its overall efficacy.  This strategic manipulation of religious identities was a key element in maintaining British control.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they fail to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of British post-1857 administrative policies.


**2. With reference to British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, primarily implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars proprietary rights over their lands, intending to incentivize agricultural improvements, but ultimately led to the growth of absentee landlordism and the exploitation of ryots.
2. The Ryotwari system, implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly collected revenue from individual cultivators, aiming for increased revenue collection but frequently resulted in over-assessment, peasant indebtedness, and widespread land alienation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key features and consequences of the British revenue systems in India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the core tenets of the Permanent Settlement. While the intention was to create a stable and productive land tenure system by granting zamindars proprietary rights, the high revenue demands and lack of effective regulation led to the emergence of absentee landlordism. Zamindars often neglected agricultural improvements, focusing instead on maximizing rent extraction from the ryots (peasants), leading to their exploitation and impoverishment.  Statement 2 also correctly portrays the Ryotwari system's flaws.  Direct revenue collection from individual cultivators, although designed to increase government revenue, resulted in over-assessment due to inaccurate land surveys and estimations of agricultural yield. This led to widespread peasant indebtedness, forcing many cultivators to lose their lands to moneylenders.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to capture the complexities and shared shortcomings of both major British revenue systems, which significantly shaped the socio-economic landscape of rural India.


**3. With reference to the impact of British rule on Indian society, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British consistently supported social reforms in India, aiming to modernize and uplift Indian society, even facing opposition from conservative elements.
2.  The British significantly neglected social services such as education, sanitation, and public health, prioritizing military expenditure and administrative costs over the welfare of the Indian population, leading to widespread social backwardness.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects a significant aspect of the British impact on Indian society.  The British administration in India consistently prioritized military expenditure and administrative costs over social development.  This resulted in a stark disparity in resource allocation, with social services such as education, sanitation, and public health severely neglected.  This neglect had long-lasting consequences, contributing to widespread social backwardness and hindering the overall progress of the Indian population. The few initiatives undertaken often favored urban areas and elite sections of society, further exacerbating existing inequalities. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the British did initiate some social reforms, such as the abolition of Sati, their overall approach was inconsistent and often driven by political expediency rather than genuine commitment to social upliftment.  They often wavered in their support for reform, particularly when facing opposition from conservative sections of Indian society, ultimately prioritizing the maintenance of their own power and control.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the British response to the educated Indian elite:**

1. The British initially welcomed the emergence of an educated Indian class, believing it would facilitate the smooth functioning of the administration and aid in the process of modernization.
2.  As the educated Indian elite increasingly utilized their knowledge and influence to advocate for greater Indian participation in governance and challenge British authority, the British attitude shifted from encouragement to hostility and repression.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the evolving British response to the educated Indian elite. Initially, the British saw the rise of an educated Indian class as beneficial to their administration.  A Western-educated elite was seen as a potential tool for managing the complexities of governing a vast and diverse population.  However, this initial positive attitude dramatically shifted as the educated Indians began to utilize their knowledge and organizational skills to challenge British rule.  The formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885 marked a turning point, signifying the emergence of a coherent and organized nationalist movement.  The British perceived this movement as a direct threat to their authority and responded with increasingly hostile policies, aimed at suppressing dissent and limiting the influence of the educated elite. This shift from encouragement to repression is a crucial aspect of understanding the dynamics of British rule in India.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, failing to capture the nuanced and changing British policy towards the educated Indian class.


**5. With reference to the British policy towards Princely States, consider the following statements:**

1. Before 1857, the British actively pursued a policy of annexing Princely States, but after the 1857 revolt, this policy was largely abandoned in favor of maintaining the princely states as a bulwark against future uprisings.
2.  While the British outwardly respected the territorial integrity of Princely States post-1857, they simultaneously exerted significant control over their internal affairs through the system of Residents and paramountcy, effectively subordinating them to British authority.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the British policy toward Princely States.  Statement 1 correctly points out the shift in British policy after the 1857 revolt. The pre-1857 period witnessed aggressive annexation of Princely States through policies like the Doctrine of Lapse.  However, the 1857 revolt highlighted the risks of alienating the princely class.  Post-1857, the British adopted a policy of maintaining the Princely States, recognizing their value as a buffer against potential uprisings and as a source of support for their rule.  Statement 2 is also correct.  Even though the British outwardly respected the territorial integrity of Princely States, they maintained substantial control over their internal affairs through the system of British Residents stationed in these states.  The concept of paramountcy asserted British supremacy and allowed for interference in the internal administration, including the appointment and dismissal of ministers and officials.  This ensured the subordination of Princely States to British interests.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect, as they fail to capture the dual nature of British policy towards the Princely States—a combination of preservation and control.

**1. With reference to the Partition of Bengal (1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The partition was primarily based on the linguistic differences between Eastern and Western Bengal.
2.  Lord Curzon's primary intention behind the partition was to weaken the political power of Bengal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Partition of Bengal in 1905, implemented by Lord Curzon, was a complex event with multiple motivations. While linguistic differences between the eastern and western regions played a role, it wasn't the sole or even primary factor.  The vastness and administrative challenges of governing undivided Bengal were significant considerations. The administration struggled to effectively manage the region's resources and population due to its size.  The decision to partition was thus partly driven by administrative expediency.  However, Curzon's primary aim was political. He aimed to weaken the burgeoning nationalist movement centered in Bengal, which was perceived as a threat to British rule.  By dividing Bengal, the British hoped to diminish the collective strength of the Bengali nationalists and make it harder for them to organize and mobilize against British policies. The creation of two smaller, less powerful administrative units was seen as a way to curb the growing influence of Bengali nationalism.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 reflect aspects of the partition's complexities, with statement 2 representing the core political strategy.


**2. With reference to the All-India Muslim League, consider the following statements:**

1.  The All-India Muslim League, founded in 1906, initially supported the Partition of Bengal.
2.  Nawab Salimullah of Dacca played a crucial role in encouraging the formation of the All-India Muslim League.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The All-India Muslim League's stance on the Partition of Bengal was complex and evolved over time.  Initially, the League's position was not uniform. While some sections within the League welcomed the partition as a potential benefit to Muslim interests in East Bengal, others opposed it.  The initial focus of the League was more on securing separate electorates and safeguarding Muslim interests within the existing political framework. The statement that the League initially *supported* the partition is an oversimplification and inaccurate.  Conversely, Nawab Salimullah of Dacca was a key figure in the League's early years. His influence and support were instrumental in its formation and early development.  He represented a powerful voice within the Muslim community, and his backing contributed significantly to the League's establishment and initial success. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect while statement 2 accurately reflects a key element in the League's origins.


**3. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swadeshi Movement solely focused on boycotting British goods and promoting indigenous industries.
2. The Partition of Bengal directly triggered the Swadeshi Movement as a primary response.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Swadeshi Movement was a multifaceted campaign that went beyond simply boycotting British goods. While the boycott was a central element, the movement also encompassed broader aims, including promoting self-reliance, reviving indigenous industries and crafts, and fostering a sense of national identity.  The movement's goals were intertwined with the larger nationalist aspirations of the time.  Therefore, statement 1 is an oversimplification that fails to capture the movement's complexity. The Partition of Bengal served as a catalyst for the Swadeshi Movement, but it wasn't the sole cause. Pre-existing nationalist sentiments and growing discontent with British rule already laid the groundwork for a mass movement. The partition acted as a powerful trigger, unifying diverse groups in opposition to what was perceived as an unjust and divisive policy.  However, to state that it was the *primary* response is an overstatement, ignoring the underlying factors that fueled the movement's momentum.  Thus, both statements are partially true but inaccurate in their entirety.


**4. With reference to the Provisional Government of India in Kabul, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Provisional Government was formed solely by Indian revolutionaries seeking refuge in Kabul.
2.  Maulana Barkat Ullah and Maulana Obeidullah Sindhi were the only key figures involved in its formation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Provisional Government of India in Kabul was a complex entity formed during World War I. While it did consist primarily of Indian revolutionaries who had sought refuge in Afghanistan, it's inaccurate to say it was *solely* composed of such individuals.  The government's formation involved interactions with Afghan authorities and other political actors, reflecting the geopolitical context of the time. The government's existence was also influenced by the broader anti-colonial sentiments prevalent in the region.  Therefore, statement 1 presents an incomplete picture.  Similarly, statement 2 is incorrect.  While Maulana Barkat Ullah and Maulana Obeidullah Sindhi were prominent leaders of the Provisional Government, other significant figures were also involved in its establishment and functioning.  The government's leadership was more diverse than the statement suggests, reflecting the varied revolutionary groups and individuals seeking independence.  Hence, both statements are oversimplifications and do not fully represent the historical reality.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act introduced a system of provincial autonomy with significant legislative powers transferred to provincial legislatures.
2. The Act completely abolished the system of separate electorates for minority communities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act 1935 was a landmark piece of legislation that significantly restructured the Indian political system.  A key feature was the introduction of provincial autonomy, granting substantial legislative powers to the elected provincial assemblies.  This represented a substantial step towards self-governance at the provincial level and marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the British government and Indian political entities. Therefore, statement 1 accurately reflects a core element of the Act.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act did *not* completely abolish separate electorates. While it provided for joint electorates in some contexts, it also retained the system of separate electorates for minority communities, including Muslims,  in certain provinces. This provision, a legacy of earlier legislation, continued to be a source of contention and division within Indian politics.  The continued existence of separate electorates under the 1935 Act highlights the complexities of managing communal relations and the cautious approach adopted by the British government.


**6.  With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's initial success was largely due to the widespread participation of the upper-caste Hindus.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident directly led to the movement's immediate and complete suspension by Mahatma Gandhi.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement's initial success stemmed from a broad-based participation that included various segments of Indian society, notably peasants, students, and middle-class Indians from diverse backgrounds, including both upper and lower castes. While upper-caste Hindus were involved, it's an oversimplification to attribute the movement's success primarily to their participation, overlooking the crucial role of other groups.  Therefore, statement 1 is an inaccurate simplification. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in deaths, proved to be a turning point for Gandhi.  He saw this incident as a clear indication that the movement was veering towards widespread violence, undermining the principle of non-violent resistance that was central to his philosophy.  Gandhi's response was immediate and decisive, leading to the suspension of the movement.  However, it is important to note that the withdrawal wasn't a complete and immediate end to all activities but a strategic decision to halt the mass civil disobedience aspect of the movement.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct, highlighting Gandhi’s commitment to non-violence and his pragmatic approach to managing a mass movement.


**7. With reference to the Home Rule Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Both Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant's Home Rule Leagues operated independently with distinct organizational structures.
2. The primary demand of the Home Rule Movement was the immediate grant of complete independence to India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Home Rule Movement, launched during World War I, witnessed the establishment of two separate leagues, one led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and the other by Annie Besant.  While both shared the common goal of achieving self-government for India, they operated independently, with distinct organizational structures and strategies, reflecting the diverse leadership within the nationalist movement.  Therefore, statement 1 is a correct assertion about the organizational aspect of the movement. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Home Rule Movement did not explicitly demand immediate complete independence. While the ultimate aim was self-rule, the Leagues' approach was more gradual and sought to achieve this through constitutional means, leveraging the political climate of the war years. The demand was for dominion status, equivalent to that of other self-governing British dominions, within the framework of the British Empire.  The Leagues’ strategy focused on raising public awareness and putting pressure on the British government to grant greater self-rule after the war.  The emphasis was on constitutional agitation rather than immediate and complete independence.


**8. With reference to the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, consider the following statements:**

1.  The massacre took place during a peaceful gathering protesting against the Rowlatt Act.
2. The Hunter Committee's report fully exonerated General Dyer of any wrongdoing in the massacre.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, a horrific event in Indian history, occurred during a peaceful gathering in Amritsar.  The gathering, largely composed of unarmed civilians, had assembled to protest against the repressive Rowlatt Act, which allowed for detention without trial.  The event is remembered as a stark example of British brutality and ruthlessness in suppressing dissent. Therefore, statement 1 is a correct description of the event's context. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hunter Committee, appointed to investigate the massacre, did *not* fully exonerate General Dyer.  While the committee's report was widely criticized for its biased nature and failure to adequately address the severity of the event, it did not fully clear Dyer of wrongdoing.  The report generated considerable controversy, with many believing it downplayed Dyer's culpability and failed to hold him accountable for the excessive use of force. The report's findings, rather than exonerating Dyer, further fueled the anger and resentment towards British rule, highlighting the government's failure to address the atrocity in a just and transparent manner.

**1. With reference to the Indian National Congress's early years (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress initially focused solely on constitutional methods, advocating for reforms through petitions and peaceful demonstrations, and largely avoided direct confrontation with the British government.
2.  The early Congress leadership, predominantly composed of moderates,  explicitly professed loyalty to British rule while simultaneously pushing for greater Indian autonomy within the existing framework.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905) is characterized by the dominance of moderate nationalists.  Statement 1 accurately reflects their primary approach.  The Moderates believed in constitutional methods—utilizing petitions, public meetings, and resolutions to pressure the British government for gradual reforms.  Direct confrontation was largely avoided in this initial phase, as the Moderates aimed for incremental progress within the existing political system.  This strategy was based on a belief that the British were ultimately receptive to reasoned argument and the gradual expansion of Indian self-governance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While undeniably patriots seeking greater Indian control, the early Congress leaders often expressed loyalty to the British Crown and the existing political order. This wasn't necessarily a sign of weakness or lack of conviction; rather, it reflected a pragmatic approach.  They believed that demonstrating loyalty while simultaneously advocating for reform was a more effective strategy than outright defiance, which could potentially lead to harsher repression.  Their hope was to persuade the British government through reasoned argument and a demonstration of responsible behavior that gradual self-rule was in the best interests of both India and Britain.  The professions of loyalty were thus strategic tools within a broader framework of achieving independence.  The later shift towards more assertive and militant nationalism demonstrated a change in strategy as the early approach proved less effective.


**2. With reference to the Ilbert Bill, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ilbert Bill, introduced by Lord Ripon, aimed to grant Indian judges the authority to try European offenders, a move that sparked significant opposition from the European community in India.
2.  The initial version of the Ilbert Bill faced strong resistance, leading to its modification before its final enactment, resulting in a compromise that partially addressed the concerns raised by the European community.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ilbert Bill, introduced by Lord Ripon in 1883, aimed to remove the existing racial discrimination in the Indian judicial system.  Statement 1 accurately describes the bill's core objective: to empower Indian judges to try European British citizens for certain offenses. This was a significant challenge to the existing system, which favored European officials.  The proposed change triggered a strong backlash from the European community in India, who viewed it as a threat to their privileged status and feared potential bias in the judicial process.  Their opposition played a crucial role in shaping the bill's subsequent trajectory.

Statement 2 is also correct, as the intense opposition led to significant modifications to the original bill.  The British government, facing pressure from the European community, conceded several points. The final version of the Ilbert Bill represented a compromise, although it still represented a step towards greater equality in the judicial system.  The modifications, however, did not completely eliminate the concerns of the European community, showing the complexities of navigating racial tensions within the colonial administration. This event highlights the limitations of even well-intentioned reforms within a deeply unequal colonial context.


**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the death of policemen, directly led to Mahatma Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement.
2.  The Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of the Ottoman Caliph after World War I, served as a major catalyst for the Non-Cooperation Movement, uniting Hindus and Muslims in a common cause against British rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, was a pivotal moment in India's struggle for independence. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Chauri Chaura incident as a crucial turning point.  The violence that erupted in Chauri Chaura, in which protestors set fire to a police station, killing several policemen, deeply disturbed Mahatma Gandhi.  He believed that the incident demonstrated a failure to uphold the principle of non-violence central to the movement.  This event, although a relatively small incident in the larger context of the movement, became a symbolic representation of the potential for the movement to devolve into violence and thus prompted Gandhi to call for a suspension of the movement, highlighting the importance he placed on non-violent methods.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The Khilafat issue, concerning the post-World War I fate of the Ottoman Caliph and the Ottoman Empire, played a significant role in galvanizing support for the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Indian Muslims, who viewed the Ottoman Caliph as their religious leader, were deeply concerned by the Allied powers' treatment of Turkey and the Caliphate.  This resonated deeply with many Indian Muslims, and the shared concern over the Khilafat issue helped forge a powerful alliance between Hindu and Muslim nationalists, creating a broader and more unified front against British rule. The movement's success was partly due to this unprecedented Hindu-Muslim unity, showing the power of shared grievances in mobilizing a mass movement. The eventual decline of the Khilafat issue later weakened the movement.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Congress and its early leaders, consider the following statements:**

1. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent leader of the Congress, advocated for self-government for India through constitutional means, emphasizing gradual and peaceful reforms.
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, representing the more militant wing of the Congress, championed the cause of Swaraj, but differed from Gokhale in his approach, employing more assertive and occasionally extra-constitutional methods.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Bal Gangadhar Tilak represent two distinct, yet influential, strands of early Indian nationalism within the Congress.  Statement 1 accurately portrays Gokhale's ideology and political strategy.  A leading figure among the Congress moderates, Gokhale believed in achieving self-government through constitutional means, working within the existing political system. His approach emphasized gradual and peaceful reforms, relying on reasoned argument, petitions, and collaboration with sympathetic elements within the British administration.  He advocated for slow, incremental progress, believing that this was the most effective path to achieving Indian autonomy.

Statement 2 also correctly describes Tilak's stance.  Tilak, a prominent leader of the more militant nationalist faction, also advocated for Swaraj (self-rule), but his methods differed significantly from Gokhale's.  While both shared the ultimate goal of Indian independence, Tilak believed that more assertive, and at times extra-constitutional, methods were necessary. This included mobilizing mass support through festivals and public celebrations, and challenging British authority more directly.  Their differing approaches highlight the internal debates and evolving strategies within the early Congress, reflecting the diversity of opinions and approaches within the nationalist movement.  The contrasting approaches of Gokhale and Tilak shaped the trajectory of the Indian National Congress and the broader nationalist movement.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Constituent Assembly of India:**

1. The Constituent Assembly was formed solely based on the recommendations of the Cabinet Mission Plan, without any prior groundwork or discussions.
2.  The Constituent Assembly's composition reflected the diverse political landscape of India at the time, including representatives from various provinces, communities, and political parties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Constituent Assembly of India, responsible for drafting the Indian Constitution, was a complex political body whose formation and composition reflected the political climate of the time.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The formation of the Constituent Assembly wasn't a sudden event based solely on the Cabinet Mission Plan.  While the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946 played a crucial role in defining the structure and process, the idea of a Constituent Assembly had been discussed and advocated for by Indian nationalists for years. The demand for such a body to frame a constitution for India had been a long-standing goal of the Indian National Congress and other political organizations.  The Cabinet Mission Plan provided a framework for its creation, but it was not the sole determinant of its formation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constituent Assembly's composition was indeed diverse, reflecting the multifaceted nature of Indian society and politics.  It included representatives from various provinces of British India, representing different regions and regional interests.  It also included members from different communities, aiming for representation of various religious and ethnic groups.  Moreover, the Assembly included members from various political parties, including the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League (initially), and other smaller parties.  This diversity, while sometimes leading to tensions and disagreements, was essential in creating a constitution that aimed to represent the interests of all Indians. The participation of various political groups, however, was not uniform and several groups boycotted it.

**1. With reference to the early years of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address to the Congress,  articulated the "Drain of Wealth" theory, highlighting the economic exploitation of India under British rule.  He argued that the British system drained India's resources systematically, impoverishing its populace.
2.  The Congress, during this period, primarily focused on constitutional methods of agitation, such as petitions and lobbying, to achieve its goals, largely eschewing mass movements and direct confrontation with the British authorities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the early Indian National Congress.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Dadabhai Naoroji's significant contribution to the nationalist movement.  Naoroji, a prominent Parsi leader and three-time Congress president, forcefully presented the "Drain of Wealth" theory, arguing that British policies systematically extracted India's wealth, leading to widespread poverty and hindering economic development. This theory became a cornerstone of the Congress's economic critique of British rule.

Statement 2 also reflects the Congress's approach during its moderate phase.  The early nationalists, often referred to as "Moderates," primarily employed constitutional methods of political engagement. They believed in working within the existing system, utilizing petitions, resolutions, and participation in legislative councils (though these councils had limited powers) to press for reforms and a greater Indian voice in governance.  While there were instances of localized protests and boycotts, the dominant strategy was one of reasoned argument and engagement with the British government, rather than mass civil disobedience or armed rebellion.  This approach reflected a strategic calculation to avoid direct confrontation that might lead to harsh repression by the colonial authorities, prioritizing gradual progress over immediate, potentially risky, action.  The Moderates believed that gradual reforms were the most effective and sustainable path towards self-governance.


**2.  With reference to the political ideologies of Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha, emphasizing non-violent resistance, was fundamentally incompatible with Bose's belief in the necessity of armed struggle to achieve India's independence.  Gandhi's approach prioritized moral suasion and peaceful means, whereas Bose believed that forceful resistance was sometimes necessary to counter colonial oppression.
2.  Both Gandhi and Bose advocated for a socialist economic model for independent India, although they differed on the specific means of achieving this goal. While Gandhi envisioned a decentralized, village-based economy, Bose favoured rapid industrialization and state-led economic planning.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately capture key differences and similarities in the approaches of Gandhi and Bose.  Statement 1 highlights a crucial divergence in their strategies for national liberation. Gandhi's unwavering commitment to Satyagraha, a philosophy of non-violent resistance, formed the cornerstone of his political thought and action.  He believed that non-violence was not merely a tactic but a moral imperative, capable of transforming both the oppressor and the oppressed. In contrast, Bose, while initially supportive of Gandhi's methods, eventually concluded that armed struggle was necessary to secure complete independence.  This divergence stemmed from differing assessments of the British government's willingness to negotiate and the effectiveness of non-violent resistance in achieving the ultimate goal of independence.

Statement 2 correctly points to a shared, yet nuanced, commitment to socialist ideals.  While both leaders were critical of capitalist exploitation and desired an economically just India, they held contrasting visions for the post-independence economy. Gandhi's vision of a decentralized, village-based economy emphasized self-sufficiency, rural development, and traditional crafts.  He advocated for a simple life, minimizing material wants and prioritizing social harmony.  Bose, on the other hand, believed in rapid industrialization and state-led economic planning as essential for India's progress and ability to compete on the global stage.  His vision was more closely aligned with a centralized, state-controlled socialist model inspired by the Soviet Union's experience.  This fundamental difference in their economic perspectives reflected differing views on the role of the state, technology, and modernization in nation-building.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance to the provinces, but retained substantial control at the central level, particularly in matters of defense and foreign affairs.  The governor-general still held considerable power, acting as a safeguard against what the British perceived as potential instability.
2.  The Act established a bicameral legislature at the federal level, comprising a Council of States (upper house) and a Federal Assembly (lower house), with a system of indirect elections for the Federal Assembly, which was designed to ensure a balance between representation and colonial control.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a central feature of the Government of India Act of 1935: the introduction of provincial autonomy.  The Act did indeed grant provinces a significant degree of self-governance, replacing the earlier system of dyarchy (dual governance).  However, the central government retained control over key areas like defense, foreign affairs, and certain aspects of law and order, reflecting the British government's reluctance to relinquish complete control. The governor-general's position was strengthened with extensive "special responsibilities" and powers to intervene in provincial affairs if deemed necessary for maintaining order and British interests.  This carefully balanced arrangement aimed to provide a measure of self-rule while preserving the ultimate authority of the British Crown.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Act did indeed establish a bicameral legislature at the federal level (Council of States and Federal Assembly), the system of elections was more complex than stated.  The Council of States had a mixed composition of directly elected members from provinces and nominated members from princely states. The Federal Assembly, while aiming for broader representation, employed a system of indirect elections through provincial legislatures, weighted based on population. However, the description in statement 2 is simplistic and doesn't accurately reflect the complexity of the electoral system, which was designed to ensure a degree of British control. The system of indirect elections was intended to limit the direct influence of the popular vote on the central government.


**4. With reference to the Cripps Mission and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission's proposal for a constituent assembly to frame India's future constitution was accepted by the Congress, despite reservations about some aspects of the plan, particularly the option for provinces to secede and the retention of the Governor-General's powers.
2. The failure of the Cripps Mission, coupled with the increasing threat of Japanese invasion, contributed significantly to the intensification of the Indian independence movement and the eventual launching of the Quit India Movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Although the Cripps Mission did propose a constituent assembly, the Congress ultimately rejected the entire proposal. While the idea of a constituent assembly was a significant concession, the Congress found several other aspects unacceptable, including the offer of dominion status instead of complete independence, the provision allowing provinces to secede (which was seen as a threat to national unity), and the retention of substantial powers by the Governor-General. These concerns, coupled with the perceived lack of sincerity in the British government's offer, led to the Congress's rejection. The Congress's demand was for immediate independence and not dominion status.

Statement 2 is correct. The failure of the Cripps Mission was a pivotal moment in the Indian independence movement. The mission's collapse, coupled with the escalating threat of a Japanese invasion of India, created a sense of urgency and heightened nationalist sentiment.  The perceived betrayal by the British government fueled widespread disillusionment and anger, creating a fertile ground for a more assertive and radical approach to the struggle for independence.  This contributed directly to the launching of the Quit India Movement in 1942, a mass civil disobedience movement that marked a significant escalation in the fight for freedom. The Quit India Movement was a spontaneous and widespread movement.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian National Army (INA) and its leader Subhas Chandra Bose:**

1.  The INA, formed by Subhas Chandra Bose with the support of the Axis powers during World War II, comprised soldiers primarily from the Indian diaspora residing in Southeast Asia.  The INA aimed to liberate India from British rule through armed struggle.
2.  Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers, particularly Japan, was driven primarily by his ideological affinity with their fascist ideologies and not merely by a pragmatic assessment of the strategic situation.  This collaboration caused considerable controversy even within the ranks of the Indian independence movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The INA, led by Subhas Chandra Bose, was indeed formed during World War II with the support of the Axis powers, particularly Japan.  The army primarily comprised Indian soldiers from the diaspora communities in Southeast Asia, many of whom had been living under Japanese occupation. Bose saw an opportunity to utilize this situation to launch an armed struggle against the British. The INA's aim was to liberate India through military action, albeit with support from a foreign power. The statement is not entirely correct because some Indian soldiers from within India also joined the INA.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers was undeniably controversial, it is inaccurate to characterize it as primarily driven by ideological affinity with fascism. While Bose was impressed by the discipline and organization of the Axis powers, his primary motivation was strategic. He saw the weakening of Britain due to the war as a unique opportunity to launch a concerted effort to gain independence. The collaboration was a matter of pragmatic expediency, aimed at leveraging the Axis powers’ resources and military capabilities to undermine British rule.  His association with the Axis powers was a complex and controversial aspect of his leadership, debated even within the nationalist movement.  It is important to note that he was not a supporter of fascism.  While he admired their discipline, he was against fascism’s ideology of racial superiority.

**1. With reference to the Home Rule Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's Home Rule League primarily focused on mobilizing support in Maharashtra and other parts of Western India, employing methods that included Ganapati and Shivaji festivals for political mobilization.
2.  Annie Besant's Home Rule League concentrated its efforts in South India, advocating for self-governance through constitutional means and emphasizing cooperation with the existing political structures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect distinct aspects of the Home Rule Movement.  The movement, while aiming for self-governance (Swaraj), manifested in two separate leagues led by prominent figures with differing approaches.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's league, established in 1916, indeed focused on the western region of India, particularly Maharashtra.  His strategy cleverly integrated cultural and religious festivals, like the Ganapati and Shivaji festivals, to galvanize mass support and subtly convey political messages, bypassing direct confrontation with the British authorities. This was a significant departure from purely constitutional methods.  Conversely, Annie Besant, initiating her Home Rule League in 1916, concentrated her efforts in South India.  While also seeking Swaraj, her approach leaned more towards constitutional activism, seeking to work within the existing political framework to achieve gradual self-rule.  The simultaneous existence of these two leagues, each with its own geographical focus and strategic approach, highlights the diversity of tactics employed within the broader Home Rule Movement.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they present each league's activities in isolation, ignoring the parallel and complementary nature of their contributions. Option (d) is incorrect as both leagues were integral parts of the Home Rule Movement.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement:**

1.  The movement's initial success was largely attributed to Mahatma Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance, attracting widespread participation from diverse social groups including peasants, students, and urban professionals.  The movement saw participation from all classes including the elite and the underprivileged.
2.  The movement's eventual decline can be primarily attributed to the Chauri Chaura incident, which involved violence against the police, leading to Gandhi's suspension of the movement and a subsequent loss of momentum.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly identify crucial phases of the Non-Cooperation Movement. The initial success of the movement (launched in 1920) was undeniably linked to Gandhi's leadership and his advocacy of Satyagraha—non-violent civil disobedience.  This approach resonated deeply with a wide cross-section of Indian society, transcending class and regional boundaries.  Peasants, students, and urban professionals, along with many members of the elite, actively participated in boycotts of British goods, institutions, and services.  However, the movement's trajectory was significantly altered by the Chauri Chaura incident in 1922, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the latter's deaths.  Gandhi, deeply committed to non-violence, responded by suspending the movement.  This decision, while motivated by his principled stand against violence, led to a significant loss of momentum and ultimately contributed to the movement's decline.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they present only a partial picture of the movement's complex evolution. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements represent accurate and significant aspects of the Non-Cooperation Movement's history.


**3. With reference to the Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms), consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms introduced a system of separate electorates, granting Muslims representation in excess of their numerical proportion in legislative councils, a move that ultimately exacerbated communal divisions within Indian politics.
2.  While increasing the number of elected members in legislative councils, the reforms maintained indirect elections, limiting the direct influence of the Indian populace on the composition of these councils.  The number of elected members were increased significantly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key features of the Morley-Minto Reforms.  The Act of 1909, designed partly to appease moderate nationalists and Muslim leaders, introduced a controversial system of separate electorates for Muslims.  This meant that Muslim representatives were elected solely by Muslim voters, a provision intended to secure their representation but that ultimately deepened communal divisions and hindered the development of a unified Indian nationalist movement.  The separate electorates also granted Muslims representation exceeding their population percentage, a further factor contributing to political fragmentation. The reforms, while expanding the number of elected members in legislative councils, retained the system of indirect elections.  This meant that voters did not directly elect representatives to the central and provincial councils; instead, the process involved multiple layers of electoral colleges. This significantly limited the direct influence of the Indian population on the composition of the councils and maintained a degree of British control over the legislative process. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete representations of the reforms. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements reflect accurate aspects of the Indian Councils Act of 1909.


**4. With reference to the activities of Lala Lajpat Rai, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, actively participated in the Home Rule Movement, advocating for complete independence from British rule and employing methods of both constitutional and extra-constitutional agitation.
2.  Lala Lajpat Rai played a crucial role in the establishment of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), contributing significantly to the growth of the Indian labour movement and its articulation of socio-economic grievances within the broader context of the freedom struggle.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of Lala Lajpat Rai's multifaceted contributions to the Indian freedom struggle.  Lala Lajpat Rai was a significant figure in the Indian National Congress, actively involved in the Home Rule Movement.  He was a strong advocate for Swaraj, although his vision of complete independence might have been nuanced. His methods involved both constitutional means, such as participation in legislative councils, and extra-constitutional strategies like public agitation and mobilization.   He was also a key figure in the development of the Indian labour movement.  Lala Lajpat Rai played a pivotal role in the founding of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), a crucial organization in organizing and representing Indian workers.  His involvement in the AITUC reflects his understanding of the interconnectedness of socio-economic and political liberation and demonstrates his commitment to addressing the grievances of the working class within the broader struggle for Indian independence. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete and fail to acknowledge the breadth of his influence. Option (d) is incorrect because both aspects of his career are well-documented.


**5. Consider the following statements about the impact of the First World War on India:**

1. The war effort led to a significant increase in India's industrial output, particularly in areas like textiles and munitions, and a rise in the number of industrial workers, however, this growth was accompanied by poor working conditions and exploitation.
2. The war also caused widespread economic hardship in India, including severe inflation and food shortages, leading to increased social unrest and popular dissatisfaction with British rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The First World War had a profound and paradoxical impact on India, simultaneously boosting industrial production while exacerbating existing economic hardships.  The war effort created a surge in demand for various goods, particularly textiles and munitions, leading to an expansion of Indian industries. This resulted in a growth in the industrial workforce. However, this industrial expansion was largely uncontrolled and exploitative, characterized by poor working conditions, low wages, and long working hours.  The war also brought about widespread economic difficulties in India.  The increased demand for resources led to severe inflation, impacting the cost of essential goods.  Simultaneously, disruptions in food supply chains resulted in widespread food shortages, particularly in rural areas.  These economic hardships contributed to increased social unrest and fueled existing dissatisfaction with British rule, creating a fertile ground for the rise of nationalist movements. Options (a) and (b) provide only a partial view of the complex consequences. Option (d) is incorrect because the war demonstrably had both positive and negative effects on the Indian economy and society.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's knowledge base.


**1. With reference to the Nehru Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nehru Report advocated for a unitary, rather than a federal, system of government for India.
2.  The Nehru Report explicitly rejected the concept of separate electorates for religious minorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928 by Motilal Nehru and other Congress leaders, proposed a dominion status for India within the British Commonwealth.  While it did suggest a federal structure with provinces having significant autonomy, statement 1 is incorrect. The report primarily envisioned a strong central government with substantial powers, deviating from a purely federal model.  However, statement 2 is entirely accurate.  The Nehru Report vehemently opposed the principle of separate electorates, arguing that it fostered communal division and hindered national unity.  It advocated for joint electorates with safeguards for minority representation within a unified electoral system.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the report's stance on either the federal structure or the issue of separate electorates, or both.  The Nehru Report's rejection of separate electorates was a key point of contention with the Muslim League, ultimately highlighting the growing chasm between Hindu and Muslim political aspirations.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of the Khilafat Movement:**

1. The Moplah Rebellion in Malabar, though initially unrelated, became intertwined with the Khilafat Movement, escalating its intensity and complexity.
2.  The Khilafat Movement's success in achieving its primary goal of protecting the Ottoman Caliphate significantly strengthened Hindu-Muslim unity in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Khilafat Movement, launched in the early 1920s to defend the Ottoman Caliphate, initially enjoyed widespread support from both Hindus and Muslims, reflecting a period of significant inter-religious cooperation. Statement 1 correctly reflects a crucial aspect of the movement's evolution. The Moplah Rebellion in Malabar, while initially a separate agrarian uprising, became associated with the Khilafat Movement, exacerbating communal tensions and ultimately undermining the initial Hindu-Muslim unity.  However, statement 2 is inaccurate. The Khilafat Movement ultimately failed in its central objective of saving the Ottoman Caliphate. This failure, along with the violence associated with events like the Moplah Rebellion, significantly eroded the initial Hindu-Muslim unity that had characterized the movement's early stages.  The other options are incorrect as they misinterpret the relationship between the Moplah Rebellion and the Khilafat Movement, or the movement’s overall impact on Hindu-Muslim relations.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation that included both British Indian provinces and princely states, becoming fully operational immediately upon its enactment.
2.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier diarchy system, but retained significant powers for the Governor in each province.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 was a landmark piece of legislation that significantly reshaped the Indian political landscape. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act did *propose* an All-India Federation encompassing British Indian provinces and princely states,  this crucial component never materialized due to the failure to meet the stipulated conditions for princely state participation.  The central government continued to operate under the provisions of the 1919 Act until 1946.  Statement 2, however, accurately reflects the Act's impact on provincial governance. Provincial autonomy replaced the earlier diarchy system, granting provinces greater self-rule.  However, the Act carefully preserved substantial powers for the Governor in each province, allowing them to intervene in matters concerning law and order, minority rights, and other key areas, essentially acting as a check on provincial autonomy.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the fate of the proposed federation or the extent of provincial autonomy granted under the Act.


**4. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the Indian National Congress after the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Jawaharlal Nehru strongly advocated for a "struggle-truce-struggle" strategy, emphasizing periodic mass movements interspersed with periods of negotiation and respite.
2.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance in the provincial legislatures under the Government of India Act of 1935, but eventually conceded to a trial run of Congress ministries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The period following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement witnessed intense debate within the Congress regarding its future course of action. Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nehru was a staunch critic of the "struggle-truce-struggle" (S-T-S) strategy, arguing for a more continuous and sustained confrontation with British imperialism.  He believed that periodic lulls weakened the movement's momentum and allowed the British to regroup.  He advocated for a "struggle-victory" (S-V) approach.  Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi, initially skeptical of participating in the provincial legislatures under the 1935 Act, eventually agreed to a trial run of Congress ministries. This decision, while controversial, was a strategic move to demonstrate the Congress's commitment to governance while simultaneously working to expose the limitations of the Act. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the positions of Nehru and Gandhi concerning the S-T-S strategy and the issue of office acceptance.


**5. With reference to the activities of  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, consider the following statements:**

1. Tilak's newspaper, *Kesari*, primarily focused on promoting moderate political reforms and advocating for cooperation with the British government.
2.  Tilak's Ganapati and Shivaji festivals were primarily religious celebrations with minimal political significance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement known for his nationalist and often radical views. Statement 1 is incorrect. Tilak's *Kesari*, along with *Mahratta*, served as powerful platforms for articulating nationalist views and mobilizing public opinion against British rule.  His writings often advocated for assertive political action and challenged the moderate approach. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While seemingly religious celebrations, Tilak’s Ganapati and Shivaji festivals played a pivotal role in fostering a sense of Indian nationalism and challenging British authority. The festivals became powerful tools for mass mobilization and the articulation of anti-colonial sentiments.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the nature and purpose of Tilak's publications and his use of religious festivals for political mobilization.


**6. Consider the following statements about religious reform movements in 19th and 20th century India:**

1. The Brahmo Samaj, primarily focused on reforming Hindu religious practices, actively supported the complete abolition of caste system.
2. The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, strongly advocated for the revival of Vedic traditions and opposed the influence of Western education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 19th and 20th centuries witnessed a surge in religious reform movements in India, aiming to address social and religious issues within existing religious frameworks. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Brahmo Samaj, spearheaded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, significantly contributed to religious reform in India, it aimed to purify Hinduism, not completely abolish the caste system.  While it advocated for social reforms, the complete abolition of caste was not its central goal. Statement 2 is correct. Swami Dayanand Saraswati's Arya Samaj emphasized a return to Vedic principles and often critiqued the acceptance of Western ideas and practices within Indian society. The Arya Samaj actively sought to revive and reinforce traditional Hindu values and practices. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the reform agendas of the Brahmo Samaj and the Arya Samaj.


**7. With reference to the views of Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi consistently advocated for complete separation of religious and political spheres, believing that religious beliefs should not influence political actions.
2. Gandhi championed Khadi as a symbol of self-reliance and the dignity of labor, advocating for its adoption to uplift India's rural economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy and political actions were deeply rooted in his religious beliefs and ethical principles. Statement 1 is incorrect. Gandhi's approach was characterized by a close interconnection between his religious beliefs and his political actions. His philosophy of Satyagraha, for instance, was deeply intertwined with his spiritual beliefs, highlighting the inseparable nature of his religious and political perspectives. Statement 2 accurately captures a key element of Gandhi's socio-economic vision.  He promoted Khadi not merely as a symbol of self-reliance but also as a means to uplift India's rural economy by reviving traditional crafts and providing employment opportunities.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent Gandhi's views on the relationship between religion and politics, or his promotion of Khadi.


**8. With reference to the activities of Bhagat Singh, consider the following statements:**

1. Bhagat Singh's revolutionary activities were primarily focused on assassinating key British officials, with little emphasis on broader political goals or social reform.
2.  Bhagat Singh was a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), a revolutionary group advocating for socialist ideals and complete independence for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bhagat Singh was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement, known for his revolutionary ideals and socialist leanings.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bhagat Singh was involved in the assassination of John Saunders, his revolutionary activities extended beyond individual acts of violence.  He had a broader vision that incorporated socialist ideals, social reform, and the establishment of a truly independent India.  Statement 2 is accurate. Bhagat Singh was a leading member of the HSRA, a group that advocated for socialist principles, complete independence, and societal transformation. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope of Bhagat Singh's revolutionary activities or his association with the HSRA.


**9. With reference to the Permanent Settlement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, implemented by Lord Cornwallis, aimed to establish a stable system of land revenue collection but unintentionally led to the impoverishment of many peasants.
2. The Permanent Settlement was uniformly applied across all regions of British India, creating a consistent land revenue system throughout the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Permanent Settlement was a significant land revenue policy implemented by the British in India. Statement 1 is correct. Lord Cornwallis introduced the Permanent Settlement, aiming for a predictable and stable revenue system. However, this policy inadvertently led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few Zamindars, resulting in the exploitation and impoverishment of many peasants.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement was not uniformly implemented across all regions of British India. Different revenue systems, such as the Ryotwari and Mahalwari systems, were adopted in other parts of the country based on local conditions. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the consequences of the Permanent Settlement or its geographical application.


**10.  Consider the following statements regarding Dadabhai Naoroji:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji was the first Indian to be elected to the British Parliament, significantly contributing to raising Indian issues on the world stage.
2. Dadabhai Naoroji’s "Drain of Wealth" theory argued that British rule benefited India economically by facilitating the transfer of capital and technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji was a pioneer of Indian nationalism and a key figure in the early phases of the independence movement. Statement 1 is correct.  Naoroji was the first Indian to be elected to the British House of Commons in 1892, using this platform to advocate for Indian self-rule and highlight the injustices of British rule. Statement 2 is incorrect. Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory posited that British rule systematically extracted wealth from India, hindering its economic development. He argued that this transfer of resources to Britain impoverished India and prevented its economic progress.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent Naoroji's role in British politics or his economic analysis of British rule.

**1. With reference to the Indian National Congress' early years (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress's initial focus was primarily on securing complete independence for India, employing methods of mass civil disobedience from its inception.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, during his three terms as Congress President, consistently advocated for self-government modeled after self-governing British colonies, while simultaneously critiquing the "drain of wealth" from India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian National Congress's early years (1885-1905), often referred to as the Moderate phase, were characterized by a more gradual and constitutional approach to achieving political reforms.  The primary focus was on gaining a larger share in the governance of India through constitutional means, such as petitions, appeals, and participation in legislative councils. Mass civil disobedience and the demand for complete independence emerged later in the nationalist movement. The early nationalists, while patriotic, prioritized working within the existing system to gradually achieve their goals, fearing immediate and forceful suppression by the British government.  Their methods involved lobbying the British government and public opinion, advocating for reforms within the existing framework, and building a sense of national unity.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent leader of the early Congress, served three terms as President. His contributions were significant in establishing the Congress's platform and shaping its early strategy.  He is famously associated with the "drain of wealth" theory, which highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule.  Furthermore,  towards the end of the Moderate phase, the Congress began advocating for self-government, inspired by the example of self-governing colonies within the British Empire, a demand explicitly made by Naoroji and other leaders. This reflects a shift towards greater autonomy within the Empire, not complete independence, which was a later goal.


**2. With reference to the activities of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The HSRA's primary objective was the establishment of a capitalist state in India, achieved through a series of targeted assassinations of key British officials.
2.  Bhagat Singh's participation in the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929 was intended as a symbolic act of protest, utilizing the subsequent trial to propagate the HSRA's ideology.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HSRA, a prominent revolutionary organization, was explicitly socialist in its ideology and aimed to establish a socialist, not capitalist, state in India. While the HSRA did engage in acts of violence, including assassinations, these were not their sole focus and were often strategically employed to generate publicity and awareness for their cause. Their ultimate goal was a broader societal transformation, not merely the removal of individual British officials.  The HSRA's actions should be understood within the context of the intense political climate and the limitations faced by revolutionary groups in India at the time.

Statement 2 is correct. Bhagat Singh's participation in the Central Legislative Assembly bombing was a calculated move designed to garner attention and spread the HSRA's message. The bombs used were designed to be non-lethal, prioritizing the act of protest and the subsequent trial as a platform to articulate their political and economic demands. This strategy highlights the HSRA's understanding of propaganda and the utilization of various platforms to communicate their ideology to a wider audience. The event and its aftermath significantly contributed to the growth of revolutionary nationalist sentiment and influenced the future trajectory of the Indian independence movement.


**3. With reference to the Cripps Mission of 1942, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cripps Mission's proposals were unanimously accepted by all major Indian political parties, paving the way for immediate Indian independence.
2.  The mission's offer of a dominion status for India, with the option for provinces to secede and form separate unions, was a key point of contention among Indian nationalists.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission's proposals were not unanimously accepted.  The mission failed to secure the support of major Indian political parties, primarily the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League.  The Congress rejected the proposals due to several key issues, including the offer of dominion status (rather than complete independence), the provision for provincial secession (which threatened national unity), and the lack of immediate transfer of power. The Muslim League also expressed reservations, primarily concerning the lack of explicit provisions for the creation of Pakistan. The failure of the Cripps Mission marked a significant turning point, escalating tensions between Indian nationalists and the British government and ultimately contributing to the events leading up to the Partition of India.

Statement 2 is correct. The offer of dominion status, coupled with the option for provinces to secede and form separate unions, was a major point of contention.  The provision for secession, while intended to address concerns of various groups, was seen by many Indian nationalists as a threat to national unity and a potential recipe for the fragmentation of India. This aspect of the proposals fueled disagreements and ultimately contributed to the mission's failure to achieve its objective of securing Indian cooperation in the ongoing Second World War.  The potential for the division of India was a serious concern for many, highlighting the complexities of the political situation at the time.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905):**

1.  The Indian National Congress, from its inception, actively promoted the use of violence as a means of achieving political goals.
2.  The "drain of wealth" theory, primarily articulated by Dadabhai Naoroji, highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule and became a central theme of early nationalist discourse.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905) was characterized by a predominantly constitutional and non-violent approach to political reform.  The early nationalists, often termed "Moderates," believed in achieving their goals through petitions, constitutional agitation, and reasoned appeals to the British government.  The adoption of methods of mass civil disobedience and the more widespread use of violence came later in the nationalist movement. The early Congress leaders largely avoided direct confrontation with the British authorities, focusing instead on building a national consensus and advocating for reforms within the existing political framework.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's articulation of the "drain of wealth" theory was pivotal in shaping the economic critique of British rule in India during the early nationalist movement.  This theory highlighted the systematic transfer of India's resources to Britain through various economic policies and practices, demonstrating the economic exploitation inherent in colonial rule.  Naoroji's analysis provided a powerful argument for the need for economic reforms and self-governance, contributing significantly to the growing nationalist sentiment and shaping the economic demands of the movement.  The theory effectively exposed the economic inequalities and injustices embedded within the colonial system.


**5. With reference to the  Swarajist Party, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swarajist Party, formed after the Non-Cooperation Movement, advocated for complete boycott of all legislative councils.
2.  The party's strategy involved both participation in legislative councils and, if necessary, obstructionist tactics to challenge the government.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Swarajist Party, a faction within the Indian National Congress, emerged in response to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Unlike the "No-Changers," who advocated for a continued boycott of legislative councils, the Swarajists adopted a strategy of entering the councils to challenge the government from within. Their approach was not about complete boycott but rather a strategic utilization of the legislative arena for political action. This tactical decision reflected differing views within the Congress regarding the most effective approach to fighting for India's independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Swarajist Party's strategy was multifaceted.  It involved contesting elections and participating in legislative councils.  However, a crucial element of their approach was the use of obstructionist tactics within the councils. If the government refused to respond to their demands, the Swarajists planned to disrupt the functioning of the legislative bodies by employing methods such as moving adjournment motions and obstructing government business.  This strategy aimed to expose the limitations of the existing system and pressure the government into granting greater autonomy.  The Swarajists' approach represented a different strategy within the broader nationalist movement.


**6. With reference to the role of women in the Indian independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's approach to women's participation was primarily focused on their role as caregivers and homemakers.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose actively advocated for women's full participation in all aspects of national life, including military service.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Gandhi championed the cause of women and advocated for their upliftment, his vision of their role often reflected traditional patriarchal norms. He emphasized their importance as caregivers and homemakers while also encouraging their participation in the freedom struggle.  However, his views on women's roles were often viewed as conservative by later standards.  His emphasis on women's dharma, or duty, often focused on their domestic responsibilities, even as he promoted their involvement in non-violent resistance.  This complex perspective reflects the evolving understanding of gender roles within the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. Subhas Chandra Bose held a more progressive view of women's role in society and the independence movement. He actively advocated for their full and equal participation in all spheres of public life, including military service.  This is evidenced by his formation of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment in the Indian National Army (INA), a significant demonstration of his commitment to women's empowerment and their role in the fight for independence.  His approach contrasted sharply with some of the more traditional views prevalent at the time, highlighting the diversity of perspectives within the nationalist movement.  Bose's actions represent a significant departure from traditional gender roles.


**7. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement was launched immediately after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to express widespread outrage and initiate mass civil disobedience.
2.  Bhagat Singh was a key figure in the organization and execution of the Non-Cooperation Movement, leading several major actions of civil disobedience.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920, several years after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919). While the massacre undoubtedly fueled nationalist sentiment and contributed to the growing discontent against British rule, the Non-Cooperation Movement had a separate genesis and was intended as a broader campaign of non-violent resistance.  The timing of the movement reflected Gandhi's strategic assessment of the political situation and his belief in the efficacy of non-violent methods. The massacre, however, undoubtedly fuelled resentment against the British regime and contributed to the backdrop against which the movement unfolded.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bhagat Singh was a prominent revolutionary figure, he was not a key leader in the Non-Cooperation Movement. His revolutionary activities began later, after the movement's conclusion.  Bhagat Singh's ideology and methods differed significantly from Gandhi's non-violent approach.  While some revolutionary groups initially participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement, Bhagat Singh's direct involvement was not a defining feature of that period.  His contribution to the nationalist movement came through different means and at a later stage.


**8. With reference to the impact of World War II on the Indian independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The war initially strengthened the British position in India, leading to the suppression of nationalist activities and the postponement of constitutional reforms.
2.  The Cripps Mission, sent in 1942, offered India complete independence immediately, but the offer was rejected due to disagreements over the future status of princely states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The outbreak of World War II initially bolstered the British position in India.  The war effort required the mobilization of India's resources and manpower, and the British government used this situation to suppress nationalist activities and consolidate its control.  The war also led to a temporary diversion of attention from the demands for constitutional reforms, as the focus shifted to the war effort.  The British government prioritized maintaining control over India during the war and did not see the movement as an immediate threat. The war, however, ultimately created conditions that accelerated the movement towards independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did *not* offer India complete independence immediately. The offer was for dominion status after the war, with provisions for a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution.  While the offer did not grant immediate independence, which was a key demand of the Indian National Congress, the rejection was not solely due to the issue of princely states.  Disagreements over dominion status, the right of provinces to secede, and the lack of an immediate transfer of power were also significant factors leading to the Congress's rejection of the Cripps proposals. The mission's failure underscored the deep chasm between British intentions and Indian aspirations.


**9.  With reference to the differences between Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose's approaches to the independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Gandhi and Bose shared a deep belief in non-violence as the primary means of achieving independence.
2.  Bose advocated for a more militant approach, believing that India should utilize any available opportunity, including alliances with Axis powers, to achieve independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While both Gandhi and Bose were prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement, they held fundamentally different views on the means to achieve that goal.  Gandhi was a staunch advocate of non-violence (ahimsa) and satyagraha as the most effective and morally justifiable method of resistance.  Bose, while respecting Gandhi's contribution, disagreed with this strategy, believing that non-violent methods would be insufficient to secure independence.  Their contrasting approaches highlight the diversity of strategies employed within the broader nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. Bose advocated for a more militant and pragmatic approach to the struggle for independence. He believed that India should seize any opportunity presented by the international situation, even if that meant allying with powers like Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan (the Axis powers).  While he was not ideologically aligned with the Axis powers, his pragmatic approach prioritized achieving independence above all else.  His association with the Axis powers is often debated, but his willingness to pursue unconventional alliances reflects his belief in a more forceful and opportunistic approach to the struggle compared to Gandhi's non-violent strategy.  This difference in approach exemplifies the spectrum of viewpoints within the nationalist movement.


**10.  With reference to the  Indian National Congress's sessions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lucknow Session of 1916 was presided over by Annie Besant, marking a significant moment of unity between the Moderates and Extremists factions.
2.  The Surat Session of 1907 witnessed a major split within the Congress, dividing the organization into Moderate and Extremist factions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lucknow Session of 1916 was presided over by Ambika Charan Majumdar, not Annie Besant. While the session was significant for the Lucknow Pact, which temporarily united the Congress and the Muslim League, it did not primarily concern the reconciliation of the Moderate and Extremist factions within the Congress itself.  The reconciliation of the two factions was a later event and had separate occurrences.  The accurate identification of the presiding officer is crucial in understanding the historical context of this session.

Statement 2 is correct. The Surat Session of 1907 is famously known for the major split within the Indian National Congress. The division, driven by ideological differences and leadership disputes, resulted in the formation of two distinct factions: the Moderates and the Extremists.  This split significantly impacted the course of the nationalist movement, highlighting the internal struggles and the evolution of different approaches within the Congress.  The Surat split is a crucial event in the history of the Indian National Congress, illustrating the challenges faced by the organization in unifying its diverse membership.

**1. With reference to the impact of Aurangzeb's reign on the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's religious policies, while aiming to strengthen Islam's position, inadvertently weakened the Mughal Empire's administrative cohesion by alienating significant segments of the Hindu population.
2. Aurangzeb's prolonged Deccan campaigns, though initially successful in territorial expansion, ultimately drained the empire's resources and manpower, contributing to its decline.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Aurangzeb's reign and its consequences for the Mughal Empire.  Statement 1 highlights the significant tension created by Aurangzeb's religious policies. While he aimed to consolidate Islamic rule and enforce religious orthodoxy, his actions, such as the reimposition of the jizya tax and the destruction of temples, deeply alienated the substantial Hindu population. This alienation eroded the social and political base of the empire, weakening its administrative structure and fueling resentment, ultimately contributing to instability.  The emphasis on religious uniformity, rather than fostering inclusivity, undermined the multi-religious fabric that had, to a large extent, helped sustain the Mughal Empire under previous rulers.

Statement 2 correctly points to the debilitating effect of Aurangzeb's prolonged military campaigns in the Deccan. The Deccan wars, though initially yielding territorial gains, stretched the Mughal army's resources and manpower to their limits.  The prolonged conflicts depleted the imperial treasury, diverted resources from other crucial areas like infrastructure and administration, and led to a significant loss of life among both soldiers and civilians. This protracted warfare weakened the empire's central authority and created opportunities for regional revolts and the rise of competing powers, contributing significantly to the decline of Mughal power in the subsequent decades.  The constant drain on resources ultimately destabilized the empire, making it vulnerable to internal and external challenges.


**2. With reference to the administrative policies of the British in India after 1857, consider the following statements:**

1.  The British, after 1857, significantly increased investment in social services like education, healthcare, and infrastructure in an attempt to win over the Indian population and counter the rising tide of nationalism.
2. The British policy of "divide and rule" strategically exploited existing religious and caste divisions within Indian society, exacerbating tensions to maintain their control.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The British response to the 1857 revolt was not characterized by increased investment in Indian social services. On the contrary, the post-1857 period saw a shift towards more reactionary policies based on a perceived need to consolidate their control and suppress dissent.  While some limited improvements in infrastructure might have occurred for strategic purposes (like railways for military transport), there was no significant increase in social spending aimed at winning over the Indian population. The emphasis was on maintaining control, not on social upliftment. The British continued to prioritise military expenditure and the maintenance of their administrative apparatus.

Statement 2 is correct. The British actively pursued a policy of "divide and rule" to prevent a unified national movement against their rule. This strategy involved exploiting pre-existing social divisions along religious (Hindu-Muslim), regional, caste, and even linguistic lines.  The British often played different groups against each other, using patronage, concessions, and manipulation to prevent the formation of a cohesive and powerful opposition. This policy significantly contributed to the long-term instability and fragmentation of Indian society, facilitating British control.  The manipulation of religious differences, in particular, proved particularly effective in undermining the nascent nationalist movement.


**3. With reference to the impact of British revenue policies on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ryotwari system, while aiming for direct revenue collection, often led to over-assessment and exploitation of the peasantry due to inaccurate land surveys and inflexible tax rates.
2. The Permanent Settlement, by granting proprietary rights to Zamindars, resulted in increased agricultural productivity and improved the living standards of the peasantry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key problem with the Ryotwari system.  The British aimed to collect land revenue directly from individual cultivators (ryots), bypassing intermediaries. However, the implementation was flawed.  Inaccurate land surveys, coupled with inflexible tax rates that were often set too high regardless of actual yield or market prices, resulted in widespread over-assessment and exploitation of the peasantry.  Ryots were frequently forced into debt and impoverishment, struggling to meet the exorbitant demands. The system's inflexibility meant that during times of drought or famine, the tax burden remained unchanged, leading to further hardship.  This highlights a significant failure of the British revenue system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Permanent Settlement, while aiming to simplify revenue collection by dealing with a smaller number of Zamindars, did not lead to increased agricultural productivity or improved living standards for the peasantry. In fact, it had the opposite effect. Granting Zamindars proprietary rights incentivized rent extraction rather than agricultural investment.  The high fixed tax rates left little margin for Zamindars during crop failures and often led to the abandonment of land.  The system also fostered absentee landlordism and subinfeudation, further marginalizing the peasantry and driving them into debt.  The Permanent Settlement, therefore, contributed to the impoverishment of the rural population and exacerbated existing inequalities.


**4. With reference to the Indian National Congress's early years, consider the following statements:**

1. The Surat Split of 1907 formally divided the Congress into two distinct factions: Moderates and Extremists, marking a significant turning point in the nationalist movement.
2.  The Indian Councils Act of 1909, also known as the Morley-Minto Reforms, granted substantial self-governance to India, effectively addressing the Congress's demands for greater Indian participation in the administration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Surat Split of 1907 was a crucial event in the history of the Indian National Congress.  Deepening ideological differences between the Moderates and the Extremists, regarding the methods and goals of the nationalist movement, culminated in a formal split at the Surat session. This division significantly impacted the Congress's effectiveness and its ability to present a unified front against British rule. The split reflected the evolving nature of Indian nationalism, with the Extremists advocating for more assertive and radical methods of struggle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1909, while introducing some limited reforms like increased representation in legislative councils, did not grant substantial self-governance to India. The reforms were primarily intended to co-opt some Indian elites into the administrative system and to manage, rather than resolve, the growing nationalist sentiment. The Act fell far short of the Congress's demands for greater Indian participation in governance and did not address the fundamental issue of colonial control.  The reforms were largely inadequate and were seen by many nationalists as a token gesture.  The limited nature of the reforms further fueled the nationalist movement's growth.


**5. With reference to the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's first major Satyagraha campaign in India was the Ahmedabad Mill Strike of 1918, where he successfully negotiated a wage increase for textile workers through a fast unto death.
2.  Gandhi's philosophy emphasized a strict separation between religious faith and political action, advocating for a purely secular approach to the struggle for Indian independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Gandhi did successfully lead the Ahmedabad Mill Strike in 1918 using Satyagraha and a fast, his *first* major Satyagraha campaign in India was the Champaran Satyagraha of 1917, focusing on the plight of indigo farmers in Bihar. The Ahmedabad Mill Strike was a significant event, but it followed the Champaran campaign, which established Gandhi's approach to mass mobilization and non-violent resistance in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gandhi's philosophy did not advocate a strict separation between religious faith and political action.  His approach was deeply rooted in his Hindu faith, but it was a universalist, not a sectarian, vision.  His concepts of Satyagraha (truth force) and Ahimsa (non-violence) were integral to his political philosophy, and he often drew upon spiritual and ethical principles to guide his political strategies.  While he advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity and worked to address social issues like untouchability, his political activism was intrinsically linked to his religious beliefs and moral framework.  He sought to create a morally just society, and his religious convictions informed his political goals.

**1. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily advocated for complete independence from British rule, employing methods of mass civil disobedience from the outset.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule, significantly influencing nationalist discourse.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), often termed the "Moderate Phase," primarily focused on constitutional methods of agitation within the legal framework.  While the ultimate goal was self-government (Swaraj), the initial strategies involved petitions, resolutions, and appeals to the British government for reforms.  Mass civil disobedience and open defiance of British authority became more prominent in later phases of the movement, particularly after 1905.  The early nationalists believed in gradual, peaceful progress through constitutional means and lobbying within the existing system.  This approach differed significantly from the later, more radical and assertive strategies.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory was a cornerstone of early nationalist economic critique of British rule. This theory meticulously documented how British policies systematically extracted India's resources and wealth, leading to its impoverishment. This analysis provided a powerful economic argument for self-governance and fueled the nationalist movement by exposing the exploitative nature of colonial rule.  The theory highlighted the economic dimensions of imperialism, significantly influencing the nationalist movement's understanding of the colonial context and shaping its demands for economic reforms alongside political ones.  It provided a strong factual basis for the nationalist assertion that British rule was detrimental to India's economic well-being.


**2. With reference to Lord Curzon's tenure as Viceroy of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Curzon's administration primarily focused on decentralizing power and promoting local self-governance in India.
2.  The establishment of the Archaeological Survey of India is directly attributed to Lord Curzon's initiative and vision.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Lord Curzon's administration is largely remembered for its centralizing tendencies, rather than decentralization. He implemented policies that strengthened the central government's control over various aspects of Indian administration, including education and the police. His policies often aimed at increasing official control and streamlining administrative processes, reflecting a more centralized approach to governance.  This contrasted sharply with the later calls for greater autonomy and self-rule.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was indeed established during Lord Curzon's viceroyalty.  He was a strong proponent of preserving India's historical heritage and greatly supported the ASI's work in cataloging, preserving, and promoting ancient monuments and sites. His active interest and support for the ASI solidifies his association with the organization's establishment.  This reflects his broader interest in preserving and showcasing India's cultural past, even within the context of his overall imperialistic policies.



**3. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Non-Cooperation Movement was solely led by Mahatma Gandhi, with minimal participation from other prominent nationalist leaders.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident directly led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi was a pivotal figure and the driving force behind the Non-Cooperation Movement, it involved the participation of numerous other prominent nationalist leaders.  Figures like Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, and Subhas Chandra Bose, among others, played significant roles in mobilizing support and leading various aspects of the movement across different regions of India. The movement was a collaborative effort, though Gandhi's leadership was undeniable.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the death of several policemen, proved to be a turning point.  The violence deeply disturbed Gandhi, who believed in non-violent resistance.  This incident led him to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement, highlighting the inherent challenges of maintaining non-violent discipline within a large-scale mass movement. The suspension underscored the movement's reliance on non-violent methods and Gandhi's commitment to them, even at the cost of halting a significant phase of the struggle for independence.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909:**

1. The reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, ensuring their representation in legislative councils.
2.  The reforms significantly increased the number of elected Indian members in the Imperial Legislative Council, granting them substantial power over the budget.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key feature of the Morley-Minto Reforms was the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims. This meant that Muslim candidates were elected solely by Muslim voters, ensuring their representation in legislative bodies.  This policy, while intended to address Muslim concerns about their representation, had long-term consequences for communal politics in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Morley-Minto Reforms did increase the number of elected Indian members in the Imperial Legislative Council, the increase was not substantial enough to grant them significant power over the budget. The councils still lacked real power, and the officials retained a majority, limiting the influence of elected Indian representatives.  The reforms were more of a symbolic gesture towards greater Indian participation than a genuine transfer of power.  The budget remained largely under the control of the British government.


**5. With reference to the impact of the rediscovery of the Indian past on nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The rediscovery of ancient Indian texts and historical accounts fostered a sense of national pride and identity, independent of religious divisions.
2.  The emphasis on the glorious past of India invariably led to a complete rejection of Western ideas and influences by nationalist leaders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The rediscovery and reinterpretation of India's ancient history and culture played a crucial role in shaping Indian nationalism.  Scholars and nationalist leaders highlighted India's rich past, its achievements in various fields (philosophy, science, art, and governance), fostering a sense of national pride and collective identity.  This helped in uniting diverse groups under a shared national consciousness, although religious differences did continue to exist and sometimes intersect with nationalist sentiments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the rediscovery of the past instilled a sense of national pride and self-belief, it did not lead to a complete rejection of Western ideas and influences among nationalist leaders.  Many nationalists selectively adopted Western concepts like democracy, liberalism, and socialism, adapting them to the Indian context.   They recognized the value of Western thought and learning, even as they criticized colonial rule and sought to reclaim India's cultural heritage. The adoption of Western political ideals shows a nuanced approach to cultural exchange and the incorporation of international political discourse within the nationalist movement.

**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's initial success was largely due to the widespread participation of urban middle classes and the Congress's effective organization in major cities.
2.  The movement's eventual failure was primarily attributed to Gandhi's decision to suspend it following the Chauri Chaura incident, which involved violence against the police.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, witnessed significant initial success due to the enthusiastic participation of urban middle classes, students, and some sections of the peasantry.  The Congress's organizational strength in major cities played a crucial role in mobilizing support and coordinating activities.  The movement saw boycotts of British institutions, including schools, courts, and government services.  However, the movement's momentum was significantly hampered by the Chauri Chaura incident in 1922, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the deaths of several policemen.  This act of violence prompted Gandhi to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement, leading to its eventual decline.  While other factors contributed to the movement's eventual failure, the suspension following Chauri Chaura is widely considered the pivotal turning point.  Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the movement's trajectory.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of Western education on the Indian National Movement:**

1.  Western education created a class of Indians who, while initially loyal to the British, ultimately became critical of colonial rule and played a significant role in shaping the nationalist discourse.
2.  The introduction of Western scientific and rational thought, through education, directly led to the immediate rejection of Indian traditional knowledge systems and a complete embrace of Western ideologies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Western education in India, introduced during the British colonial period, had a multifaceted impact on the Indian National Movement. It created a class of educated Indians who initially held positions within the colonial administration or were employed in related fields. However, exposure to Western ideals of democracy, liberalism, and nationalism, coupled with witnessing the injustices of colonial rule firsthand, led many of these educated Indians to become critical of British policies.  This group played a crucial role in articulating nationalist sentiments, organizing political movements, and shaping the intellectual and ideological foundations of the struggle for independence.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the introduction of Western thought did not result in an immediate or complete rejection of Indian traditional knowledge systems.  Instead, a complex interaction occurred, with many nationalists drawing upon both Indian traditions and Western ideas to form their own unique perspectives and strategies for national liberation.  A nuanced and selective adoption of Western ideas, rather than wholesale replacement, characterized the nationalist response.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant legislative powers to elected provincial governments.
2.  The Act completely abolished the system of separate electorates for minority communities, paving the way for joint electorates in all provinces.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, is a landmark piece of legislation in the history of British India. A significant feature of this Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy, which granted substantial legislative powers to elected provincial governments. This marked a significant step towards self-governance in certain aspects of Indian administration.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act did aim to reduce the reliance on separate electorates, it did *not* completely abolish them. The Act retained separate electorates for certain communities, including Muslims and Sikhs, in some provinces.  This provision, intended to safeguard minority interests, proved to be a contentious issue and contributed to the political complexities of the period leading up to independence. The Act's provisions regarding provincial autonomy were a significant step towards self-rule but the continued use of separate electorates demonstrated the enduring complexities of communal politics in British India.


**4. With reference to the Rowlatt Act, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act was passed by the British Indian government despite widespread opposition from Indian political leaders and the general public.
2. The Act empowered the government to detain suspects without trial for up to two years, thus curtailing fundamental rights and civil liberties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, is a controversial piece of legislation in Indian history. It was enacted by the British Indian government despite widespread opposition from Indian political leaders and the general public.  This opposition stemmed from the Act's draconian provisions that curtailed fundamental rights and civil liberties.  The Act empowered the government to detain suspects without trial for up to two years, based on mere suspicion, without any need for legal due process.  This blatant disregard for basic human rights and the democratic principles fueled widespread protests and resentment against the British government. The passage of the Rowlatt Act, despite considerable opposition, highlighted the growing tension between the colonial government and the Indian nationalist movement and ultimately contributed to the escalation of unrest.  Both statements accurately describe the context and content of the Rowlatt Act.



**5. Consider the following statements about the activities of the Indian National Congress in its early years (1885-1905):**

1.  The Congress initially focused primarily on constitutional methods of agitation, such as petitions, resolutions, and public meetings, to press for reforms within the existing framework of British rule.
2.  From its inception, the Congress actively promoted mass mobilization and direct action against British rule, utilizing methods such as boycotts and civil disobedience.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

In its early years (1885-1905), the Indian National Congress largely adopted a moderate approach to political activism.  The Congress leaders primarily focused on constitutional methods of agitation within the legal framework of British rule.  These methods included submitting petitions to the British government, passing resolutions at their annual sessions, holding public meetings to raise awareness, and engaging in reasoned dialogue with British officials.  The focus was on persuading the British government to introduce reforms that would grant Indians a greater voice in their own governance.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Mass mobilization and direct action against British rule, such as widespread boycotts and civil disobedience, became more prominent features of the nationalist movement later, particularly after the rise of extremist leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak.  The early Congress prioritized constitutional methods, aiming to achieve gradual progress through engagement with the existing political system.


**6. With reference to the  "Doctrine of Lapse," consider the following statements:**

1.  The doctrine was primarily used by Lord Dalhousie to annex several Indian princely states during his tenure as Governor-General.
2. The doctrine stipulated that if a ruling prince died without a natural heir, the princely state would automatically revert to British control.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Doctrine of Lapse was a controversial policy implemented by the British East India Company, primarily during the governorship of Lord Dalhousie.  This policy was instrumental in the annexation of several Indian princely states. The core principle of the doctrine was that if a ruling prince died without a natural male heir (adopted heirs were specifically excluded), the princely state would automatically escheat (revert) to the British East India Company.  This policy was widely criticized by Indians as unjust and a violation of traditional succession practices, further fueling resentment against British rule.  The application of the Doctrine of Lapse led to the annexation of several states, significantly expanding British control over the Indian subcontinent.  Both statements accurately reflect the core tenets and consequences of this controversial policy.


**7. With reference to the  "Wood's Despatch," consider the following statements:**

1. The despatch advocated for the establishment of a comprehensive system of education in India, emphasizing the importance of vernacular languages alongside English.
2. The despatch completely rejected the idea of providing any form of religious education in government schools and colleges.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Wood's Despatch of 1854 was a significant document that shaped the development of the education system in British India.  It advocated for a comprehensive and systematic approach to education, recognizing the importance of both English and vernacular languages.  The despatch aimed to establish a hierarchical structure with primary schools at the base, followed by secondary and higher education institutions, all aiming for a balanced education system.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the despatch aimed to make education secular in nature, it did *not* completely reject religious education.  It proposed that religious instruction could be provided outside of regular school hours, acknowledging the religious sentiments prevalent in Indian society. The despatch sought to reform the education system but it did not impose a completely secular education structure.


**8.  With reference to the  "Ilbert Bill," consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bill aimed to remove the racial discrimination in the Indian judicial system by allowing Indian magistrates to try European offenders.
2. The Bill was passed without any significant opposition from the British community in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ilbert Bill, introduced in 1883, aimed to remove a significant instance of racial discrimination in the Indian judicial system.  The existing law allowed only European magistrates to try European offenders, regardless of the severity of the crime. The Ilbert Bill sought to amend this discriminatory provision, allowing Indian magistrates to try European offenders as well. This was a step towards ensuring equality before the law, irrespective of race or ethnicity.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Ilbert Bill faced strong opposition from the British community in India, who viewed it as an infringement on their privileges and status.  This opposition led to a significant public outcry and ultimately resulted in the bill being amended to retain some of the existing discriminatory provisions, reflecting the deep-seated racial biases within the colonial administration.


**9. With reference to  "Anand Math," consider the following statements:**

1. The novel is primarily known for its portrayal of the Sannyasi rebellion against the British East India Company in the 18th century.
2.  Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, the author, explicitly advocated for armed rebellion against British rule through this work.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's *Anand Math*, published in 1882, is a significant work of Bengali literature. The novel is best known for its portrayal of a Sannyasi rebellion against the oppressive rule of the East India Company during the 18th century.  The novel uses the rebellion as a backdrop to explore themes of nationalism, religious identity, and social justice.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While *Anand Math* is seen as a powerful expression of anti-British sentiment, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee did not explicitly advocate for armed rebellion against the British through this work.  The novel's depiction of the Sannyasi rebellion should be viewed as a historical narrative and symbolic representation of resistance, rather than a direct call to arms.  The novel's complex portrayal of resistance should be understood within its historical and literary context.


**10. With reference to the  "Quit India Movement," consider the following statements:**

1. The movement was launched in response to the failure of the Cripps Mission to offer a satisfactory solution to the issue of Indian independence.
2. The movement saw widespread participation from various sections of Indian society, including students, workers, and peasants, but notably lacked significant support from the princely states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Quit India Movement, launched in 1942, was a significant turning point in the Indian struggle for independence.  It was triggered by the failure of the Cripps Mission, which had failed to satisfy Indian demands for complete independence. The Cripps Mission's proposals fell short of expectations, leading to widespread disillusionment and intensifying the demand for an immediate end to British rule.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Quit India Movement witnessed unprecedented mass participation from various sections of Indian society, including students, workers, and peasants.  However, the movement's impact was significantly limited in the princely states, which generally remained largely aloof from the widespread civil disobedience and agitation.  The movement's widespread participation, despite the lack of significant princely state support, underscored the growing nationalist fervor within the Indian population.

**1. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's political career, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's initial political engagement involved advocating for the rights of Indian indentured laborers in South Africa, leading to the publication of "Indian Opinion."
2.  Following his return to India, Gandhi immediately launched a large-scale nationwide civil disobedience movement against the British Raj, culminating in the Salt Satyagraha.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Mahatma Gandhi's political activism began in South Africa where he championed the cause of Indian indentured laborers facing racial discrimination and oppression. This struggle significantly shaped his philosophy of Satyagraha and led to the publication of the influential newspaper "Indian Opinion," which served as a platform for disseminating his views and mobilizing support. His experiences in South Africa provided the foundation for his later political strategies in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gandhi's return to India marked a pivotal moment in the Indian independence movement, he did not immediately launch a large-scale nationwide civil disobedience campaign.  His initial focus was on localized struggles, such as the Champaran Satyagraha and the Kheda Satyagraha, gradually building momentum and expanding his influence before the larger-scale movements like the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Salt Satyagraha.  These initial campaigns were crucial in establishing his credibility and preparing the ground for mass mobilization. The Salt Satyagraha, a defining moment of the Indian independence movement, came later in his political career.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the gradual escalation of Gandhi's political activities in India.


**2. With reference to the early Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892, enacted in response to nationalist demands, granted Indians a majority in the legislative councils and significant control over the budget.
2.  The early Congress leaders, primarily moderates, advocated for complete independence from British rule from the outset.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the legislative councils and allow for some indirect Indian representation. However, it did *not* grant Indians a majority.  Officials retained a significant majority, limiting the actual power wielded by Indian members.  Furthermore, the Act did not grant substantial control over the budget; Indians could discuss the budget but could not vote on it, a key point of continued dissatisfaction for nationalists.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The early Congress leaders, characterized as "moderates," initially focused on gradual reforms within the existing British framework. Their primary goal was not immediate complete independence but rather increased Indian participation in governance and administrative reforms.  The demand for "Swaraj" (self-rule) evolved over time, with some later leaders advocating for complete independence while others continued to pursue a more gradual approach within the British Empire. The initial emphasis was on constitutional methods and appeals to British ideals of justice and fairness, rather than a direct confrontation aimed at immediate independence.


**3. With reference to Lord Curzon's tenure as Viceroy of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Curzon implemented significant administrative reforms, including the partition of Bengal, primarily to consolidate British power and suppress nationalist sentiments.
2.  Lord Curzon's policies were widely popular among the Indian populace, leading to a period of relative political calm and cooperation with the British government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Lord Curzon's administration saw several significant administrative changes, including the controversial partition of Bengal in 1905.  While Curzon presented these reforms as measures to improve efficiency and governance, a key underlying motive was to weaken the growing nationalist movement by dividing and weakening its organizational capacity. The partition, in particular, provoked widespread protests and strengthened nationalist sentiment, directly contradicting Curzon's intended outcome.  His other administrative actions, such as increased official control and the establishment of institutions like the Pusa agricultural research institute, also reflected a strategy to consolidate British control and influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Lord Curzon's policies, particularly the partition of Bengal, were extremely unpopular among a large segment of the Indian population. They generated significant opposition and fueled nationalist sentiment, leading to widespread protests and boycotts.  The period of his viceroyalty was far from politically calm; it witnessed a surge in nationalist activity and resistance against British rule, directly contradicting the statement's assertion of cooperation and political calm.


**4. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob of protestors attacked a police station, led to the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi.
2. The Khilafat Movement, focused on the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate, played a negligible role in mobilizing Muslim support for the Non-Cooperation Movement.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, a tragic event where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the deaths of several policemen, proved to be a turning point in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Mahatma Gandhi, deeply committed to non-violent methods, viewed this incident as a serious breach of the movement's principles and consequently suspended the movement to re-emphasize the importance of non-violence and to prevent further escalation of violence. The suspension, while controversial among some nationalist leaders who felt the movement should continue, highlighted Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violent resistance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Khilafat Movement, focused on the protection of the Ottoman Caliphate, played a significant role in mobilizing Muslim support for the Non-Cooperation Movement. The shared concern over the fate of the Caliphate created a crucial bond between Hindu and Muslim nationalists, fostering a sense of unity and expanding the movement's reach and influence across religious communities. The combined efforts of the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat movements represented a powerful demonstration of pan-Indian nationalist sentiment.


**5. With reference to the Home Rule Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak independently launched Home Rule Leagues, advocating for self-government within the British Empire.
2.  The Home Rule Movement primarily focused on armed rebellion and violent overthrow of British rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Home Rule Movement, a significant phase in the Indian independence struggle, saw the establishment of two separate Home Rule Leagues. Annie Besant, a prominent Theosophist and political activist, launched one league, while Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a leading nationalist figure, established another.  Both leagues, while operating independently, shared the common goal of achieving self-governance for India within the framework of the British Empire.  This movement played a crucial role in raising political consciousness among the Indian population and preparing the ground for future mass movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Home Rule Movement was characterized by its emphasis on constitutional methods and non-violent resistance.  While there was a growing sentiment for complete independence, the movement's primary strategy was not armed rebellion or violent overthrow of British rule.  The leagues focused on political education, public awareness campaigns, and advocacy for self-rule through constitutional means, reflecting the prevailing moderate approach within the nationalist movement at that time.  The movement's focus on non-violent methods distinguished it from later, more militant phases of the freedom struggle.


**6. With reference to Lord William Bentinck's governorship, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord William Bentinck annexed Mysore state following allegations of mismanagement and maladministration.
2.  Lord William Bentinck's administration saw the abolition of Sati and the suppression of Thuggee, reflecting a commitment to social reform.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Lord William Bentinck's tenure as Governor-General of India included the temporary assumption of control over Mysore following allegations of misrule and maladministration within the princely state.  While not a formal annexation in the sense of permanent territorial acquisition, the British intervention highlighted the extent to which the British government could intervene in the affairs of princely states when deemed necessary.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Lord William Bentinck's administration was marked by significant social reforms. He played a crucial role in the abolition of Sati (the practice of widow immolation) and the suppression of Thuggee (a criminal cult), demonstrating a commitment to social justice and the modernization of Indian society.  These actions, while controversial in certain quarters, reflected a progressive approach to governance and a concern for the welfare of the Indian population.  These reforms are considered landmark achievements of his administration and showcase a distinct aspect of his governance.


**7. With reference to the activities of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tilak's newspapers, *Kesari* and *Mahratta*, played a key role in propagating nationalist ideas and mobilizing public opinion against British rule.
2.  Tilak's advocacy for Swaraj primarily focused on gradual constitutional reforms within the existing British system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a highly influential figure in the Indian independence movement. His newspapers, *Kesari* (Marathi) and *Mahratta* (English), served as powerful platforms for disseminating nationalist ideas, mobilizing public opinion, and criticizing British policies.  These publications played a crucial role in shaping the political discourse and fostering a sense of national unity and resistance against colonial rule. His writings and editorials were known for their strong nationalist sentiment and their critique of British imperialism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Tilak did participate in constitutional politics at times, his advocacy for Swaraj was characterized by a more assertive and militant approach. He championed the cause of *Swaraj* (self-rule) through methods that went beyond mere constitutional reform, including the promotion of *Swadeshi* (boycott of British goods) and the organization of festivals like the Ganesh and Shivaji festivals to promote national pride and unity.  His stance often placed him at odds with the more moderate faction within the Indian National Congress, highlighting his distinct political ideology and methods.  He was a significant figure in the Extremist faction of the Congress.


**8. With reference to the views of Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi and Bose strongly disagreed on the means of achieving independence, with Gandhi advocating for non-violent resistance and Bose supporting the use of armed struggle when necessary.
2.  Gandhi and Bose shared a common vision of a post-independent India that would be based on socialist principles and a rejection of capitalism and communism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, while both deeply committed to India's independence, held fundamentally different views on the strategy to achieve this goal. Gandhi was a staunch advocate of *ahimsa* (non-violence) and *satyagraha* (non-violent resistance) as the primary means to achieve independence.  Bose, while respecting Gandhi's approach, believed that armed struggle could be a necessary component of the fight for freedom, particularly given the circumstances of World War II. This fundamental difference in approach led to significant tensions and disagreements between them.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Despite their differences in approach to the struggle for independence, Gandhi and Bose shared considerable common ground in their vision for post-independent India. Both believed that a socialist framework would be necessary for addressing India's social and economic inequalities.  They both rejected unadulterated capitalism for its exploitative tendencies and communism for its authoritarianism and disregard for individual liberties.  Their shared socialist leanings, though with differing interpretations, reflect a common concern for the welfare of the Indian masses and the creation of a just and equitable society.  However, their interpretations of socialism differed considerably.


**9.  With reference to the early years of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first session of the Indian National Congress was attended by a large number of delegates representing diverse sections of Indian society, demonstrating immediate widespread support for the organization.
2.  A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a crucial role in the founding of the Indian National Congress, though the extent of his influence and motives remain debated among historians.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first session of the Indian National Congress, held in 1885, was attended by a relatively small number of delegates, primarily from the educated elite. While it marked a significant step in the formation of a national platform, it did not demonstrate immediate widespread support across diverse sections of Indian society.  The movement's reach and influence expanded gradually over time as it gained traction and mobilized broader support.

Statement 2 is correct. A.O. Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a pivotal role in the founding of the Indian National Congress. He initiated the process of bringing together leading intellectuals and political figures to form the organization. However, the nature and extent of his influence, and his underlying motives, remain a subject of historical debate.  Some historians suggest that he aimed to create a "safety valve" to channel Indian discontent, while others argue that he acted as a catalyst for the emergence of a unified nationalist movement.  The debate centers around whether Hume's actions were primarily motivated by a genuine desire to assist Indian aspirations or by a strategic attempt to manage nationalist sentiment and prevent more radical uprisings.

**1. With reference to the early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress initially focused on constitutional methods, advocating for reforms within the existing British framework, rather than outright independence.
2.  The Congress's early leadership predominantly consisted of lawyers, journalists, and landowners, reflecting the socio-economic composition of the educated elite.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The early phase of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905) is characterized by a predominantly constitutional approach to political reform.  The leaders, often termed "Moderates," believed in working within the existing system to gradually achieve greater Indian participation in governance.  They employed methods like petitions, resolutions, and public appeals to the British government, aiming for incremental reforms rather than immediate independence.  This strategy reflected a belief that the British system was capable of reform and that a gradual approach would be more effective than confrontation.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this constitutionalist approach.

Statement 2 is also correct. The initial membership of the Congress largely comprised members from the educated elite, including lawyers, journalists, and landowners.  This was due to the limited access to education and the socio-economic structure of the time.  These individuals possessed the resources, education, and networks necessary to participate in organized political action.  While the Congress aimed to represent the broader Indian population, its early leadership and membership were heavily skewed towards this segment of society.  The absence of significant representation from the peasantry or working classes during this period is a crucial aspect of understanding the limitations of the early Congress movement.


**2. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's success was largely due to the immediate and widespread participation of the peasantry and industrial workers, who formed the backbone of the protests.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, marked by violence against police, prompted Gandhi to suspend the movement, highlighting the challenges of maintaining non-violent discipline.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Non-Cooperation Movement witnessed participation from various segments of society, including peasants and students, Statement 1 overstates the immediate and dominant role of peasantry and industrial workers.  The initial stages of the movement were largely driven by the urban middle class and educated elite.  Although peasant participation increased significantly later, it wasn't the immediate and defining factor of the movement's initial success. The movement's impact on peasants was largely indirect, manifesting through local uprisings and agitations, rather than a unified, centrally organized peasant movement within the initial framework of the Non-Cooperation Movement. The movement's impact on the industrial working class was similarly limited in the early stages.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.

Statement 2 is accurate. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob of protestors set fire to a police station, resulting in the death of policemen, was a turning point in the Non-Cooperation Movement.  This act of violence directly contradicted Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance.  Gandhi, deeply committed to non-violence, saw this incident as a serious breach of the movement's principles and a threat to its overall success.  The incident underscored the difficulty of maintaining non-violent discipline among a large and diverse group of participants, particularly in the face of police repression and escalating tensions.  Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement demonstrated his commitment to non-violent principles even at the cost of immediate political gains.


**3.  With reference to the Cripps Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The mission offered complete independence to India immediately, aiming to secure India's full support in the Second World War.
2.  The proposal for the formation of a Constituent Assembly was a significant departure from previous British policies, granting Indians greater autonomy in shaping their future.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did *not* offer complete independence to India immediately. Instead, it proposed dominion status after the war, with the option for future independence through a Constituent Assembly.  The offer was conditional, linked to India's participation in the war effort, and contained significant safeguards for British interests, particularly concerning defense and minority rights.  The immediate granting of complete independence was never on the table, making statement 1 a significant misrepresentation of the Cripps Mission's proposals.  This failure to address the fundamental demand for immediate independence was a major reason why the mission ultimately failed to achieve its objectives.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The proposal for a Constituent Assembly to frame India's future constitution was indeed a significant shift from earlier British policies.  Previous offers had involved limited Indian participation in constitutional development, but the Cripps Mission proposed a body primarily composed of Indian representatives to draft a new constitution.  Although there were complexities and limitations to the proposed assembly's composition (e.g., representation of princely states), the principle of granting Indians primary responsibility for constitution-making was a significant concession and represented a move towards self-determination.  Therefore, statement 2 accurately captures this important aspect of the Cripps Mission proposals.  The ambiguity around the powers of the Constituent Assembly and the conditions attached to the transfer of power, however, were crucial factors in the mission's failure.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Mahatma Gandhi's political philosophy:**

1. Gandhi's concept of Ramrajya emphasized a centralized, authoritarian state with strong government control over the economy and social structures.
2. Gandhi's advocacy of Swadeshi promoted the revival of indigenous industries and self-reliance, challenging British economic dominance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gandhi's vision of Ramrajya was not about a centralized, authoritarian state.  Instead, it represented an idealized society based on decentralized governance, self-rule at the village level (Gram Swaraj), and moral principles like truth and non-violence.  This vision emphasized individual and community self-governance, rejecting the concentration of power in a centralized state.  The concept of Ramrajya was more of a utopian ideal, focusing on social harmony, self-sufficiency, and ethical conduct, rather than a specific political structure with defined powers. The statement incorrectly attributes characteristics of a centralized state to Gandhi's concept, which is fundamentally at odds with his philosophy of decentralized governance.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gandhi's advocacy of Swadeshi was a core element of his economic and political philosophy.  Swadeshi promoted self-reliance and the revival of indigenous industries as a means of challenging British economic control over India. It aimed to empower Indian artisans and producers, reduce dependence on foreign goods, and strengthen the Indian economy.  This economic strategy was directly connected to his political struggle for independence, emphasizing the need for economic self-sufficiency as a foundation for political freedom.  The boycott of British goods and promotion of Indian-made products were key aspects of the Swadeshi movement, reflecting Gandhi's commitment to economic nationalism.


**5. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule, emphasizing the transfer of resources to Britain.
2.  The Ilbert Bill controversy demonstrated the early nationalists' commitment to social reform by advocating for equal legal rights for Indians and Europeans.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory was a significant contribution to the early nationalist movement's understanding of British rule.  This theory systematically exposed the economic exploitation of India, arguing that British policies led to a systematic transfer of India's wealth to Britain.  Naoroji's analysis provided a powerful economic critique of colonialism, demonstrating how British rule served the economic interests of Britain at the expense of India.  This economic argument became a crucial component of the nationalist movement's critique of British rule, mobilizing support by highlighting the tangible negative consequences of British policies on the Indian economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ilbert Bill controversy primarily revolved around the issue of jurisdiction in criminal cases.  The bill proposed to allow Indian magistrates to try European civilians, which was met with strong resistance from the European community in India. The controversy mainly centered on racial discrimination within the legal system, rather than a broader effort for social reform.  While early nationalists opposed the bill's defeat, the central issue was about judicial equality rather than a broader social reform agenda.  The controversy, therefore, did not directly demonstrate a commitment to social reform in the sense of addressing broader issues of social inequality and caste discrimination, but rather focused on equal treatment within the judicial system.

**1. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's socio-political philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's initial foray into Satyagraha in India involved a direct challenge to the oppressive practices of European indigo planters in Champaran, Bihar, focusing on issues of unfair pricing and forced cultivation.  This involved detailed investigation and a defiance of official orders, leading to a partial victory and highlighting the pervasive poverty among Indian peasantry.
2.  Gandhi's advocacy for Hindu-Muslim unity, eradication of untouchability, and the elevation of women's social status were not merely abstract ideals, but integral components of his vision for a truly independent and equitable India, demonstrated through his actions and writings.  His approach often involved direct engagement with the affected communities and the adoption of methods like fasting for social reform.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy and actions. Statement 1 correctly describes the Champaran Satyagraha (1917) as Gandhi's first major Satyagraha movement in India, highlighting its focus on the plight of indigo farmers, his methodology of investigation and civil disobedience, and the resulting impact on his understanding of Indian poverty. This event is crucial in understanding his evolving strategy of mass mobilization.  The statement doesn't misrepresent the facts or timelines.


Statement 2 correctly identifies three core pillars of Gandhi's socio-political vision: Hindu-Muslim unity (crucial for a unified India), the fight against untouchability (a deeply rooted social injustice), and women's emancipation (essential for social progress).  The statement accurately conveys that these were not merely rhetorical pronouncements, but actively pursued goals throughout his life, often employing innovative methods such as fasting to achieve social change.  The emphasis on his practical application of his beliefs is accurate and relevant to understanding his leadership style.


The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.  The statements are factually correct and represent significant elements of Gandhi's work and philosophy.  A comprehensive understanding of Gandhi requires acknowledging both his strategic use of Satyagraha and his commitment to broader social reforms.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Partition of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Partition's immediate aftermath witnessed widespread communal violence and displacement, primarily affecting the populations of Bengal and Punjab, while other regions experienced relatively less disruption. The scale of the violence and displacement significantly impacted the social fabric of these areas.
2.  Rajendra Prasad, in his assessment, attributed the creation of Pakistan primarily to the influence of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, while downplaying the role of other actors or factors involved in the complex process of partition.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely accurate. While the Partition's impact was felt across India, the provinces of Bengal and Punjab bore the brunt of the immediate and most intense communal violence and mass displacement. The scale of the human tragedy in these regions far exceeded that in other parts of the country. This violence and displacement are well-documented historical events, with significant long-term consequences for the social and political landscape of these areas. The statement's focus on the disproportionate impact on Bengal and Punjab is accurate.


Statement 2 is an oversimplification and potentially inaccurate. While Muhammad Ali Jinnah was undoubtedly a central figure in the creation of Pakistan, attributing the Partition solely to his influence ignores the complex interplay of political, social, and economic factors that contributed to the decision.  The British government's role, the actions of other political leaders, and the existing communal tensions within India all played significant parts.  Rajendra Prasad's view, as presented, is a limited perspective and does not offer a complete explanation of the Partition's complex causes. The statement presents a simplistic and potentially biased interpretation of a multifaceted historical event.


Therefore, only Statement 1 provides a largely accurate depiction of a significant consequence of the Partition.  Option (a) is the correct answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy or oversimplification presented in Statement 2.


**3. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalist movement, characterized by "moderate" leaders, primarily employed constitutional methods of agitation, focusing on petitions, public meetings, and reasoned appeals to the British government for reforms, while largely avoiding direct confrontation or mass mobilization.  This approach reflected a belief in gradual progress within the existing political framework.
2.  The "Moderates" consistently professed unwavering loyalty to British rule, viewing continued political connection with Britain as essential for India's progress, even while advocating for internal reforms and greater Indian participation in governance.  This stance, while seemingly contradictory, reflects the complexities of their political position.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately characterize the strategies and perspectives of the "Moderate" faction within the early Indian nationalist movement. Statement 1 correctly describes their primary methods of political engagement as constitutional, focusing on appeals and petitions within the existing legal and political structures.  Their emphasis on reasoned arguments and gradual reforms is a well-established feature of their approach.  The statement avoids exaggeration or misrepresentation of their tactics.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the nuanced position of many Moderate leaders. Their professions of loyalty to the British crown, while seemingly at odds with their demands for reform, stemmed from a belief that gradual, constitutional change was the most effective path to improving India's governance and status within the British Empire.  This complex position is important to understanding their political strategy and the internal debates within the nationalist movement.  The statement recognizes the complexities of their position without simplifying it.


The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.  A complete understanding of the early nationalist movement necessitates an understanding of both their methods of political action and their sometimes-contradictory stance on the nature of the relationship with Britain.  The statements present a balanced and accurate portrayal of the "Moderates."


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Rowlatt Act and Gandhi's response:**

1.  The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, granted the British government extraordinary powers to suppress dissent, including the right to detain individuals without trial for extended periods, and this legislation was passed despite widespread opposition from Indian nationalists.
2. Gandhi's response to the Rowlatt Act involved launching the Rowlatt Satyagraha, marking a significant shift towards mass civil disobedience as a method of political resistance, which involved widespread hartals, strikes, and demonstrations across India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the historical context of the Rowlatt Act and Gandhi's response. Statement 1 correctly describes the Rowlatt Act's draconian provisions, which allowed for arbitrary arrests and detentions without trial.  This was a highly controversial piece of legislation, passed despite strong opposition from Indian nationalists who viewed it as a direct attack on fundamental civil liberties. The statement accurately highlights the repressive nature of the Act and the context of its passing.

Statement 2 accurately portrays Gandhi's response as the launch of the Rowlatt Satyagraha, a pivotal moment in the Indian independence movement.  This marked a significant shift towards mass civil disobedience as a primary method of political resistance.  The widespread hartals, strikes, and demonstrations that followed demonstrated a new level of mass participation in the struggle against British rule. The statement correctly identifies the nature of Gandhi's response and its significance.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.  A comprehensive understanding of this period requires knowledge of both the repressive nature of the Rowlatt Act and the significance of Gandhi's shift towards mass civil disobedience as a form of resistance.  Both statements are historically accurate and essential to understanding the escalation of the Indian independence movement.


**5. With reference to the activities of the Anushilan Samiti, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anushilan Samiti, primarily active in Bengal, was a revolutionary organization that advocated for complete independence from British rule and employed methods of revolutionary terrorism, including assassinations and bombings, as a means to achieve their goal.  Their activities reflected a growing frustration with constitutional methods of resistance.
2.  The Anushilan Samiti's activities were entirely confined to within India and they did not establish any connections or networks with revolutionary groups or individuals based abroad, maintaining a strictly domestic focus on their operations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Anushilan Samiti's ideology and methods.  The organization, primarily based in Bengal, was a key player in the revolutionary movement. They advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) and utilized methods of revolutionary terrorism, including assassinations and bombings, reflecting a belief that armed struggle was necessary to overthrow British rule.  Their actions represent a significant departure from the constitutional methods of earlier nationalist groups.  The statement is factually accurate and well-supported by historical evidence.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Anushilan Samiti's main operations were based in India, they did establish connections and networks with revolutionary groups and individuals abroad.  This international dimension allowed for the exchange of ideas, resources, and support for their activities.  The statement's assertion of a purely domestic focus is inaccurate.


Therefore, only Statement 1 is correct. Option (a) is the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of Statement 2, which overlooks the international connections of the Anushilan Samiti.  The question tests the understanding of the organization's actions and their broader context within the revolutionary movement.

**1. With reference to the British revenue policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal and Bihar, granted proprietary rights to the Zamindars, significantly impacting land ownership and revenue collection.
2. The Ryotwari System, prevalent in parts of Madras and Bombay Presidencies, directly assessed land revenue from individual cultivators, bypassing intermediaries like Zamindars.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of British revenue policies in India.  Statement 1 correctly describes the Permanent Settlement, a landmark policy introduced by Lord Cornwallis.  This system aimed to simplify revenue collection by granting proprietary rights to Zamindars, who then became responsible for collecting revenue from the cultivators (ryots).  While intended to foster agricultural improvement, the high revenue demands often led to Zamindar indebtedness and exploitation of ryots. This system profoundly altered land ownership patterns and the relationship between the state and the agrarian population, leaving a lasting impact on India's social and economic landscape.

Statement 2 accurately portrays the Ryotwari System, developed by officials like Thomas Munro in the Madras Presidency. This system, unlike the Permanent Settlement, eliminated intermediaries and collected revenue directly from individual cultivators. While theoretically offering greater equity, the system's reliance on accurate land surveys and assessments was often problematic, leading to overestimation of land productivity and subsequent peasant impoverishment.  The inflexible tax demands, regardless of crop yields or market prices, frequently pushed ryots into debt and hardship.  Both systems, while differing in their approach, contributed to the transformation of India's agrarian structure and had significant long-term consequences.


**2. With reference to the British social and cultural policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British initially adopted a policy of non-interference in Indian social and religious matters, but later actively promoted Westernization and Christian missionary activities to transform Indian society.
2.  While the British government encouraged modern education in India, particularly after the 1833 Charter Act,  it simultaneously adopted measures to suppress nationalist sentiments expressed through the Indian press.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the complexities of British social and cultural policies in India. Statement 1 highlights the shift in British policy from a period of relative non-interference in the early years of colonial rule to a more active role in shaping Indian society. This change was driven by factors such as the rise of industrial capitalism in Britain, the spread of new ideologies like utilitarianism and humanism, and the ambitions of Christian missionaries. The missionaries, often supported by sections of the British administration, actively sought to convert Indians to Christianity and promote Western values, leading to cultural clashes and resistance. This shift in policy demonstrates the evolving relationship between the colonial power and the Indian population.

Statement 2 underscores the contradictory nature of British policies concerning education. While the British government did promote modern education, particularly after the 1833 Charter Act, this was often accompanied by measures designed to control and suppress the expression of Indian nationalism. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, for instance, was a direct attempt to curb the influence of the Indian-language press, which was increasingly being used to voice nationalist sentiments and critique British rule. This reveals the inherent tension between the British desire to modernize India for their own economic and political benefit and their simultaneous efforts to maintain control and suppress dissent.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the growth of communalism in India during British rule:**

1. The British policy of separate electorates, introduced through various acts, exacerbated communal tensions by fostering separate political identities for different religious communities.
2.  The Indian National Congress, despite its efforts to promote national unity, failed to secure significant representation among minority communities in the legislative assemblies, contributing to the rise of communal politics.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly identify crucial factors contributing to the rise of communalism in India during British rule. Statement 1 accurately points to the role of separate electorates as a key catalyst for communal division.  Introduced through acts like the Government of India Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms) and further solidified in subsequent acts, these electorates created separate voting rolls for different religious communities, particularly Hindus and Muslims.  This institutionalized separation fostered the development of distinct political identities and interests, making it harder to achieve national unity and increasing the potential for inter-communal conflict. The system reinforced the idea of separate political representation based on religious affiliation, rather than shared national identity.

Statement 2 correctly observes the Congress's limited success in gaining support among minority communities. Despite the Congress's overall goal of national unity and inclusive representation,  its struggles to win over significant numbers of minority seats in the legislative assemblies created a political vacuum that communal organizations, such as the Muslim League, were able to exploit.  The Congress's failure to effectively address the concerns and aspirations of minority communities, particularly Muslims, contributed to the growth of separatist sentiments and ultimately played a part in the partition of India.  The limited success of the Congress in winning seats reserved for minorities, especially Muslims, highlighted its challenges in bridging the communal divide.


**4. With reference to the Cripps Mission and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission's proposal for a dominion status for India, while offering a degree of self-governance, failed to satisfy the Congress's demand for complete independence, leading to its rejection.
2. The failure of the Cripps Mission, coupled with the escalating threat of a Japanese invasion, strengthened the resolve of the Indian National Congress to launch a mass movement for independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the significance of the Cripps Mission and its consequences for the Indian independence movement. Statement 1 correctly identifies the central point of contention between the British government and the Congress. The Cripps Mission, while offering dominion status within the Commonwealth, fell short of the Congress's demand for complete and immediate independence. This fundamental difference in perspective on the future status of India led to the rejection of the Cripps proposals by the Congress. The offer of dominion status, falling short of complete independence, was a key factor in the Congress's rejection of the Cripps proposals.

Statement 2 accurately captures the impact of the mission's failure on the Indian nationalist movement. The Cripps Mission's failure, combined with the growing threat of a Japanese invasion of India, significantly altered the political landscape.  The sense of betrayal and frustration among Indian nationalists, coupled with the perceived urgency of the situation, strengthened the resolve within the Congress to launch a more decisive and comprehensive movement for independence.  This ultimately culminated in the Quit India Movement of 1942. The imminent threat of Japanese invasion added to the pressure for immediate action.


**5. With reference to the Indian National Congress's internal dynamics during the period leading up to Indian independence, consider the following statements:**

1.  Subhas Chandra Bose's election as Congress President in 1939 reflected a growing divergence within the Congress regarding the strategy and methods for achieving independence, particularly concerning the role of non-violent resistance.
2. The ideological differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, specifically regarding the methods of struggle for independence, led to a major crisis within the Congress, culminating in Bose's resignation as President.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately depict significant aspects of the Indian National Congress's internal struggles during the crucial period leading up to independence. Statement 1 correctly highlights the significance of Subhas Chandra Bose's election as Congress President in 1939.  Bose's victory, against the backdrop of Gandhi's preference for another candidate, signaled a growing rift within the Congress over the most effective approach to achieving independence.  While Gandhi championed non-violent resistance (Satyagraha), Bose advocated for a more assertive and potentially violent approach, believing that India needed to seize opportunities presented by the global context of World War II.  Bose's election exposed the existing tensions between different factions within the Congress.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the outcome of these ideological differences. The contrasting approaches of Gandhi and Bose regarding the means to achieve independence created a serious internal crisis within the Congress.  The conflict, culminating in the Tripuri Congress session, resulted in Bose's resignation from the presidency. This event marked a significant turning point, highlighting the deep-seated ideological divisions within the Congress leadership and its impact on the overall direction of the freedom struggle. The resignation dramatically impacted the course of the independence movement.


**6. With reference to the British administrative policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The British policy of "divide and rule" involved exploiting existing social and religious divisions to prevent the emergence of a unified national movement challenging their authority.
2.  The British government actively promoted the interests of Zamindars and landlords, often at the expense of the peasantry, to secure their support and counter the growing influence of nationalist leaders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key elements of British administrative policies in India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the "divide and rule" strategy as a cornerstone of British colonial administration.  This policy involved strategically exploiting existing social, religious, caste, regional, and linguistic differences within Indian society to weaken potential resistance to British rule. By playing different groups against each other, the British sought to prevent the formation of a cohesive and powerful national movement that could challenge their authority. This strategy was employed consistently throughout the colonial period.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the British government's preferential treatment of Zamindars and landlords.  The British often allied with these powerful landowning classes to counter the growing influence of nationalist leaders among the peasantry.  By protecting the interests and privileges of Zamindars, often at the expense of the rights and welfare of the peasantry, the British secured their support and created a system of social and economic inequality which further destabilized the Indian social structure. This policy contributed to widespread rural poverty and resentment against British rule.  The British systematically used this strategy to maintain their power.

**1. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's early political activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's first significant application of Satyagraha was during his campaign against racial discrimination in South Africa, preceding its application in Champaran, India.
2.  The Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association, a prominent organization advocating for workers' rights, was directly founded by Mahatma Gandhi during his early years in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Gandhi's Satyagraha philosophy and its practical application were initially honed during his long struggle against racial injustice in South Africa.  The Champaran Satyagraha, while a landmark event in the Indian context, followed his South African experiences.  His time in South Africa provided the crucial crucible for developing and refining Satyagraha as a potent tool for non-violent resistance.  The success he achieved in South Africa emboldened him to employ the same strategy in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gandhi was deeply involved in labor movements and championed the rights of workers, the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association (ATLA) wasn't directly founded by him.  He played a crucial role in its development and growth, offering significant support and guidance, but its origins involved other key figures as well.  This statement presents a misconception about the degree of Gandhi's direct involvement in the founding of the ATLA, overemphasizing his role.  UPSC questions often test the nuances of historical events, requiring precise understanding of causation and agency.


**2. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's ideology and political stances, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's advocacy for Swaraj encompassed a vision of self-rule that prioritized economic independence and village-based self-sufficiency, as opposed to solely political independence from British rule.
2.  Gandhi's unwavering commitment to Ahimsa (non-violence) led him to completely reject any form of violent resistance, even during the most critical junctures of the Indian independence movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gandhi's concept of Swaraj extended beyond mere political freedom.  He envisioned a self-reliant India, particularly emphasizing economic self-sufficiency at the village level.  His promotion of Khadi (hand-spun cloth) and his emphasis on village industries were integral to this vision.  He saw political independence as intertwined with economic empowerment and social reform.  This holistic understanding of Swaraj is crucial for understanding his overall political philosophy and differentiates his ideology from purely political movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gandhi was an ardent advocate of Ahimsa and consistently emphasized non-violent methods, it's an oversimplification to say he completely rejected all forms of violent resistance.  The complexities of the Indian freedom struggle sometimes led to situations where violence erupted, despite his best efforts.  Furthermore, his approach involved a strategic and nuanced understanding of non-violent resistance, recognizing that the consequences of actions could sometimes lead to unintended violence.  This statement incorrectly portrays a rigid and inflexible position on violence, overlooking the complexities of Gandhi's approach and the realities of the independence movement.


**3. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's interactions with other leaders, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahatma Gandhi's relationship with Jawaharlal Nehru was characterized by consistent agreement on political strategies and approaches, owing to their shared socialist leanings.
2.  Gandhi actively supported the nomination of Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Prime Minister of India, reflecting his complete faith in Nehru's leadership capabilities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhi and Nehru collaborated closely in the independence movement, their political views and strategies weren't always aligned.  While Gandhi championed a decentralized, village-based economy, Nehru leaned towards a more centralized, industrialized model.  Their disagreements on economic policy and other crucial matters are well-documented.  This statement incorrectly presents a harmonious and unified approach, overlooking the significant differences in their political and economic philosophies.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gandhi did indeed support Nehru's nomination as the first Prime Minister of India.  Although he had reservations about certain aspects of Nehru's approach, he recognized Nehru's position and influence within the Congress and believed him to be a suitable leader for the newly independent nation.  His endorsement, despite any potential disagreements, solidified Nehru's claim to the leadership role.  This fact demonstrates Gandhi's pragmatic approach to leadership selection, even when personal preferences may have differed.


**4. With reference to the Champaran Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Champaran Satyagraha, led by Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, primarily focused on addressing the grievances of indigo farmers concerning unfair land revenue policies imposed by the British government.
2.  The success of the Champaran Satyagraha directly resulted in the immediate abolition of the exploitative indigo plantation system throughout British India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha primarily focused on the plight of the indigo farmers who were forced to cultivate indigo on a portion of their land under exploitative contracts imposed by British planters.  Gandhi's intervention highlighted the unjust conditions and successfully pressured the authorities to address the farmers' grievances.  His investigation and subsequent actions directly challenged the existing system and brought about significant reforms concerning the indigo cultivation system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Champaran Satyagraha was a significant victory, it didn't lead to the immediate nationwide abolition of the exploitative indigo plantation system. The reforms were implemented in Champaran, but the broader issue of unfair agricultural practices continued to exist in other parts of British India.  This statement overstates the immediate and widespread impact of the Satyagraha, failing to acknowledge the limitations of a localized movement in achieving nationwide change.  The Champaran Satyagraha was a crucial step, but it was not the sole determinant of changes in the indigo industry across all of British India.


**5. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's views on education, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi advocated for a system of education that prioritized English language proficiency above vernacular languages, believing it essential for global competitiveness.
2. Gandhi strongly opposed the introduction of Western scientific and technical education in India, advocating for an education system rooted solely in traditional Indian knowledge.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gandhi was a staunch advocate of vernacular education, believing that education should be imparted in the mother tongue to foster a deeper understanding and connection with one's culture and identity. While he didn't oppose English entirely, he emphasized the importance of vernacular languages as the foundation of education.  This statement misrepresents his views on language and education, emphasizing English over vernacular languages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gandhi didn't oppose Western scientific and technical education outright. His critique was directed towards an education system that neglected the holistic development of the individual and prioritized rote learning over critical thinking. He advocated for integrating Western knowledge with traditional Indian values to create a balanced and relevant education system.  This statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate depiction of his complex stance on education, falsely claiming he completely rejected Western scientific education.  He sought a synthesis of the best from both traditions.

**1. With reference to Lord Mountbatten's role in the Indian Independence, consider the following statements:**

1. Lord Mountbatten, as Viceroy, played a crucial role in the establishment of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan,  directly influencing its initial structure and composition.
2.  The Boundary Commission's report, instrumental in partitioning India, was officially released by Lord Mountbatten after the transfer of power, though it was completed before the Independence Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Mountbatten was instrumental in the creation of Pakistan. While he didn't directly draft the Constituent Assembly's framework, his actions and decisions significantly shaped its formation and early functioning.  His involvement in the negotiations leading to the Mountbatten Plan directly contributed to the establishment of a separate Constituent Assembly for Pakistan.  His position as Viceroy gave him significant influence in this process.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Boundary Commission, tasked with demarcating the borders between India and Pakistan, finalized its report before August 15th, 1947. However, Lord Mountbatten strategically delayed its public release until after the transfer of power. This decision aimed to mitigate potential violence and unrest triggered by the controversial boundary decisions, shifting responsibility for the aftermath from the British government to the newly independent nations.  This calculated delay, while controversial, was a key aspect of Mountbatten's handling of the partition.


**2. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's activities during the Indian Independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahatma Gandhi's significant influence extended to Bengal, where his political ideologies and philosophies significantly shaped the course of the independence movement within the province.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi actively supported the nomination of Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Prime Minister of India, reflecting his belief in Nehru's suitability for the role.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahatma Gandhi's influence transcended geographical boundaries.  While his direct involvement in Bengal's political affairs might not have been as constant as in Gujarat or other regions, his ideologies of non-violent resistance and Satyagraha profoundly influenced the movement's strategy and approach within Bengal. His letters, speeches, and pronouncements held significant weight, shaping the political landscape and impacting the actions of Congress leaders in Bengal.

Statement 2 is also correct. While there were differing opinions within the Congress,  Mahatma Gandhi consistently expressed his support for Jawaharlal Nehru's leadership. His preference for Nehru became increasingly evident as independence approached.  He actively worked behind the scenes to ensure Nehru’s ascendancy to the Prime Ministership, reflecting his confidence in Nehru's abilities and vision for independent India.  This support was crucial in Nehru's eventual appointment.


**3. With reference to the Indian socialist movement within the Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra Prasad, a prominent figure in the Indian National Congress, consistently championed socialist ideals and policies within the party's platform.
2. Narendra Dev, a key figure in the Congress, played a prominent role in articulating and advocating for socialist viewpoints within the Indian National Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajendra Prasad was a highly respected leader within the Congress, he was not primarily associated with the socialist wing.  His political ideology leaned more towards the centrist and moderate factions of the Congress.  He focused on national unity and constitutional methods, rather than the socialist agenda.

Statement 2 is correct. Narendra Dev was a prominent socialist leader within the Congress. He played a significant role in shaping the socialist ideology within the party and advocating for socialist policies. He was a key figure in the Congress Socialist Party, a faction dedicated to incorporating socialist principles into the Indian independence movement.  His contributions were instrumental in bringing socialist thought into the mainstream Congress discourse.


**4. With reference to literature on the Partition of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's literary works extensively explored the themes of communal violence and the human cost of the Partition.
2. Bhisham Sahni, a notable writer, included the impact of the Partition on individuals and society as a prominent theme in his literary works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, a renowned 19th-century Bengali novelist, predates the Partition of India. His works primarily focus on themes of nationalism and socio-religious reform within the context of British colonial rule, not on the Partition itself. His most famous work, *Anandamath*, is a novel about a rebellion against British rule, but it does not cover the Partition.

Statement 2 is correct. Bhisham Sahni, a prominent 20th-century writer, directly addressed the Partition's impact in his literary works.  His writings vividly portrayed the human suffering, displacement, and communal tensions that characterized the Partition, making it a central theme in his narratives.  His works offer valuable insights into the social and psychological consequences of this historical event.


**5. With reference to Indian nationalism and its relationship with Western thought, consider the following statements:**

1. Indian nationalism, although possessing unique characteristics, drew significantly from Western intellectual and political discourse, showcasing a derivative yet distinct approach.
2. Indian nationalism, as a reaction to Western imperialism, was inherently shaped and influenced by the very forces against which it was reacting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Indian nationalism, while rooted in India's unique historical and cultural context, was undeniably influenced by Western ideas.  Concepts like liberalism, democracy, and nationalism itself, originating in the West, significantly shaped the Indian nationalist movement's ideology and strategies.  However, Indian nationalism adapted and modified these Western concepts to suit its specific circumstances, resulting in a distinct form of nationalism.

Statement 2 is also correct. The nature of Indian nationalism was fundamentally shaped by its opposition to British imperialism.  The strategies, goals, and even the very definition of nationhood were influenced by the specifics of British rule and the challenges posed by it. The response to imperialism was not simply a rejection but a complex interplay of resistance, adaptation, and negotiation with the existing power structures.  The colonial context profoundly molded the form and direction of Indian nationalism.


**6. With reference to the Survey of India project, consider the following statements:**

1. The Survey of India project was launched in the 1860s by British ethnographers, primarily focusing on mapping and documenting the geographical features of India.
2.  Risley, a prominent figure associated with the Survey of India, played a significant role in its development and execution during the late 19th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Survey of India did extensively map India's geographical features, it was not launched in the 1860s by British ethnographers. The origins of the Survey of India date back much earlier, to 1767, under the British East India Company.  Its initial focus was primarily on military mapping.  Although ethnography later became a part of its work, it wasn't the primary focus at its inception, and certainly not in the 1860s.

Statement 2 is correct. Herbert Hope Risley was indeed a significant figure associated with the Survey of India. His work in the late 19th century focused on anthropological and ethnographic research, contributing to the Survey's broader understanding of India's population and its diverse communities. His contributions significantly broadened the Survey's scope beyond mere mapping.


**7. With reference to the Bengali text 'Barnaparichay', consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Rammohan Roy authored 'Barnaparichay', a significant Bengali primer that contributed to the development of Bengali language and education.
2.  'Barnaparichay', a mid-19th century Bengali text, achieved widespread use as a primary educational text during its time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Raja Rammohan Roy was a significant figure in the Bengal Renaissance and contributed greatly to education and language reform, he did not author 'Barnaparichay'.  The authorship of this text is attributed to others.  His contributions to education were significant, but this particular text wasn't one of his works.

Statement 2 is correct. 'Barnaparichay' did indeed achieve widespread use as a primary educational text in mid-19th century Bengal. It served as an important tool for teaching Bengali, playing a significant role in the development of Bengali literacy and education during that period. Its popularity and widespread use cemented its place in the history of Bengali education.


**8. With reference to the oldest regiments of the Indian Army, consider the following statements:**

1. The Madras Regiment holds the distinction of being the oldest regiment in the Indian Army.
2. The Sikh Regiment, while a significant and historically important regiment, is not the oldest in the Indian Army.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Madras Regiment, while an important and long-standing regiment, is not the oldest in the Indian Army. The claim of being the oldest is often contested among various regiments, depending on the criteria used for determining seniority.  However, the Madras Regiment is not generally considered the oldest.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sikh Regiment, while a historically very important and prestigious regiment with a strong legacy of service, is not the oldest regiment in the Indian Army.  Its establishment is later than that of other regiments.  The exact claim to the title of "oldest" is often debated, but the Sikh Regiment is not generally considered the oldest.


**9. With reference to the novels written by Nazir Ahmad and Charles Dickens, consider the following statements:**

1. Nazir Ahmad's famous novel, *Bahishti Zewar*, published in 1869, provided a critique of the adverse impact of industrialization on the poor.
2. Charles Dickens' novel, *Hard Times*, offers a critical examination of the negative consequences of industrialization on the impoverished classes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nazir Ahmad wrote *Bahishti Zewar*, a significant Urdu novel, it does not primarily focus on the critique of industrialization's impact on the poor.  The novel's themes revolve around social and religious issues within a specific community, not the broader consequences of industrialization.  The timeframe of its publication is also a point of contention, with some sources citing a later date.

Statement 2 is correct. Charles Dickens' *Hard Times* is a powerful critique of the negative social and economic effects of industrialization, specifically focusing on the plight of the working class.  The novel vividly portrays the dehumanizing conditions, social inequalities, and exploitation associated with industrial growth, making it a significant commentary on the social costs of industrial progress.


**10. With reference to Bal Gangadhar Tilak's associations and activities, consider the following statements:**

1. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was significantly involved in the founding and leadership of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, a key organization in the early stages of the Indian nationalist movement.
2. Bal Gangadhar Tilak played a prominent role in the activities of the Gaurakshini Sabha, an organization focused on protecting cows and promoting Hindu religious sentiments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was indeed a significant organization, it was founded by Mahadev Govind Ranade, not Bal Gangadhar Tilak.  Tilak was later associated with it, but he didn't found it.  The Sabha played a vital role in the early stages of the Indian nationalist movement, promoting political reform and social progress, but its founding is not directly connected to Tilak.

Statement 2 is correct. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was actively involved with the Gaurakshini Sabha, an organization dedicated to the protection of cows, a significant aspect of Hindu religious sentiment. This involvement reflects Tilak's strategy of using religious and cultural symbols to mobilize nationalist support and build a broader-based movement.  His participation in the Gaurakshini Sabha's activities was part of his larger political strategy.

**1. With reference to Bal Gangadhar Tilak's political career, consider the following statements:**

1. Tilak's newspaper, *Kesari*, primarily focused on promoting moderate nationalist views and advocating for gradual constitutional reforms within the British framework.
2.  The Ganapati and Shivaji festivals, organized by Tilak, served as significant tools for fostering a sense of Hindu unity and promoting nationalist sentiment, indirectly challenging British rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Tilak did initially engage in some constitutional politics, *Kesari* under his editorship became a platform for expressing increasingly radical nationalist views.  He advocated for Swaraj (self-rule) and actively challenged the British government through his writings, often pushing the boundaries of acceptable political discourse. He was a key figure among the Extremists within the Indian National Congress, directly opposing the moderate approach.  His articles frequently criticized British policies and inspired nationalist fervor.

Statement 2 is correct. Tilak masterfully used the Ganapati and Shivaji festivals to mobilize the masses and promote a shared Hindu identity, thereby indirectly challenging British hegemony. These festivals served as powerful tools for political mobilization, fostering a sense of national unity and inspiring resistance against foreign rule. They were not mere religious celebrations but cleverly woven into a larger nationalist agenda. The festivals provided a platform for expressing anti-British sentiments and promoting the idea of self-rule, circumventing direct confrontation while still achieving political goals.  This strategy was a significant aspect of his militant nationalism.


**2. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's early political activism, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi's first major use of the hunger strike as a political tool occurred during the Champaran Satyagraha in 1917, aiming to alleviate the plight of indigo farmers.
2.  Gandhi's initial involvement in South Africa primarily focused on advocating for the rights of Indian workers through legal channels and peaceful protests, without employing the method of hunger strikes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Gandhi did employ Satyagraha (including non-violent resistance) successfully in Champaran, his first use of a hunger strike as a tool for achieving a political goal was in South Africa in 1906, during the struggle against discriminatory laws affecting Indian immigrants.  The Champaran Satyagraha was a significant event, showcasing his effective use of non-violent civil disobedience, but not his first use of hunger strikes.

Statement 2 is correct. Although Gandhi later became famous for his hunger strikes, his early activism in South Africa primarily involved various forms of non-violent resistance, including petitions, peaceful protests, and community organizing. While he consistently challenged discriminatory practices, the hunger strike, a powerful escalation of non-violent tactics, was not immediately adopted as a central strategy. His early experiences in South Africa laid the groundwork for his later philosophy and techniques of Satyagraha, but the hunger strike was a later development.


**3. With reference to Vasudeo Balvant Phadke's revolutionary activities, consider the following statements:**

1. Phadke's primary inspiration stemmed from the reformist ideas of Jyotirao Phule and his social reform movements, advocating for the upliftment of lower castes.
2.  Phadke's revolutionary ideology was significantly shaped by his firsthand experience of the Deccan famine of 1876-77 and his witnessing of the severe economic exploitation of the peasantry.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Phadke's ideology was multifaceted,  Jyotirao Phule's reformist ideals played a significant role in shaping his views on social justice and equality.  Phule's activism against caste discrimination and his advocacy for the rights of the marginalized significantly influenced Phadke's own commitment to challenging social inequalities and advocating for the oppressed.  The connection between Phule's reformist ideas and Phadke's revolutionary actions is a crucial element in understanding his motivations.

Statement 2 is also correct. Phadke's direct experience of the devastating Deccan famine profoundly impacted his understanding of the deep-seated economic exploitation faced by the peasantry. This firsthand observation of widespread suffering fueled his revolutionary fervor and strengthened his resolve to fight against the unjust economic systems that perpetuated such hardship. The famine provided a direct and powerful impetus for his revolutionary activities, highlighting the link between economic oppression and his revolutionary goals.  His witness to the stark realities of poverty and inequality during the famine directly informed his revolutionary approach.


**4. With reference to the early Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists, often termed "Moderates," primarily employed constitutional methods of political agitation, such as petitions, public meetings, and resolutions, to convey their demands to the British government.
2.  The early nationalist movement, despite its constitutional approach, successfully mobilized widespread mass support across diverse social groups, including peasants and workers, throughout India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905) was dominated by the Moderates, who primarily relied on constitutional and legal methods to pressure the British government.  Their strategies included petitions, public meetings, resolutions passed by the Indian National Congress, and appeals to British public opinion. They operated within the existing legal framework, hoping to achieve gradual reforms through persuasion and reasoned argument. This approach contrasted sharply with the later rise of militant nationalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the early nationalists did aim to build a national consensus, their influence was largely confined to the educated urban elite.  The movement had limited penetration among the masses, particularly peasants and workers.  The later rise of figures like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and the adoption of more mass-based strategies addressed this limitation, but the early Moderate phase lacked widespread mass mobilization across diverse social strata.  The movement's base remained largely among the educated middle class.


**5. With reference to the activities of the East India Company, consider the following statements:**

1. The East India Company's initial primary objective was to establish a trade monopoly in India, gradually expanding its political control through alliances, military victories, and administrative reforms.
2.  The Company's economic policies in India consistently benefited Indian farmers and artisans, fostering economic growth and prosperity within the Indian economy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The East India Company's charter granted in 1600 initially focused on establishing a profitable trade monopoly in the East Indies, including India. Over time, however, the Company's activities expanded beyond trade. Through a combination of shrewd diplomacy, military conquests (such as the Battle of Plassey), and the gradual assumption of administrative responsibilities, the Company steadily expanded its political power, eventually controlling vast swathes of the Indian subcontinent. This transition from a trading company to a ruling power is a central theme in understanding British colonialism in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The East India Company's economic policies in India generally served the interests of the British, often at the expense of Indian farmers and artisans.  Policies like the Permanent Settlement and the revenue systems implemented by the Company often led to the impoverishment of the peasantry.  The Company's focus on maximizing profits for its shareholders led to the exploitation of India's resources and the disruption of traditional Indian industries, resulting in significant economic hardship for many segments of Indian society. The Company's economic policies were fundamentally extractive, designed to benefit British interests rather than promoting Indian economic development.

**1. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act introduced a system of bicameral legislatures at both the federal and provincial levels, with the upper house possessing more powers than the lower house.
2.  The Act established a Federal Court with limited appellate jurisdiction, subordinate to the Privy Council in London.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, was a landmark piece of legislation that significantly reshaped the Indian political landscape.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act did indeed introduce bicameral legislatures at both the federal and provincial levels (Council of States and Federal Assembly at the center, and Legislative Councils and Legislative Assemblies in the provinces),  the upper houses (Council of States and Legislative Councils) did *not* possess more power than the lower houses. The lower houses held greater legislative power. The upper houses acted as a check and balance, possessing some delaying powers but ultimately deferring to the lower house's legislative authority. This structure aimed to balance the interests of different groups while ensuring the effectiveness of the legislative process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act established a Federal Court, a significant step towards judicial autonomy within India. However, it's crucial to understand that this court's powers were limited.  The Privy Council in London retained ultimate appellate authority. This reflected the continuing limitations on Indian self-governance under British rule, even within the framework of the 1935 Act.  The Federal Court, though a step forward, did not fully represent Indian judicial independence. The continued supremacy of the Privy Council highlights the constraints placed upon India's autonomy within the British Empire.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Government of India Act, 1935 on local self-government, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act significantly expanded the financial resources available to local bodies, enabling them to undertake more ambitious development projects.
2. The Act granted enhanced autonomy to local bodies in matters of taxation, allowing them to levy taxes without significant central government oversight.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, while introducing significant constitutional changes, had a complex and somewhat contradictory impact on local self-governing institutions. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act aimed to improve local self-government, it did not lead to a significant expansion of financial resources for local bodies.  In fact, the demarcation of taxation powers between provincial and local governments often resulted in limited resources for local bodies.  The Act's focus on provincial autonomy often overshadowed the needs of local-level governance, leading to resource constraints at the grassroots level. This reflects the inherent complexities of implementing large-scale constitutional changes within a pre-existing administrative structure.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Act did not grant enhanced autonomy to local bodies in taxation.  Instead, it often restricted their power to levy taxes,  The Act's provisions aimed to maintain a degree of central control over local finances, which sometimes conflicted with the principle of greater autonomy for local self-governing bodies. The Act's impact on local taxation reveals the tension between the desire for greater decentralization and the need to maintain overall financial stability and control within the British Indian system.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Nehru Report (1928):**

1. The Nehru Report advocated for the establishment of a unitary government in India, rejecting the idea of a federal structure.
2. The Report proposed adult suffrage as the basis for elections to the legislatures, ensuring universal adult franchise.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Nehru Report, drafted by a committee headed by Motilal Nehru in 1928, was a significant attempt to propose a constitutional framework for India. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nehru Report explicitly advocated for a federal structure for India, not a unitary one. It proposed a federation based on linguistic provinces and provincial autonomy, reflecting the growing demand for greater self-governance at the provincial level.  Rejecting a unitary system demonstrated the report's recognition of the diverse regional identities and interests within India. This approach to federalism aimed to balance national unity with regional autonomy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Nehru Report was remarkable for its forward-looking approach to electoral reform. It proposed adult suffrage as the basis for elections, advocating for universal adult franchise. This was a significant departure from the existing limited franchise system and reflected the growing democratic aspirations within the Indian National Congress.  The proposal for adult suffrage showcased the report's commitment to a truly representative and inclusive political system.  The adoption of adult suffrage was a key element in the report's vision for a modern, democratic India.


**4. With reference to the Indian Independence Act, 1947, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act provided for the immediate partition of British India into India and Pakistan, with the exact boundaries to be determined later by a Boundary Commission.
2. The Act granted dominion status to both India and Pakistan, allowing them to become self-governing members of the British Commonwealth.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Independence Act of 1947 was a pivotal piece of legislation that brought an end to British rule in India. Statement 1 is correct. The Act did indeed provide for the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. However, the crucial point is that the exact boundaries were not immediately defined.  A Boundary Commission, headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, was appointed to demarcate the borders between the two newly independent nations. This process proved highly contentious and led to widespread violence and displacement during the partition. The delayed demarcation of boundaries highlights the rushed nature of the partition process and its devastating consequences.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act, in its essence, granted dominion status to both India and Pakistan. This meant that both nations achieved self-governance and became independent sovereign states.  They were also given the option to remain within the British Commonwealth, a testament to the evolving nature of the British Empire's relationship with its former colonies. The grant of dominion status marked a significant shift in the global power dynamics, symbolizing the end of an era of British imperial rule.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935 and the Communal Award (1932), consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India Act, 1935, fully implemented the provisions of the Communal Award, including separate electorates for all minority communities.
2. The Poona Pact (1932) resulted in the complete abandonment of separate electorates for the depressed classes, replacing them with reserved seats in joint electorates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, and the Communal Award of 1932, along with the Poona Pact, represent a complex interplay of political negotiations and compromises during the final years of British rule in India.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1935, did *not* fully implement all provisions of the Communal Award. While the Act incorporated some elements of the Award, it notably did *not* retain separate electorates for all minority communities as originally proposed.  The Poona Pact, which replaced separate electorates for the depressed classes with reserved seats in joint electorates, significantly altered the Award's initial provisions. This demonstrates the dynamic nature of political negotiations and compromises in the lead-up to Indian independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Poona Pact, signed after Gandhi's fast, resulted in a crucial modification to the Communal Award. Separate electorates for the depressed classes were abandoned, replaced by a system of reserved seats within joint electorates. This reflected a compromise between Gandhi's vision of Hindu unity and Ambedkar's efforts to secure political representation for the depressed classes. The Poona Pact, while a compromise, had lasting implications for the representation of Dalits in the Indian political system.

**1. With reference to the early Indian National Congress (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Councils Act of 1892, a direct response to Congress demands, granted Indians a majority in the legislative councils and complete control over the budget.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his economic critique of British rule, famously articulated the "drain of wealth" theory, highlighting the exploitation of India's resources.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the legislative councils and allow for some indirect Indian representation, it did *not* grant Indians a majority.  Officials retained a significant majority, limiting the actual power of Indian members. Furthermore, the budget could be discussed but not voted upon or amended, demonstrating a continued lack of substantial control over finances.  This statement misrepresents the limited nature of the reforms granted.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's profound analysis of British economic policies in India is a cornerstone of early nationalist thought. His "drain of wealth" theory, meticulously documented, argued that British policies systematically extracted India's resources, leading to its impoverishment. This theory remains a significant contribution to understanding the economic dimensions of colonial rule and its impact on India's development.  The statement accurately reflects a key aspect of Naoroji's work and its lasting influence.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**2. With reference to Subhas Chandra Bose's political ideology and actions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bose wholeheartedly embraced Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance throughout his political career, viewing it as the most effective means to achieve Indian independence.
2.  Bose's formation of the Forward Bloc stemmed from his disagreement with the Congress leadership's approach to the struggle for independence and his advocacy for a more militant strategy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Subhas Chandra Bose's political trajectory diverged significantly from Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance. While initially working within the Congress framework, Bose increasingly advocated for a more assertive and, ultimately, militaristic approach to achieving independence.  His collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II starkly demonstrates this departure from Gandhian principles. This statement presents a fundamentally inaccurate portrayal of Bose's ideology.

Statement 2 is correct. The Forward Bloc's creation directly resulted from the deep ideological and strategic differences between Bose and the dominant leadership within the Indian National Congress.  Bose's belief in the necessity of a more aggressive and potentially violent struggle for independence, as opposed to Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent civil disobedience, fueled this split and the formation of a separate political entity. The statement correctly identifies the core reason behind the Forward Bloc's emergence.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**3. With reference to the Cripps Mission of 1942, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps Mission's proposals explicitly guaranteed complete independence for India immediately upon the conclusion of World War II, addressing the Congress's primary demand.
2.  The Muslim League's rejection of the Cripps Mission's proposals stemmed primarily from its dissatisfaction with the plan for a unified Indian Union and its desire for a separate Muslim state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission offered dominion status for India after the war, not immediate complete independence. This crucial distinction was a major point of contention with the Congress, which demanded immediate independence. The statement misrepresents a key aspect of the Cripps proposals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Muslim League's opposition to the Cripps Mission stemmed largely from its concerns about the plan for a unified India. The proposal allowed provinces to opt out of the proposed Indian Union, which the League interpreted as a potential pathway to the creation of Pakistan.  The League's desire for a separate Muslim state was a central factor in its rejection of the Cripps proposals. The statement accurately highlights a major reason behind the League's negative response.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the early nationalists' economic critique of British rule:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily focused on promoting industrialization as the sole solution to India's economic woes, neglecting the importance of agricultural reform.
2.  The "drain of wealth" theory, popularized by Dadabhai Naoroji and others, argued that British policies resulted in the systematic transfer of India's resources to Britain.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While early nationalists did advocate for industrial development to counter India's economic backwardness, they also recognized the crucial role of agriculture and advocated for reforms in land revenue systems and agricultural practices to alleviate peasant distress.  The statement oversimplifies the early nationalists' economic vision by focusing solely on industrialization.

Statement 2 is correct. The "drain of wealth" theory was a central component of the early nationalists' economic critique.  This theory, articulated by prominent figures like Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt, and Dinshaw Wacha, detailed how British policies led to the systematic extraction of India's resources and wealth, contributing to its economic impoverishment. The statement accurately describes a core element of the nationalists' economic analysis. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**5. With reference to the activities of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The HSRA primarily focused on non-violent methods of protest and civil disobedience, aligning itself closely with Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy.
2.  Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru, prominent members of the HSRA, were executed in 1931 following their involvement in the assassination of a British police officer.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HSRA, unlike Gandhi's approach, was a revolutionary organization that employed violent methods, including assassinations and bombings, as a means of achieving independence. This statement fundamentally misrepresents the HSRA's tactics and ideology.

Statement 2 is correct. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru, key figures in the HSRA, were executed in 1931 after being found guilty of involvement in the assassination of a British police officer, John Saunders.  Their execution became a symbol of revolutionary defiance against British rule. The statement accurately reflects a significant event in the history of the HSRA and the Indian independence movement. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**6. With reference to the Muslim League's role in the Indian independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Muslim League consistently supported the Indian National Congress's demands for complete independence throughout the 1930s and 1940s, working collaboratively towards a unified India.
2. The Lahore Resolution of 1940, also known as the Pakistan Resolution, formally articulated the Muslim League's demand for a separate Muslim state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress was complex and often fraught with tension. While there were periods of cooperation, particularly during the early years of the nationalist movement, the League increasingly pursued its own agenda, culminating in the demand for a separate Muslim state.  This statement presents a significantly oversimplified and inaccurate depiction of the League's relationship with the Congress.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lahore Resolution of 1940, passed at the annual session of the Muslim League, is a landmark event in the history of the Indian subcontinent. This resolution formally proposed the creation of independent states in Muslim-majority areas of India, marking a decisive step towards the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.  The statement accurately describes a pivotal moment in the Muslim League's history and its impact on the course of the Indian independence movement. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**7. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant legislative powers to the provinces, while retaining central control over defense and foreign affairs.
2. The Act established a bicameral legislature at the center, with the upper house (Council of States) composed entirely of elected members.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 is a significant piece of legislation in the history of British India.  A key feature of the Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy, transferring considerable legislative power to the provinces. However, the central government retained control over crucial areas such as defense and foreign affairs, reflecting the continued dominance of British authority. The statement accurately captures this key feature of the Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act did establish a bicameral legislature at the center, comprising the Council of States (upper house) and the House of the People (lower house). However, the Council of States was *not* composed entirely of elected members; some members were nominated.  This statement incorrectly describes the composition of the Council of States.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Moderate phase of the Indian National Congress:**

1. The Moderates primarily employed non-constitutional methods of protest, such as boycotts and civil disobedience, to pressure the British government.
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent Moderate leader, advocated for self-government within the British Empire, drawing parallels with the self-governing dominions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Moderates, in contrast to later phases of the nationalist movement, primarily focused on constitutional means of political engagement.  Their methods included petitions, resolutions, and working within the existing legislative framework to advocate for reforms.  The statement mischaracterizes the Moderate approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a prominent figure in the Moderate phase and a significant voice advocating for self-government within the British Empire. He drew comparisons with self-governing colonies like Canada and Australia, illustrating a path towards greater Indian autonomy while remaining within the British imperial structure. The statement accurately reflects Gokhale's political vision. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**9. With reference to the Salt Satyagraha of 1930, consider the following statements:**

1. The Salt Satyagraha was primarily organized and led by Subhas Chandra Bose, showcasing his commitment to a militant approach to the freedom struggle.
2.  The Salt Satyagraha involved a symbolic march to Dandi, where Gandhi defied the British salt tax, galvanizing mass participation in the movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement, the Salt Satyagraha of 1930 was primarily conceived and led by Mahatma Gandhi.  Bose's leadership style and approach differed significantly from Gandhi's, and this statement incorrectly attributes the leadership of the Salt Satyagraha to Bose.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Salt Satyagraha is a defining moment in the Indian independence movement.  A key element of this campaign was the symbolic march to Dandi, where Gandhi and his followers defied the British salt tax, making salt illegally, thereby directly challenging British authority and sparking widespread civil disobedience.  The statement accurately describes a central feature of the Salt Satyagraha and its impact.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**10. With reference to the differences between Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Both Gandhi and Bose were staunch opponents of socialism and communism, preferring a capitalist economic model for independent India.
2.  Gandhi and Bose differed significantly in their approaches to the freedom struggle, with Gandhi emphasizing non-violent resistance and Bose advocating for a more militant approach.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both Gandhi and Bose, while differing in their specific interpretations, expressed support for socialist principles.  Gandhi's vision of *Sarvodaya* (upliftment of all) encompassed elements of socialism, although he rejected the Western model associated with industrialization. Bose, while initially advocating for a synthesis of socialism and fascism (Samyavada), later strongly identified with socialist ideals.  Both opposed unfettered capitalism and viewed it as exploitative.  This statement incorrectly portrays their stance on socialism.

Statement 2 is correct. The most significant difference between Gandhi and Bose lay in their approaches to the freedom struggle. Gandhi's philosophy centered on non-violent resistance (Satyagraha), while Bose favored a more aggressive and potentially violent approach, ultimately leading to his collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II. This statement accurately captures a fundamental divergence in their strategies and ideologies. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. With reference to the Bundelkhand region, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Khuntkatti land tenure system, prevalent during British rule, was primarily characterized by individual ownership of land parcels, unlike the prevalent Zamindari system.
2.  Bundelkhand's strategic location, bordering several significant historical empires, led to frequent conflicts and changes in its political control throughout history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Khuntkatti tenure system in Bundelkhand was a form of communal land ownership, not individual ownership.  It involved a village community collectively owning and managing land, distributing it amongst its members according to customary rules. This contrasts sharply with the Zamindari system, where ownership was vested in a single landlord.  The statement confuses Khuntkatti with other land tenure systems that emphasized individual rights.

Statement 2 is correct. Bundelkhand's geographical position placed it at the crossroads of several powerful empires and kingdoms.  The Pratiharas fought in the region, the Sharqi Sultanate bordered it, and various Rajput clans and Maratha rulers contended for control. This led to continuous power struggles and shifting allegiances, making it a strategically crucial area throughout its history. The frequent changes in political control highlight its importance as a contested territory.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of European powers on India:**

1.  Napoleon Bonaparte's assertion about India's commerce dominating world trade underscores the economic significance of India even before the peak of British colonial rule.
2. Queen Victoria's reign saw the complete dismantling of the existing Indian economic systems, replacing them entirely with a new British-centric model.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Napoleon Bonaparte's quote highlights the immense economic importance of India's trade in global markets, a fact acknowledged by European powers long before the British solidified their colonial dominance.  His statement reflects the strategic value placed on controlling Indian commerce, which was seen as crucial for European economic and political power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Queen Victoria's reign witnessed significant British economic influence and exploitation of India's resources, it's inaccurate to say that existing Indian economic systems were completely dismantled and replaced.  Traditional systems like the Zamindari system coexisted with the British-introduced ones, and indigenous industries and trade continued, albeit under severe pressure from British policies.  The British imposed their systems alongside, not entirely replacing pre-existing structures.


**3. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's life and activism, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhiji's adoption of a loincloth and shaving his head during his South Indian tour of 1921 symbolized his rejection of all forms of Western influence and a complete embrace of traditional Indian attire.
2.  The Champaran Satyagraha was primarily focused on addressing the grievances of indigo farmers against oppressive British plantation owners, significantly shaping Gandhi's leadership style.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhiji's adoption of simple attire during his South Indian tour of 1921 symbolized his identification with the poor and his rejection of ostentatious living,  it didn't represent a complete rejection of Western influence nor a rigid adherence to only traditional Indian clothing. His choices were strategic moves to connect with the masses,  not a blanket rejection of all Western aspects.

Statement 2 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha successfully addressed the grievances of indigo farmers who were exploited by British planters through unfair contracts and forced cultivation.  This campaign marked a turning point in Gandhi's career, showcasing his effective use of Satyagraha and his growing influence on the Indian masses.  It established his leadership style, emphasizing non-violent resistance and mobilization of rural communities.


**4. With reference to Simla and its historical significance, consider the following statements:**

1. Simla's establishment as a hill station primarily served as a retreat for the British elite to escape the summer heat, with minimal strategic military considerations.
2. The Anglo-Afghan Wars played a crucial role in shaping the strategic importance of Simla as a military base and administrative center.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Simla did become a popular summer retreat for the British, its initial establishment as a hill station was driven significantly by strategic military reasons.  Its location provided a vantage point for monitoring the frontier regions and facilitating military operations. The escape from the heat was a secondary benefit that grew over time.

Statement 2 is correct. The Anglo-Afghan Wars highlighted the need for a strong British military presence in the north-western regions of India. Simla's location, offering a cooler climate and proximity to strategic areas, made it an ideal base for troops, administration, and launching campaigns.  The wars directly contributed to Simla's development as a crucial military and administrative centre.


**5. With reference to Subhas Chandra Bose's activities during World War II, consider the following statements:**

1.  Subhas Chandra Bose primarily operated Azad Hind Radio from Germany, leveraging its propaganda machinery to garner support for the Indian independence movement.
2.  The Azad Hind Fauj, under Bose's leadership, received significant military and financial support from the Axis powers, particularly Japan, to fight against the British in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Subhas Chandra Bose did use Azad Hind Radio for propaganda from Germany initially, he later shifted its operations to South-East Asia, specifically under Japanese occupation. The statement needs correction because it does not mention the shifting of operations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Azad Hind Fauj (INA) received substantial support from the Axis powers, particularly Japan, in terms of military training, weaponry, and funding.  Japan, seeking to expand its influence in Asia, saw the INA as a useful tool to weaken British power in the region. The support provided was instrumental in the INA’s operations against the British.


**6.  With reference to the Eka Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Eka Movement, led by Bhagwan Ahir, primarily focused on the economic grievances of peasants in Awadh, advocating for rent reduction and land reforms.
2. The movement's success in achieving its goals significantly weakened the influence of the Congress in Awadh during the 1920s.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Eka Movement did address peasant grievances in Awadh, it was primarily led by Madari Pasi, not Bhagwan Ahir.  The movement focused on issues of high rents, sharecropping, and oppression by local landlords (thikadars).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Eka Movement, while significant, did not significantly weaken the Congress's influence in Awadh.  The movement's impact was localized and did not lead to a major decline in the Congress's overall standing in the region. The Congress continued to maintain a presence in the region.


**7. With reference to Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, consider the following statements:**

1. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan strongly advocated for a separate Muslim electorate, believing that Muslim interests could not be adequately represented within a unified Indian political system.
2. He envisioned an Indian nation-state based on individual citizen's rights, but he did not believe in the political unity of Hindus and Muslims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sir Syed Ahmed Khan initially advocated for separate Muslim representation due to concerns about Muslim minority rights,  his approach was not a direct call for a separate electorate.  His primary focus was on securing Muslim interests within a broader Indian framework. It was later that the demand for separate electorate became mainstream.

Statement 2 is correct. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan believed in individual rights and a modern nation-state, but his vision didn't include the immediate political unification of Hindus and Muslims.  He saw cultural and religious differences as significant factors and believed that Muslims needed separate educational and social institutions to protect their identity before participating in a unified political structure. His approach was cautious and focused on gradual integration.


**8.  Consider the following statements about the 18th-century Indian social structure:**

1. The caste system in 18th-century India was strictly hierarchical, with inter-caste dining and marriage being completely absent.
2.  The practice of Sati was uniformly prevalent across all regions and social classes in 18th-century India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the caste system in 18th-century India was hierarchical and strictly regulated social interactions,  it’s inaccurate to claim that inter-caste dining and marriage were completely absent.  There were variations across regions and castes, and some degree of interaction did occur, though it was often limited and subject to strict rules.  Complete absence is an overstatement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The practice of Sati, while a significant social evil, was not uniformly prevalent across all regions and social classes. It was more common in certain parts of northern India, particularly among the upper castes and elite families.  In the South and among some communities, it was less prevalent or even absent.  Uniform prevalence is an inaccurate generalization.

**1. With reference to the social reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prarthana Samaj, primarily active in Bombay, advocated for widow remarriage and women's education, but remained largely unconcerned with religious reforms.
2.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, vehemently opposed idolatry and caste rigidity, while promoting a return to Vedic principles and emphasizing the infallibility of the Vedas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Prarthana Samaj, established in Bombay, focused significantly on social reforms like widow remarriage and women's education. While it promoted monotheism, its primary concern remained societal issues rather than extensive religious reform within Hinduism.  It worked through persuasion and education, avoiding direct confrontation with orthodox Hindu practices.  Its association with the Bhakti cult of Maharashtra further highlights its emphasis on social rather than strictly theological matters.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, was a significant Hindu reform movement that strongly criticized idolatry, caste rigidity, and what it perceived as the perversions of Hindu religion by later scriptures and priestly practices.  It advocated a return to Vedic principles, considering the Vedas as infallible and the ultimate source of truth. This emphasis on Vedic authority, while advocating for social reform, gave its teachings a decidedly orthodox character, contrasting with the more liberal approaches of movements like the Brahmo Samaj.  The Arya Samaj's insistence on Vedic infallibility demonstrates a key difference in approach compared to other reform movements.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the contributions of Swami Vivekananda:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago (1893) primarily focused on the superiority of Vedanta philosophy over other religious traditions.
2.  The Ramakrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda, emphasized both spiritual development and social service, extending its activities to education, healthcare, and disaster relief.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda did present Vedanta philosophy at the Parliament of the World's Religions, his primary focus was on highlighting the universality of religious experience and the underlying unity of all faiths. He emphasized the need for a synthesis of Eastern spirituality and Western materialism, rather than asserting the superiority of one tradition over others.  His message resonated with a global audience due to its inclusive and harmonious nature, not a claim of dominance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ramakrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda, is a notable example of an organization that successfully combined spiritual teachings with extensive social service.  The Mission's activities have encompassed a wide range of philanthropic endeavors, including establishing educational institutions, hospitals, and dispensaries, and providing relief during natural calamities. This practical application of spiritual principles demonstrates a distinct characteristic of the Ramakrishna Mission and its lasting impact on Indian society.


**3. With reference to the Brahmo Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Brahmo Samaj, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, initially focused solely on religious reform, rejecting all social reform efforts as outside its purview.
2.  Keshab Chandra Sen's leadership of the Brahmo Samaj saw the movement expand significantly beyond Bengal, but also led to internal divisions due to his more radical views on social issues.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Brahmo Samaj's primary aim was religious reform, focusing on monotheism and the rejection of idolatry and meaningless rituals, its activities were inextricably linked to social reform.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy himself actively campaigned against sati and advocated for women's rights and education. The Brahmo Samaj's critique of caste rigidity and its support for widow remarriage demonstrates its holistic approach to societal transformation.

Statement 2 is correct. Keshab Chandra Sen's leadership marked a period of significant growth for the Brahmo Samaj, with branches established across India. However, his more radical social views, including his outspoken opposition to caste and his advocacy for inter-caste marriages, caused considerable friction with more conservative members, ultimately leading to divisions and the formation of separate Brahmo Samaj factions. This internal conflict highlights the tensions between religious and social reform within the movement itself.


**4. With reference to the Aligarh Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of the Aligarh Movement, advocated for complete separation of religious and political affairs, rejecting any involvement of Muslims in Indian nationalist politics.
2.  The Aligarh Movement primarily focused on promoting Western-style education among Indian Muslims while simultaneously advocating for social reforms within the Muslim community.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sir Syed Ahmad Khan initially advocated for Muslims to focus on education and economic advancement before engaging actively in politics,  he did not advocate for complete separation of religious and political spheres.  His later actions and pronouncements reveal a more nuanced position, particularly regarding the need for Muslim representation and safeguarding of their interests within the broader political context of India. His actions were influenced by the political climate and his concerns about the potential marginalization of Muslims in a rapidly evolving political landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. The Aligarh Movement, spearheaded by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, was primarily focused on modernizing Muslim society through the introduction of Western-style education.  The establishment of the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College (later Aligarh Muslim University) was central to this effort.  Simultaneously, the movement also advocated for social reforms within the Muslim community, addressing issues such as the purdah system, polygamy, and women's education. This dual focus on education and social reform represents the core aims of the Aligarh Movement.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the impact of the 19th-century social reform movements:**

1.  The social reform movements successfully eradicated caste discrimination and untouchability throughout India by the end of the 19th century.
2.  While these movements generated significant social change, they often faced limitations due to their predominantly urban and middle-class base, neglecting the concerns of the rural peasantry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the 19th-century social reform movements significantly challenged caste discrimination and untouchability, they did not fully eradicate these deeply entrenched social evils by the end of the century.  The persistence of these practices into the 20th century demonstrates the limitations of the reform movements' reach and impact, despite their considerable efforts.  While progress was made, complete eradication remained a long-term goal.

Statement 2 is correct.  A significant limitation of many 19th-century social reform movements was their concentrated focus on urban areas and the educated middle classes. This limited their reach and understanding of the diverse challenges faced by the vast rural population, particularly the peasantry.  The movements' limited engagement with rural issues resulted in a gap between their reformist ideals and the realities of rural life, hindering their broader impact on Indian society.  This limited outreach is a key factor in analyzing the success and failures of these movements.

**1. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement primarily focused on boycotting British-made textiles and salt, while largely neglecting other sectors of the British economy.
2.  Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar, a prominent figure of the movement, primarily focused his efforts on promoting indigenous industries in Bengal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the boycott of Manchester cloth and Liverpool salt was a significant aspect of the Swadeshi Movement, it encompassed a broader range of actions.  The movement aimed at a more comprehensive boycott of British goods and institutions, including educational institutions, government services, and courts. This was a strategy to cripple the British economic and administrative control over India, not just limit the boycott to select goods.  The movement’s scope extended beyond just textiles and salt to encompass a wider range of economic and political actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar was indeed a prominent figure in the Swadeshi Movement, his contributions weren't limited to Bengal. His efforts extended across different regions of India, focusing on the revival of indigenous industries and promoting swadeshi (national) products.  The movement's reach was pan-Indian, and many leaders like Deuskar worked to establish swadeshi industries across various parts of the country, not just Bengal.


**2. With reference to the participants and ideologies within the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement exclusively involved extremists from within the Indian National Congress, with no participation from moderate factions.
2.  The movement's ideology was unified, characterized solely by a commitment to political extremism and revolutionary activities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swadeshi Movement, while largely driven by extremist factions within the Indian National Congress, also saw participation from moderate nationalists, albeit with differing approaches and levels of involvement.  The Moderates, though opposing the more radical methods, supported the core concept of swadeshi and participated in the boycott of British goods to varying degrees.  The movement wasn't a monolithic entity; it involved a spectrum of political ideologies and approaches within the Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ideology of the Swadeshi Movement was far from unified. While political extremism and revolutionary activities were prominent features, particularly amongst the Garam Dal (extremists), the movement also encompassed other ideologies such as conservative moderation, incipient socialism, and various forms of nationalism.  The diverse nature of the movement reflects the complex and multifaceted nature of Indian nationalism at the time.


**3. With reference to the impact and consequences of the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement led to the immediate establishment of numerous large-scale, modern Swadeshi textile mills across India, significantly impacting British textile dominance.
2. The movement’s call for boycotting British educational institutions resulted in the immediate establishment of numerous alternative Indian educational institutions across the country, effectively replacing the British system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Swadeshi Movement did stimulate the growth of indigenous industries and the establishment of Swadeshi textile mills, the impact was gradual and not immediate.  The establishment of large-scale, modern mills took time and considerable investment, and it didn't instantly replace British dominance in the textile industry.  The movement laid the groundwork for future industrial development, but the transformation wasn't immediate or sweeping.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The boycott of British educational institutions, while a key component of the Swadeshi Movement, did not lead to the immediate replacement of the British system with a fully functioning, nationwide alternative.  The movement fostered the creation of alternative institutions like the National Council of Education, but these were localized efforts and didn't instantly replace the established British educational infrastructure. The creation of new institutions was a long-term process that built upon the momentum generated by the Swadeshi Movement.


**4. With reference to the geographical spread and leadership of the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swadeshi Movement was largely confined to Bengal, with minimal participation from other regions of India.
2.  The movement was solely led by extremist leaders like Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal, with no significant contribution from moderate leaders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Swadeshi Movement originated in Bengal as a response to the Partition of Bengal, its influence and participation extended far beyond Bengal.  The movement's impact was felt across various regions of India, with participation from diverse groups and leaders. The movement's nationalist sentiment resonated with people across the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While extremist leaders like Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal played a crucial role, the movement wasn't solely led by them.  Moderate leaders within the Indian National Congress also actively participated, albeit with differing strategies and approaches. Leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, though advocating for a more moderate approach, were still important players in the overall nationalist movement. The leadership was diverse and reflected the varied facets of the nationalist movement.


**5.  With reference to the social groups involved in the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement saw significant participation from Muslim merchants and the wider Muslim community, forming a crucial part of the movement's strength.
2.  The movement primarily involved educated urban elites, with minimal participation from peasants and workers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some Muslim individuals participated, the Swadeshi movement's participation from the Muslim community was limited, particularly compared to the Hindu community's involvement.  The movement's Hindu nationalist undertones and the religious symbolism employed alienated some sections of the Muslim population. Religious differences and separate political interests limited the extent of Muslim participation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Swadeshi Movement predominantly involved educated urban elites, students, and professionals.  While there was some participation from peasants and workers, their involvement was less pronounced compared to the urban middle and upper classes. The movement's initial focus was on the educated urban population, who played a key role in disseminating the movement's message and mobilizing support.  The limited reach to rural areas contributed to the movement's eventual limitations.

**1. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Association, founded in 1876, primarily focused on advocating for administrative reforms and greater Indian participation in the civil service, while initially maintaining a constitutional approach to political change.
2.  The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, established in the 1870s, primarily focused on criticizing administrative and legislative measures through a quarterly journal, thereby contributing to the intellectual development of the nationalist movement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the activities and focus of the Indian Association and the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha during the moderate phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905).  The Indian Association, led by figures like Surendranath Banerjea and Anandamohan Bose, actively campaigned for civil service reforms, aiming to increase Indian representation and improve administrative practices.  Their approach was largely constitutional, relying on petitions, public speeches, and reasoned arguments to influence British policy.  This aligns perfectly with statement 1.

Statement 2 correctly describes the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha's role.  Founded by Justice Ranade and others, this organization played a significant role in shaping the intellectual landscape of the nationalist movement.  Its quarterly journal served as a platform for critical analysis of British administrative and legislative actions, fostering intellectual discourse and contributing to the development of nationalist thought.  The Sabha's focus on reasoned critique and dissemination of ideas through publication is consistent with the moderate approach of the era. Therefore, both statements are factually accurate and represent key aspects of the early nationalist movement in India.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced dyarchy, a system of dual governance, in certain provinces, dividing administrative powers between Indian ministers and British officials.
2.  The Act significantly expanded the franchise, granting voting rights to a substantially larger section of the Indian population, irrespective of property ownership or literacy levels.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced dyarchy in several provinces.  This system divided administrative responsibilities, with certain subjects (like education and local self-government) placed under the control of Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures, while others (like law and order and finance) remained under the direct control of British officials. This dual system aimed to provide Indians with some degree of administrative experience while maintaining British control over key areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 1919 Act did expand the franchise compared to previous acts, it did not grant voting rights to a substantially larger section of the Indian population *irrespective* of property ownership or literacy.  The franchise remained limited, primarily based on property ownership, income, or educational qualifications.  A significant portion of the Indian population, particularly the rural masses, remained disenfranchised.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects a key feature of the Government of India Act, 1919. The limited expansion of the franchise highlights the cautious and gradual approach of the British towards political reforms in India at that time.


**3.  With reference to the views and actions of Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi advocated for complete independence ("Poorna Swaraj") as the ultimate goal for India, though their approaches to achieving this goal differed significantly.
2.  While Gandhi strongly opposed any collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II, Bose believed in exploring all possible alliances to secure India's independence, even if it meant collaborating with regimes he ideologically opposed.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately capture a fundamental difference in the approaches of Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi.  Statement 1 correctly notes their shared ultimate goal of complete independence.  Both leaders, at different points in their careers, explicitly championed "Poorna Swaraj" as the objective of the Indian national movement. However, their strategies for achieving this goal differed dramatically.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence and his strong moral opposition to the ideologies and actions of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan are well-documented. He would not countenance any alliance with these regimes. In contrast, Bose, while also advocating for freedom and equality, adopted a more pragmatic and even opportunistic approach.  He saw World War II as an opportunity to exploit the weakness of the British Empire and sought alliances with the Axis powers, including Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, to achieve his goal of Indian independence, despite his reservations about their ideologies.  The stark contrast in their approaches to alliances during the war showcases their differing political philosophies and strategies.


**4. With reference to the impact of British revenue policies on Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Permanent Settlement, while aiming to provide stability, resulted in the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few zamindars, leading to widespread tenant exploitation and agricultural stagnation in many areas.
2. The Ryotwari System, intended to collect revenue directly from individual cultivators, often led to overassessment of land revenue, forcing many peasants into debt and impoverishment, particularly during periods of drought or famine.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the negative consequences of two major British revenue systems in India.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the flaws of the Permanent Settlement.  While designed to create a stable revenue stream for the British, it led to the concentration of land ownership among a relatively small number of zamindars.  These zamindars, often absentee landlords, focused on maximizing their profits by extracting high rents from tenant cultivators, leading to widespread exploitation and hindering agricultural development.  The lack of investment in land improvement and the resulting agricultural stagnation were significant consequences.

Statement 2 is equally accurate in its assessment of the Ryotwari System.  While aiming for direct revenue collection from cultivators, the system suffered from significant flaws in land assessment.  Revenue demands were often overestimated, leaving many peasants struggling to meet their tax obligations, especially during lean years. This led to widespread indebtedness, impoverishment, and dispossession of land. The vulnerability of peasants to economic hardship under this system is a key aspect of its impact.  Therefore, the combined consequences of both systems contributed significantly to the economic distress of the Indian peasantry.


**5. With reference to the early phases of Indian nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy is credited with initiating the earliest organized agitation for political reforms in India, preceding the formation of the Indian National Congress.
2.  The British India Association, formed through a merger of several regional associations, initially focused primarily on promoting the interests of landlords and wealthy elites, before expanding its scope to broader public concerns.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Raja Ram Mohan Roy is widely recognized as a pioneer of modern Indian nationalism.  He was a key figure in advocating for social and religious reforms, and his efforts also extended to political reform, making him a precursor to the organized nationalist movement that gained momentum with the establishment of the Indian National Congress.  His early activism and advocacy for political change set the stage for later nationalist leaders.

Statement 2 is partially correct but ultimately misleading in its emphasis. While the British India Association did indeed emerge from a merger of regional associations, including those with a predominantly landlord base, the assertion that it *initially* focused *primarily* on landlord interests is an oversimplification.  From its inception, the association aimed to address broader public concerns alongside the interests of wealthy elites.  The initial emphasis on landlord interests was not the exclusive or primary focus, as the association's goals encompassed a wider range of issues relating to Indian welfare and administration.  Therefore, only statement 1 provides a completely accurate representation of a key historical figure and his role in the early development of Indian nationalism.  The nuanced nature of the British India Association's evolution makes statement 2 less precise and therefore less suitable as a definitive statement.

**1. With reference to Dadabhai Naoroji's contributions to Indian nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji served as the President of the Indian National Congress on three separate occasions.
2.  He is primarily known for his articulation of the "Drain of Wealth" theory, highlighting the economic exploitation of India under British rule.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent figure in the early Indian nationalist movement.  Statement 2 is accurate; he is renowned for his pioneering work on the "Drain of Wealth" theory, which meticulously documented the economic exploitation of India by the British Raj. This theory, detailed in his book *Poverty and Un-British Rule in India*, significantly influenced the nationalist discourse by quantifying the economic burden on India and fueling the demand for self-governance.  Statement 1 is also correct. While the exact number of times he presided over the Indian National Congress is debated (some sources mention two, others three), it's undeniable that he held the presidency multiple times, showcasing his leadership and influence within the organization during its formative years. His presidency reflects his significant contribution to the organizational development and strategic direction of the Congress. The other options are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect aspects of Naoroji's substantial contributions to Indian nationalism.


**2. With reference to the Indian independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Movement was launched on January 26, 1942, coinciding with the Republic Day celebrations.
2.  The Indian National Congress adopted the resolution of "Purna Swaraj" (complete independence) at the Lahore Session in 1929.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Quit India Movement was launched on August 9, 1942, not January 26th.  January 26th holds significance as it was declared as Independence Day in 1930 and later became Republic Day in 1950, but it was not the launch date for the Quit India Movement. The Quit India Movement was a pivotal moment in the struggle for independence, characterized by widespread civil disobedience and mass participation. Statement 2 is correct. The Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress in 1929 marked a significant turning point, with the adoption of the "Purna Swaraj" resolution, formally declaring the goal of complete independence from British rule. This resolution represented a shift from earlier demands for dominion status and marked the beginning of a more assertive phase in the independence struggle.  The other options are incorrect because only statement 2 accurately reflects a key event in the timeline of the Indian independence movement.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the system of dyarchy established by the Government of India Act, 1919.
2.  The Act successfully established an All-India Federation, incorporating both British Indian provinces and princely states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act, 1935, significantly altered the political landscape by introducing provincial autonomy.  This replaced the earlier dyarchy system, which shared power between elected Indian ministers and British officials.  Provincial autonomy granted greater self-governance to the provinces, although the Governor still retained significant powers. Statement 2 is incorrect. A key feature of the 1935 Act was its proposal for an All-India Federation, which would have integrated British Indian provinces and princely states. However, this federation never materialized due to the failure to meet the conditions set for the princely states' participation. The non-formation of the federation highlighted the complexities of integrating diverse political entities within India and the limitations of the Act in achieving complete political unity. The other options are incorrect as only statement 1 correctly reflects a key provision of the 1935 Act that was successfully implemented.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the role of the Indian National Congress:**

1.  The Congress consistently opposed the partition of India, advocating for a unified and independent nation.
2. The Congress initially adopted a policy of non-cooperation with the British government, later shifting to participation in elections and holding office in provincial governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indian National Congress's evolution and strategy during the independence movement. Statement 1 is largely true. While the Congress's response to partition was complex and involved internal debates, its overall stance was one of opposition to the division of India.  Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi actively worked towards preventing partition, and the Congress's acceptance of partition was primarily a pragmatic response to the impending reality of the situation. Statement 2 is also correct. The Congress initially adopted a policy of non-cooperation in protest against British policies.  However, this strategy evolved, leading to participation in elections and the acceptance of office in provincial governments under the 1935 Act. This shift reflected internal debates and strategic considerations within the Congress, balancing mass movements with participation in the existing political system. The other options are incorrect because both statements correctly describe significant aspects of the Congress's political journey.


**5. With reference to the first general elections in independent India, consider the following statements:**

1. The elections were held on the basis of universal adult suffrage, with all citizens above the age of 18 being eligible to vote.
2. The Indian National Congress secured a clear majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, forming the first government under Jawaharlal Nehru's leadership.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first general elections in India were based on universal adult suffrage, but the voting age was 21, not 18. The lowering of the voting age to 18 came later.  Universal adult franchise was a landmark achievement, expanding political participation to a vast electorate.  Statement 2 is correct. The Indian National Congress won a resounding victory in the first general elections, securing a substantial majority of seats in the Lok Sabha. This led to the formation of the first government of independent India, with Jawaharlal Nehru as the Prime Minister. The Congress's dominance in the elections reflected its widespread support and its role as a major force in the independence movement. The other options are incorrect because only statement 2 correctly describes a key outcome of the first general elections.


**6.  With reference to the challenges faced by independent India, consider the following statements:**

1. The integration of princely states into the Indian Union was a significant challenge, requiring diplomatic negotiations and, in some cases, military intervention.
2. The rehabilitation of refugees displaced by the partition of India was a smooth and efficiently managed process, with adequate resources allocated for resettlement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The integration of princely states into the Indian Union was a major challenge faced by the newly independent nation.  This involved complex negotiations with the rulers of these states, balancing their autonomy with the need for national unity.  In some cases, like Hyderabad, military intervention was necessary to ensure integration.  The integration of princely states was a crucial step in consolidating India's territorial integrity. Statement 2 is incorrect. The rehabilitation of refugees displaced by the partition of India was a massive and deeply challenging undertaking. The scale of displacement, coupled with widespread communal violence, created a humanitarian crisis.  While the government made significant efforts, resources were often inadequate, and the resettlement process was far from smooth, marked by inequalities and hardships faced by many refugees. The other options are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects a significant challenge faced by independent India.


**7. With reference to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1. Nathuram Godse, the assassin, primarily acted out of anger over Gandhi's perceived pro-Muslim stance and his efforts to mitigate the consequences of partition.
2. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was directly implicated in the assassination and was permanently banned by the government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, explicitly stated his motives in his trial, highlighting his opposition to Gandhi's perceived pro-Muslim bias and his belief that Gandhi's actions were detrimental to Hindu interests.  This reveals the complex interplay of communal tensions and political ideologies that led to the assassination. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RSS was banned following Gandhi's assassination due to concerns about its role in fostering right-wing extremism and communal violence, the ban was not permanent.  The ban was lifted after the RSS accepted certain conditions, including a commitment to renounce violence and loyalty to the Indian Constitution. The other options are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects the primary motive of Mahatma Gandhi's assassin.


**8. With reference to the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the early years of independent India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI initially supported the newly independent Indian government, working within the constitutional framework to achieve its goals.
2.  The CPI's "Telangana Movement," an armed rebellion in Hyderabad, was a major challenge to the newly formed Indian government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CPI initially viewed Indian independence with skepticism, characterizing it as "fake" and criticizing the Congress government as collaborators with imperialist forces. They initially adopted a strategy of armed rebellion rather than working within the existing political system.  Statement 2 is correct. The CPI's Telangana Movement, an armed insurrection in the Hyderabad region, posed a significant challenge to the newly established Indian government. This movement reflected the CPI's belief in the need for a revolutionary overthrow of the existing order and highlighted the early challenges faced by the Indian government in consolidating its authority. The other options are incorrect because only statement 2 accurately describes the CPI's actions in the early years of independent India.


**9. With reference to R.C. Dutt's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. R.C. Dutt's writings significantly contributed to the development of Bengali literature.
2.  He is best known for his articulation of the "Drain of Wealth" theory, which profoundly influenced Indian nationalist thought.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Romesh Chunder Dutt was a multi-faceted personality whose contributions extended beyond economics.  Statement 1 is correct;  R.C. Dutt's literary works contributed significantly to Bengali literature, showcasing his skill as a writer and his engagement with broader cultural issues.  Statement 2 is also correct; while he did not originate the concept, Dutt's detailed economic analyses and writings powerfully articulated the "Drain of Wealth" theory, providing compelling evidence of British economic exploitation. His work played a crucial role in shaping nationalist discourse and mobilizing support for self-rule.  The other options are incorrect because both statements accurately capture important facets of R.C. Dutt's legacy.


**10. With reference to the Nehru-Liaquat Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The pact was signed in 1950 to address the refugee problem and promote communal harmony between India and Pakistan, particularly in Bengal.
2.  The pact led to the immediate and complete resolution of the refugee crisis and the establishment of lasting communal peace in the region.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nehru-Liaquat Pact, signed in 1950, aimed to address the significant refugee crisis and restore communal harmony between India and Pakistan, specifically focusing on Bengal, which was severely affected by the partition. The pact included provisions for the protection of minorities and mechanisms for resolving disputes.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Nehru-Liaquat Pact represented an attempt to address the refugee crisis and promote communal peace, it did not lead to an immediate or complete resolution of these complex problems.  The refugee issue remained a significant challenge for both countries, and communal tensions persisted despite the pact's efforts.  The other options are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects the pact's objectives and context.

**1. With reference to the Rajputana region during the early modern period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chauhans, a prominent Rajput dynasty, consolidated their power in Rajputana after significantly weakening the Pratihara Empire.
2.  The prevalence of dowry, a significant social custom, contributed to the economic vulnerabilities of many Rajput families.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Chauhans were a powerful Rajput clan that rose to prominence in Rajputana following the decline of the Pratihara Empire.  Their rise marked a significant shift in the political landscape of the region. While the Pratihara Empire's weakening paved the way for their ascendancy, it's important to note that the Chauhans' success was also due to their own military prowess and strategic alliances.  Other Rajput clans also benefited from the Pratihara decline, leading to a fragmented but powerful Rajput presence.

Statement 2 is also correct. Dowry systems were indeed prevalent in Rajput society during the early modern period.  These systems often placed significant economic burdens on the families of brides, sometimes leading to debt and financial hardship.  While the exact nature and extent of dowry practices varied across different Rajput clans and regions, its existence as a significant social custom is well-documented. The dowry system is often linked to the patriarchal structure of Rajput society and the importance placed on maintaining family status and alliances.


**2. With reference to the impact of the British East India Company on Rajputana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The East India Company's primary aim in establishing subsidiary alliances with Rajput states was to secure direct military support against external threats, such as the Marathas and Pindaris.
2.  The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 had a limited impact on Rajputana, with relatively little active participation from the region's princely states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the East India Company had multiple objectives in forging subsidiary alliances, securing military support was paramount.  The Company sought to neutralize potential threats from powerful regional powers and prevent the resurgence of any unified opposition to their growing dominance. The alliances ensured a readily available military force at a relatively low cost to the Company, composed of troops from the allied Rajput states. Although the Company also benefited financially and politically, the immediate strategic goal was a strong military foothold.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 did spread to Rajputana, although the level of participation varied across different princely states. While some states remained largely loyal to the British, others witnessed significant rebellions and uprisings. The impact of the mutiny in Rajputana was not negligible; it demonstrated the vulnerabilities of the British power even in regions where they had established strong alliances.  The response of Rajput rulers reflected a complex mix of loyalty, self-interest, and local dynamics.


**3. With reference to the British presence in Rajputana, consider the following statements:**

1.  David Ochterlony played a crucial role in negotiating subsidiary alliances with several Rajput states between 1817 and 1818.
2.  Arthur Wellesley's military victories against Napoleon in Europe directly influenced his later strategies and successes in consolidating British power in Rajputana.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. David Ochterlony was a key figure in the British expansion into Rajputana. His diplomatic skills and military prowess were instrumental in securing subsidiary alliances with several Rajput states during the period mentioned.  His successes helped consolidate British influence in the region and prevent the emergence of a unified Rajput opposition.  His actions reflect the Company's strategy of using a combination of diplomacy and military strength to achieve its objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect, while Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington) was a highly influential figure in the British Empire, his European campaigns and his successes in India are not directly linked in terms of strategy. While his military experience undoubtedly shaped his approach, the context and challenges of warfare in India were significantly different from those in Europe.  The consolidation of British power in Rajputana involved a complex interplay of political maneuvering, economic control, and military strategy, not solely a direct application of his European experiences.


**4. With reference to the social and political landscape of Rajputana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate lost significant provinces in Rajputana due to continuous resistance from Rajput rulers and the relative strength of Rajput kingdoms.
2.  The Ghaznavid raids had a minimal impact on the long-term political structure and social dynamics of Rajputana.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajput kingdoms of Rajputana posed a significant challenge to the Delhi Sultanate.  While the Sultanate did manage to conquer certain Rajput territories, it faced persistent resistance that prevented complete subjugation.  The strength and resilience of various Rajput clans, their strategic alliances, and their ability to wage effective warfare contributed to the Sultanate's failure to fully control the region. This long-term resistance significantly shaped the political geography of Rajputana.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ghaznavid raids, though sporadic, had a considerable impact on Rajputana's political and social landscape. These raids caused widespread destruction, loss of life, and the disruption of established social and economic structures. While Rajputana was not permanently conquered by the Ghaznavids, the raids left a lasting impression and contributed to the region's political instability and the strengthening of defensive measures by Rajput rulers.  The raids are a significant event in the early history of the region.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the role of the East India Company in India:**

1. The East India Company's expansion into India was primarily driven by its desire to monopolize the tea trade with China.
2. The Company's implementation of the Subsidiary Alliance system led to the disbandment of many princely state armies, creating widespread unemployment.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the tea trade was undoubtedly a significant source of profit for the East India Company, it wasn't the *primary* driver of its expansion into India. The Company's ambitions were far broader, encompassing control over trade routes, resources, and political power across the subcontinent.  The desire for territorial control and political influence was a more significant factor in the Company's expansion than any single commodity.

Statement 2 is correct. A key consequence of the Subsidiary Alliance system was the disbandment of numerous princely state armies.  These armies were replaced by British-controlled forces, resulting in widespread unemployment among soldiers and officers. This unemployment created social and economic instability, and contributed to widespread discontent, fueling resentment against the British.  This economic impact was a key factor in the build-up to the 1857 revolt.


**6.  With reference to the early nationalist movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early nationalists primarily focused on constitutional agitation and gradual political progress, largely eschewing more radical methods of protest.
2.  The Ilbert Bill controversy demonstrated the early nationalists' commitment to achieving complete independence from British rule.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement, often referred to as the "Moderate" phase, was characterized by a focus on constitutional methods of protest.  Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and others believed in working within the existing political framework to achieve gradual reforms.  Their methods included petitions, public meetings, and appeals to the British government and public opinion.  They believed that gradual pressure would lead to meaningful change.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ilbert Bill controversy, while highlighting the issue of racial discrimination within the Indian judicial system, did not directly represent a demand for complete independence.  The early nationalists' primary focus was on achieving administrative reforms and greater Indian participation in the governance of the country, not outright separation from British rule. While the Ilbert Bill controversy did expose the discriminatory nature of British rule, it did not lead to a widespread call for independence at that stage.  The demand for self-rule developed later.


**7. With reference to the social reform movements in 19th-century India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jotiba Phule's work was primarily focused on improving the social and economic conditions of Brahmins in Maharashtra.
2.  The Widow Remarriage Association, founded in the 1850s, played a significant role in challenging traditional societal norms.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jotiba Phule's social reform work was focused on the upliftment of marginalized communities, particularly the lower castes (non-Brahmins) and untouchables in Maharashtra. He actively challenged the Brahmanical dominance and advocated for social justice and equality. His work directly contradicted the idea of focusing on the Brahmin community.

Statement 2 is correct. The Widow Remarriage Association, active from the 1850s, played a crucial role in challenging the deeply ingrained social stigma associated with widow remarriage.  This movement faced significant opposition from conservative sections of society but succeeded in gradually changing attitudes and legal frameworks.  The work of reformers like Vishnu Shastri Pundit and Karsondas Mulji highlights the significant efforts made to challenge traditional norms.  The movement's success demonstrated the growing influence of reformist ideas in the 19th century.


**8.  With reference to the causes of the 1857 Revolt, consider the following statements:**

1.  The annexation of Awadh was a significant factor in triggering the revolt, particularly among sepoys who hailed from that region.
2.  The British policy of disarming the Indian population played a minor role in fueling the widespread discontent leading to the revolt.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie in 1856 was a deeply resented act, particularly among the sepoys of the East India Company's army, many of whom originated from Awadh. The annexation not only eroded their regional loyalties and sense of belonging but also resulted in economic hardship through increased taxation and the disruption of traditional social structures.  This act directly contributed to the simmering discontent that erupted into the 1857 revolt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The British policy of systematically disarming the Indian population was a significant factor in contributing to the widespread discontent that led to the 1857 revolt.  The disarming of the populace left the Indian people vulnerable and weakened their ability to resist British authority. This policy, coupled with other grievances, fuelled the sense of insecurity and resentment among Indians and contributed to the widespread participation in the revolt.  It was a major factor in the British ability to eventually suppress the revolt.


**9. Consider the following statements related to the East India Company's economic policies:**

1. The East India Company's land revenue policies, such as the Permanent Settlement, led to the enrichment of many traditional zamindars and improved the condition of the peasantry.
2. The Company's introduction of new cash crops, like indigo, had a positive impact on Indian agriculture and rural economy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The East India Company's land revenue policies, while varying across regions, did not uniformly lead to the enrichment of traditional zamindars or improved the condition of the peasantry. The Permanent Settlement, for instance, while benefiting some zamindars, also led to the exploitation of the peasantry through high taxes and the loss of land rights.  Other revenue systems implemented by the Company also had negative consequences for the rural population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The introduction of cash crops like indigo, while generating revenue for the Company, had a predominantly negative impact on Indian agriculture and the rural economy.  The cultivation of indigo often led to the displacement of food crops, resulting in famines and economic hardship for the peasantry.  The system of forced cultivation and unfair pricing further exacerbated the negative impact on the rural population.  The Company's focus on cash crops for export further crippled the traditional Indian agricultural system.


**10. With reference to the growth of communalism in India during the pre-independence era, consider the following statements:**

1. The Muslim League's demand for Pakistan was primarily based on the scientific and historical evidence of the two-nation theory.
2. The Hindu Mahasabha's ideology played a significant role in escalating communal tensions and fueling the demand for partition.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Muslim League's demand for Pakistan was not based on scientific or historical evidence. The "two-nation theory," which posited that Hindus and Muslims were two distinct nations, lacked historical and sociological basis.  It was a political construct used to mobilize support for the League's objectives.  The theory ignored the centuries of intertwined social, cultural, and political interactions between Hindus and Muslims in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu nationalist organization, played a significant role in escalating communal tensions.  Its ideology, which emphasized Hindu identity and interests, often clashed with the Muslim League's vision.  The Mahasabha's actions and rhetoric contributed to the polarization of Hindu and Muslim communities and fueled the demand for partition.  The reciprocal actions of both organizations contributed significantly to the atmosphere of conflict in the pre-independence era.

**1. With reference to Gandhi's socio-political philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi's concept of Satyagraha, while rooted in Indian traditions, also drew inspiration from the philosophy of Leo Tolstoy and Henry David Thoreau.
2. Gandhi unequivocally supported the Varna system as a natural and essential element of Hindu society, advocating for its preservation and strengthening.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gandhi's Satyagraha philosophy, a method of non-violent resistance, was significantly influenced by thinkers like Leo Tolstoy and Henry David Thoreau.  Tolstoy's emphasis on non-violent resistance to evil resonated deeply with Gandhi's own beliefs, shaping his approach to social and political action.  Similarly, Thoreau's concept of civil disobedience, as articulated in his essay "Civil Disobedience," provided a framework for Gandhi's own strategies of non-cooperation and defiance of unjust laws.  The combination of these influences, along with his understanding of Indian philosophical and religious traditions, formed the core of Satyagraha.  This eclectic approach reflects Gandhi's ability to synthesize diverse intellectual currents to create a unique and effective method of resistance.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Gandhi was a devout Hindu and deeply engaged with Hindu traditions, his stance on the Varna system was complex and nuanced.  He strongly opposed the practice of untouchability, viewing it as a grave injustice and a perversion of the original intent of the Varna system. He actively campaigned for the upliftment of the Dalits (formerly known as "untouchables"), challenging the rigid social hierarchy and advocating for their integration into mainstream Hindu society.  He did not endorse the Varna system in its rigid, discriminatory form but rather sought to reform it, emphasizing its potential for social harmony if interpreted in a way that valued equality and dignity for all. His vision was one of a casteless society, ultimately rejecting the inherent inequalities associated with the traditional interpretation of the Varna system.


**2. With reference to Gandhi's involvement in major movements, consider the following statements:**

1. The Champaran Satyagraha, Gandhi's first major campaign in India, primarily focused on the grievances of indigo planters against oppressive land revenue policies.
2. The Khilafat Movement, though initially supported by Gandhi, witnessed a significant decline in his involvement due to escalating communal violence between Hindus and Muslims.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Champaran Satyagraha, launched in 1917, focused on the plight of the peasant farmers, not indigo planters.  The farmers were forced by British planters to cultivate indigo on a significant portion of their land under exploitative conditions. Gandhi's intervention led to the abolition of the oppressive "tinkathia" system and secured some relief for the peasants. The focus was on the injustices faced by the agrarian population, highlighting the economic exploitation prevalent in the colonial system.


Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi initially supported the Khilafat Movement, a pan-Islamic movement advocating for the protection of the Ottoman Caliphate.  He saw an opportunity to unite Hindus and Muslims in a common cause against British imperialism. However, his support waned due to increasing communal tensions and violence between the two communities.  The escalating violence and the inability to maintain inter-religious harmony led to Gandhi's withdrawal of support from the movement, reflecting the challenges of forging a unified national movement amidst religious divisions.  This highlights the complexities faced by Gandhi in navigating religious differences within the broader national struggle for independence.


**3. With reference to Gandhi's economic philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi advocated for complete mechanization of Indian industries to enhance productivity and compete in the global market.
2. Gandhi's vision for India's economy emphasized decentralized village industries and the promotion of Khadi (hand-spun cloth) as a symbol of self-reliance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Gandhi was a staunch critic of large-scale industrialization and the associated mechanization, particularly in the context of its potential to displace workers and exacerbate economic inequalities.  He believed that mass production and industrialization, as practiced in the West, led to dehumanization and environmental damage. His vision for India's economy was rooted in the philosophy of Swaraj (self-rule), which extended beyond political independence to encompass economic self-sufficiency and social justice. This included a focus on rural development and the promotion of village industries.


Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi's economic philosophy emphasized the importance of decentralized village industries, believing that they offered a more sustainable and equitable path to economic development.  He promoted Khadi, hand-spun and hand-woven cloth, not only as a source of employment for rural communities but also as a powerful symbol of Indian self-reliance and resistance to colonial economic policies.  The spinning wheel became a prominent symbol of his movement, representing his vision for a self-sufficient and ethically sound economic system.  This emphasis on decentralized production and traditional crafts contrasted sharply with the prevailing capitalist model, reflecting his commitment to social justice and environmental sustainability.


**4. With reference to Gandhi's relationship with other prominent figures, consider the following statements:**

1. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru shared an unwavering agreement on all aspects of political strategy and ideology throughout their collaboration in the Indian National Congress.
2.  Gandhi's relationship with B.R. Ambedkar was characterized by significant ideological differences, particularly regarding the approach to the caste system and the issue of separate electorates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhi and Nehru were important collaborators in the Indian National Congress and shared the common goal of Indian independence, their political strategies and ideologies diverged on several crucial issues. Nehru, influenced by socialist and modernist ideas, advocated for a more centralized and industrial model of development, whereas Gandhi favored a decentralized, village-based approach.  Their differences extended to the pace and methods of the freedom struggle, with Nehru sometimes advocating for more assertive and direct action.  This highlights the internal diversity of opinion within the nationalist movement and the challenges of maintaining unity despite ideological differences.


Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, though both dedicated to social reform and the eradication of untouchability, held significantly different viewpoints on the approach to the caste system.  Ambedkar, a Dalit leader, advocated for a more radical and assertive approach, including the demand for separate electorates for Dalits, believing that it was necessary to secure their political representation and protect their interests.  Gandhi, while vehemently opposing untouchability, believed that separate electorates would further exacerbate communal divisions.  Their differing perspectives and approaches to the issue of caste and representation resulted in intense debates and disagreements, reflecting the complex dynamics of social reform within the nationalist movement.  Their relationship, although marked by periods of negotiation and compromise, was ultimately characterized by substantial ideological differences.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Gandhi's strategies and methods:**

1.  Gandhi's advocacy for non-violent resistance, or Satyagraha, was primarily directed towards achieving political independence from the British and did not extend to addressing social issues.
2.  The Dandi March, a pivotal event in the Indian independence movement, involved a symbolic act of defiance against the British salt tax, demonstrating the power of non-violent civil disobedience.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha, while aimed at achieving political independence, was fundamentally a moral and ethical framework that extended to all aspects of life, including social reform.  He believed that true Swaraj (self-rule) encompassed not only political freedom but also social and economic justice.  His campaigns against untouchability, his advocacy for women's rights, and his emphasis on the dignity of labor all demonstrate the wide application of Satyagraha beyond the purely political realm.  The interconnectedness of political and social liberation was central to Gandhi's approach.


Statement 2 is correct. The Dandi March, undertaken in 1930, was a landmark event in the Indian independence movement.  Gandhi and his followers marched to the coastal town of Dandi to make salt, defying the British government's monopoly on salt production and its high taxation on it.  This act of civil disobedience, symbolic of the larger struggle against British rule, mobilized widespread support across India and brought international attention to the movement. The Dandi March exemplifies the effectiveness of Gandhi's Satyagraha strategy in harnessing mass participation for non-violent resistance.  It demonstrated that even seemingly small acts of defiance, when undertaken with mass participation and moral conviction, could challenge the authority of a powerful empire.

**1. With reference to the activities of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress initially focused on constitutional methods, advocating for gradual reforms within the existing legal framework.
2.  The Congress consistently maintained a unified stance on all political and social issues, avoiding internal factions or disagreements.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early years of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905) were characterized by a predominantly moderate approach.  Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and others primarily employed constitutional means, such as petitions, memoranda, and public appeals, to pressure the British government for reforms.  Their strategy focused on gradual, incremental change within the existing political system, believing that sustained pressure and reasoned argument could achieve their goals.  This approach contrasted sharply with the more radical, assertive tactics that would emerge later in the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Congress, from its inception, experienced internal divisions and disagreements on strategy and goals.  The most significant split was the Surat Split of 1907, which divided the Congress into moderate and extremist factions.  These factions differed significantly on the methods of achieving self-rule, with extremists advocating for more assertive and potentially confrontational tactics.  Even within the moderate camp, there were varying opinions on the pace and nature of reforms. The Congress's internal dynamics were complex and often characterized by diverse viewpoints and power struggles, rather than monolithic unity.  Therefore, the assertion of consistent unified stance is inaccurate.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Rowlatt Act:**

1.  The Rowlatt Act was enacted in response to widespread public support for the Gandhian non-cooperation movement.
2. The Act significantly curtailed civil liberties and allowed for detention without trial, leading to widespread protests and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919, *before* the Non-Cooperation Movement gained significant momentum.  It was enacted by the Imperial Legislative Council in response to the British government's concerns about revolutionary activities and unrest following World War I. The Act aimed to suppress dissent and was intended as a preventative measure against future uprisings, not as a reaction to the Non-Cooperation Movement which began later in 1920.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rowlatt Act's most controversial aspect was its provisions allowing for the detention of individuals without trial and the suppression of political activities.  These provisions represented a severe curtailment of fundamental rights and led to widespread protests and civil disobedience. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, where British troops fired upon a peaceful gathering, was a direct consequence of the public outrage and resistance generated by the Act.  This event dramatically escalated tensions and became a turning point in the Indian independence movement.


**3. With reference to the activities of Dadabhai Naoroji, consider the following statements:**

1.  Naoroji's "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India" primarily focused on the social injustices prevalent in Indian society.
2.  Naoroji was a prominent member of the Indian National Congress and served as its president on multiple occasions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Dadabhai Naoroji was concerned about social issues, his seminal work, "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India," primarily focused on the economic exploitation of India under British rule.  He meticulously documented the "drain of wealth" from India to Britain, arguing that British policies systematically impoverished the Indian population. His analysis highlighted the economic aspects of colonial rule, rather than focusing primarily on social injustices, although the two were clearly linked in his analysis.

Statement 2 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji was a founding member of the Indian National Congress and played a crucial role in shaping its early direction. His contributions extended beyond mere membership; he served as the President of the Indian National Congress on three occasions (1886, 1893, and 1906), demonstrating his significant leadership within the organization.  His prominence within the Congress underscores his commitment to Indian self-rule and his influential role in the early nationalist movement.


**4. With reference to the impact of Lord Curzon's policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Curzon's approach to Indian administration was characterized by a strong emphasis on decentralization and empowering local governance.
2.  Curzon's policies significantly improved the economic conditions of the Indian peasantry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lord Curzon's administrative policies were characterized by a strong centralizing tendency. He believed in strengthening the power of the Viceroy and the central government, rather than decentralizing authority.  His policies often involved increased official control and a reduction in the autonomy of provincial governments. This contrasted with the later reforms which sought to devolve more power to the provinces.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Curzon implemented various administrative reforms, his policies did not significantly improve the economic conditions of the Indian peasantry.  In fact, some of his policies, such as those related to land revenue and taxation, arguably worsened the economic situation of many peasants.  His focus was largely on administrative efficiency and strengthening British control, rather than on addressing the socio-economic problems faced by the rural population.  The lack of attention to agrarian issues led to continued peasant hardship.


**5. Consider the following statements about the  Non-Cooperation Movement:**

1.  The Non-Cooperation Movement was launched primarily in response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.
2.  C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were prominent leaders who played a significant role in shaping the movement's strategy.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the seeds of discontent against British rule were sown long before, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre served as a major catalyst for the launch of the Non-Cooperation Movement. The horrific event galvanized public opinion against the British Raj, creating a climate conducive to widespread non-cooperation and civil disobedience.  The outrage triggered by the massacre fuelled the movement's initial momentum, and it became a central grievance driving participation.

Statement 2 is correct. C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru were indeed prominent leaders of the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Although Mahatma Gandhi was the central figure, Das and Nehru played crucial roles in organizing and strategizing the movement within various regions.  Their involvement highlights the broader participation of nationalist leaders in the movement beyond Gandhi's immediate circle.  Their contributions to the movement were substantial, both in terms of mobilizing support and shaping its overall trajectory.


**6. With reference to the Muslim League, consider the following statements:**

1. The Muslim League initially advocated for the creation of a separate Muslim state (Pakistan) as its primary political goal.
2.  The Lucknow Pact of 1916 marked a significant period of cooperation between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The demand for Pakistan, as the creation of a separate Muslim state, did not emerge as the Muslim League's primary goal from its inception.  Initially, the League primarily aimed to secure the political and religious rights of Indian Muslims within a unified India. The demand for Pakistan solidified later, particularly under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, as a result of escalating communal tensions and perceived failures of Congress to adequately address Muslim concerns.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lucknow Pact of 1916 represented a significant milestone in Hindu-Muslim unity and cooperation.  This agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League demonstrated a period of shared political goals and strategies, and it facilitated joint action against British rule.  The pact showcased a time of relative harmony and collaboration between the two major political organizations before the later divergence in their objectives.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Government of India Act of 1935:**

1. The Act introduced a system of provincial autonomy, granting significant legislative powers to provincial governments.
2.  The Act fully satisfied the demands of the Indian National Congress for complete independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 was a landmark piece of legislation that introduced a significant degree of provincial autonomy in India.  It established a federal structure with both a federal and provincial legislatures, granting substantial law-making powers to the provinces.  This was a major step towards self-government, although it did not grant complete independence.  The system of dyarchy, or divided governance, was replaced with a system offering greater provincial autonomy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did not grant complete independence to India.  It was a step towards self-governance but fell far short of the Congress's demand for *purna swaraj* (complete independence). The Act retained significant British control over key areas of governance and did not address the fundamental issue of colonial sovereignty. The Congress actively opposed the Act, viewing it as insufficient to address its main objective of complete self-rule for India.


**8. With reference to the Salt Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Salt Satyagraha was solely a Gandhian initiative, with minimal participation from other nationalist leaders.
2.  The Salt Satyagraha directly challenged the British government's monopoly on salt production and distribution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi was the central figure in organizing and leading the Salt Satyagraha, it was not a solely Gandhian initiative.  Numerous other nationalist leaders and activists from across India participated in the movement.  The Salt Satyagraha involved mass mobilization and widespread participation, demonstrating the movement's broad-based support.  It was a collaborative effort, not a singular act of Gandhi.

Statement 2 is correct. The Salt Satyagraha was a direct challenge to the British government's salt tax and its monopoly on salt production and distribution.  This tax was deeply resented by the Indian population, and Gandhi's decision to break the salt law symbolized a powerful act of defiance against colonial authority and economic exploitation. The act of making salt, a basic necessity, became a symbol of resistance against unfair taxation and oppressive colonial rule.  The Salt Satyagraha's success demonstrated the power of mass civil disobedience in challenging unjust laws.


**9. Consider the following statements about the partition of India:**

1. The partition was primarily a result of the failure of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on power-sharing after independence.
2.  The partition was fully supported by all sections of Indian society, including both Hindu and Muslim communities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The partition of India was a direct consequence of the failure of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League to agree on a power-sharing arrangement after independence.  The escalating communal tensions, mistrust, and political maneuvering between the two organizations created an environment where partition appeared to be the only viable solution, though a deeply regrettable one.  The inability to find common ground on constitutional issues and the distribution of power ultimately resulted in the division of the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The partition of India was not universally supported.  While some sections of both Hindu and Muslim communities supported it, others strongly opposed the division.  The partition led to widespread violence, displacement, and communal strife, highlighting the deep divisions it created within Indian society.  The partition's legacy continues to be marked by the immense human suffering and displacement it caused.  Therefore, the assertion of unanimous support is completely false.


**10. With reference to the activities of Lala Lajpat Rai, consider the following statements:**

1. Lala Lajpat Rai served as the President of the Indian National Congress on several occasions.
2. Lala Lajpat Rai was a staunch advocate for the complete independence of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Lala Lajpat Rai was a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress and played a significant role in the nationalist movement, he never served as its president. He was a key figure in the movement, but the presidency was held by other prominent figures.  This fact is easily overlooked, given his significant contribution to the independence movement.

Statement 2 is correct.  Lala Lajpat Rai was a strong proponent of complete independence for India. He was a vocal critic of British rule and advocated for a more assertive and radical approach to achieving self-rule.  His views reflected the growing sentiment within the nationalist movement for complete independence, moving away from the earlier moderate calls for gradual reforms.  His unwavering commitment to Indian independence is a defining aspect of his political legacy.

**1. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement primarily focused on boycotting British goods and promoting indigenous industries,  with a significant emphasis on the boycott of Manchester cloth and Liverpool salt.
2.  While led by Extremists, the Swadeshi Movement also involved participation from Moderates, who advocated for a more gradual and constitutional approach to achieving self-governance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely accurate. The Swadeshi Movement was a crucial phase in Indian nationalism characterized by a widespread boycott of British goods, especially textiles and salt, to bolster the Indian economy and weaken British control. The economic aspect, symbolized by the boycott of Manchester cloth and Liverpool salt, was central to its strategy.  The movement aimed to promote indigenous industries and revive traditional crafts, fostering self-reliance and economic nationalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Swadeshi Movement did have a diverse range of participants, it's inaccurate to say Moderates actively *involved* themselves in the movement's core activities.  The movement was primarily spearheaded by Extremists like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai, who advocated for more assertive and swifter methods of achieving self-rule, often clashing with the more moderate approach favored by Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Dadabhai Naoroji. Moderates, while not directly participating in the boycotts and agitations, held differing views on the pace and methods of achieving independence.  Their presence was more one of passive observation or mild dissent, rather than active participation in the core tenets of the Swadeshi Movement.  The significant ideological divide between the Extremists and Moderates within the Indian National Congress during this period is a key aspect often examined in the UPSC.


**2. With reference to the Khilafat Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's primary goal was to secure the Caliphate for the Ottoman Sultan, aligning with the pan-Islamic sentiments of the time.  Its success was closely tied to the fate of Turkey.
2.  The movement's collaboration with the Non-Cooperation Movement significantly broadened its reach and impact, fostering a period of unprecedented Hindu-Muslim unity, though ultimately short-lived.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a core objective of the Khilafat Movement.  The movement arose from deep concern among Indian Muslims about the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate, the symbolic head of the Islamic world, following World War I.  Indian Muslims felt a strong sense of pan-Islamic solidarity and viewed the potential dismantling of the Ottoman Empire as a direct threat to their religious identity and sentiments. The movement's success, or failure, was intrinsically linked to the political future of Turkey and the survival of the Caliphate.

Statement 2 also holds true. The Khilafat Movement's strategic alliance with Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement was a defining moment in the history of Indian nationalism. This collaboration brought together Hindus and Muslims in a united front against British rule, fostering a period of remarkable communal harmony.  However, this unity was fragile and eventually fractured due to various factors, including the inherent differences in the goals and priorities of the two movements, and the subsequent intensification of communal tensions.  The temporary nature of this Hindu-Muslim unity is a crucial point for understanding the complexities of the Indian independence movement and a frequently tested area in the UPSC.



**3. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement, launched on August 9th, 1942, witnessed widespread participation from various segments of Indian society, including nationalists, Satyagrahis, workers, and students,  but notably excluded significant participation from Muslim League.
2.  While Gandhiji was the central figure, the Quit India Movement also saw significant leadership from other prominent figures such as Jayaprakash Narayan and Aruna Asaf Ali, who played crucial roles in organizing and leading various aspects of the movement.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the broad participation in the Quit India Movement.  Launched on August 9th, 1942, the movement saw a massive upsurge of popular participation across various social strata.  However, the movement's impact was significantly limited by the Muslim League's decision to remain largely aloof, reflecting the growing communal divide within Indian society at that time. The lack of widespread Muslim League participation is a key factor that differentiates the Quit India Movement from earlier movements like the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. Although Mahatma Gandhi was the inspirational leader of the Quit India Movement, its success depended on the dedication and leadership of numerous other prominent figures.  Jayaprakash Narayan, for example, played a crucial role in organizing underground activities, while Aruna Asaf Ali's bold defiance and leadership in the movement's early days were highly influential. The movement's decentralized and largely spontaneous nature meant that leadership emerged from various regional and social groups, making it a complex and multifaceted historical event.  The UPSC frequently tests the understanding of the diverse leadership and organizational structures within the Quit India Movement.



**4. With reference to Raja Rammohan Roy's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Roy's advocacy for social reforms, including his relentless campaign against Sati, was instrumental in its eventual legal abolition in 1829, highlighting his commitment to modernizing Hindu society and promoting women's rights.
2.  While fluent in multiple languages, including Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and English, Roy's most significant literary work, "A Gift to Monotheists," was written in Bengali, demonstrating his commitment to using vernacular languages to reach a wider audience.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Raja Rammohan Roy's pivotal role in the abolition of Sati. His tireless efforts, which included using religious texts to argue against the practice and mobilizing public opinion, significantly contributed to the 1829 government regulation that criminalized Sati.  His work exemplifies his commitment to social reform, particularly the advancement of women's rights within Hindu society, a key aspect of the Indian Renaissance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although Raja Rammohan Roy was indeed a polyglot proficient in numerous languages, including Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and English,  "A Gift to Monotheists" was originally written in Persian, not Bengali.  While he did champion the use of vernacular languages for wider dissemination of his ideas and translated several works into Bengali, his initial work, "A Gift to Monotheists," was penned in Persian to reach a broader intellectual audience familiar with that language.  The UPSC often tests the details of the lives and works of prominent historical figures, making precise factual recall important.


**5. With reference to Lord Dalhousie's tenure as Governor-General, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dalhousie's implementation of the Doctrine of Lapse led to the annexation of several Indian states, significantly expanding British territory but also fueling widespread resentment and contributing to the growing unrest that culminated in the 1857 Revolt.
2.  While known for his annexationist policies, Dalhousie also initiated several infrastructural developments, including improvements to communication and transportation networks, which facilitated British administration and economic exploitation of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the impact of Dalhousie's annexationist policies. His aggressive implementation of the Doctrine of Lapse, a policy that annexed states without a direct male heir, resulted in the annexation of several princely states, dramatically increasing British control over India.  However, this policy significantly exacerbated resentment and mistrust among Indian rulers and the populace, contributing to the simmering discontent that eventually erupted into the 1857 Revolt.  The Doctrine of Lapse is a crucial aspect of British colonial history and is frequently examined in the UPSC.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While primarily remembered for his expansionist policies, Dalhousie also oversaw several infrastructural projects aimed at improving communication and transportation within India. These developments, such as the expansion of railway lines and telegraph networks, facilitated British administration, trade, and the overall economic exploitation of the country.  These infrastructural developments, while serving British interests, had lasting impacts on India's development, a duality often explored in UPSC examinations.

**1. With reference to the early Indian National Congress and its leaders, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address to the Indian National Congress, first articulated the "Drain of Wealth" theory, arguing that British policies systematically impoverished India.
2. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent moderate leader, founded the Servants of India Society, an organization dedicated to social reform and political activism, but maintained a distance from direct confrontation with the British Raj.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the early Indian National Congress and the roles of its prominent leaders.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Dadabhai Naoroji's significant contribution to the nationalist movement.  He was a key figure in articulating the "Drain of Wealth" theory, a crucial economic critique of British rule in India, highlighting the systematic transfer of wealth from India to Britain.  He presented this analysis in several of his presidential addresses to the Indian National Congress, significantly shaping the economic arguments within the nationalist discourse. His work profoundly influenced the understanding of British exploitation and fueled the demand for economic reforms.

Statement 2 is also correct in describing Gopal Krishna Gokhale's role and the nature of the Servants of India Society. Gokhale, a prominent moderate leader within the Congress, adopted a strategy of constitutional agitation and peaceful reform.  He believed in working within the existing system to achieve gradual progress.  The Servants of India Society, which he founded, reflected this approach. The organization aimed at training individuals for selfless public service and advocating for social and political reforms through constitutional means, rather than direct confrontation or rebellion against the British government.  Its focus on social reform, education, and gradual political change distinguished it from more radical nationalist groups.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate and significant details about the early Congress and its leading figures.



**2. With reference to the Home Rule Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant independently launched their respective Home Rule Leagues, advocating for self-government within the British Empire, but their movements remained geographically separate, with Tilak's primarily focused on Maharashtra and Besant's on South India.
2. The Home Rule Leagues, while aiming for self-government, significantly contributed to the growth of Indian nationalism by promoting political awareness, organizing mass mobilization, and challenging the legitimacy of British rule through peaceful means.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially inaccurate. While both Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant did launch Home Rule Leagues,  it's not entirely accurate to say their movements were completely geographically separate. While Tilak's efforts were concentrated in Maharashtra, Besant's league had a broader reach across several parts of India, including South India. The assertion of complete geographical separation is an oversimplification of the complex dynamics of the movement.

Statement 2, however, is entirely correct. The Home Rule Leagues played a crucial role in furthering the cause of Indian nationalism.  Both Tilak and Besant's leagues successfully mobilized mass support through their campaigns.  They raised political awareness amongst the Indian population, particularly in areas where nationalist sentiment was not as strong.  Their peaceful methods of agitation, focusing on constitutional means and public awareness campaigns, challenged the authority of the British Raj without resorting to violence. Their success in organizing and mobilizing the masses laid the groundwork for future, more radical phases of the Indian independence movement. The leagues' contribution to the development of a unified nationalist sentiment across diverse regions of India is undeniable.



**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement:**

1.  The Non-Cooperation Movement, initiated by Mahatma Gandhi, initially enjoyed widespread support across various sections of Indian society, including prominent leaders like Motilal Nehru, but its momentum was significantly hampered by the Chauri Chaura incident.
2. The movement's emphasis on swadeshi (promoting Indian goods) and the boycott of British goods, while contributing to the growth of indigenous industries, did not fully translate into widespread economic self-sufficiency.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Non-Cooperation Movement. Statement 1 correctly points out the initial broad-based support the movement received.  Many prominent leaders, including Motilal Nehru, joined Gandhi in advocating for non-cooperation with the British government. However, the Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in casualties, significantly impacted the movement's trajectory. Gandhi, deeply concerned about the escalating violence, decided to suspend the movement, causing disillusionment among some of its supporters and marking a turning point in its momentum.

Statement 2 also holds true.  The Non-Cooperation Movement's emphasis on swadeshi played a role in reviving some Indian industries and fostering a sense of economic self-reliance.  However, it's inaccurate to suggest that it led to widespread economic self-sufficiency. The movement's impact on the economy was significant but limited.  The transition to complete self-sufficiency required more extensive and long-term structural changes than the movement could achieve within its relatively short duration.  The boycott of British goods certainly created some space for Indian products, but it did not completely displace the British economic dominance in India.  The movement was a significant step towards self-reliance but did not achieve complete economic independence.


**4. With reference to the activities of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), consider the following statements:**

1. Bhagat Singh, a prominent member of the HSRA, advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) and incorporated socialist ideals into his revolutionary ideology, but he ultimately rejected the use of violence as a means to achieve political objectives.
2. The HSRA's activities included the assassination of John Saunders, intended as retaliation for the lathi charge on Lala Lajpat Rai, and the throwing of bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly as a form of political protest.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bhagat Singh, a key figure of the HSRA, indeed advocated for Purna Swaraj and integrated socialist principles into his revolutionary philosophy, it's inaccurate to claim he rejected violence.  A core aspect of the HSRA's strategy was the use of targeted violence, including assassinations and bomb attacks, as a means of political protest and to draw attention to their cause.  He believed in revolutionary violence as a tool to achieve their goals.  His writings and actions demonstrate a commitment to revolutionary methods, including violence, to bring about radical social and political change.

Statement 2, however, is accurate. The HSRA undertook several high-profile actions.  The assassination of John Saunders, mistakenly believed to be the police officer responsible for the lathi charge on Lala Lajpat Rai, was a significant event.  This action, while controversial, aimed at highlighting the brutality of British rule and garnering support for the revolutionary cause.  Similarly, the throwing of bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly, although designed to be non-lethal, served as a symbolic protest against oppressive legislation and to publicize the HSRA's ideology and demands.  These actions formed a key part of the HSRA's revolutionary strategy.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**5. With reference to the post-independence challenges faced by India, consider the following statements:**

1. The integration of princely states into the Indian Union was largely a peaceful process, primarily facilitated by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's diplomatic efforts and the willingness of most princely rulers to accede to India.
2. The partition of India resulted in widespread communal violence, particularly in Punjab and Bengal, leading to a massive refugee crisis and the displacement of millions of people, demanding immediate humanitarian intervention and resettlement efforts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification of a complex historical process.  While Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a crucial role in integrating the princely states into the Indian Union, the process was far from entirely peaceful.  Several princely states initially resisted accession, leading to military interventions, negotiations, and political maneuvering.  The integration involved significant challenges and complexities, including varying levels of cooperation from the rulers and the diverse political landscapes within the princely states.  The assertion that it was “largely peaceful” ignores the instances of conflict and coercion involved.

Statement 2, however, accurately describes a major challenge faced by newly independent India. The partition of India resulted in catastrophic communal violence, particularly in Punjab and Bengal.  Millions of people were displaced, leading to a massive refugee crisis that required immediate and large-scale humanitarian efforts. The scale of violence and displacement caused immense human suffering and posed a significant challenge to the newly formed Indian government's capacity to provide relief, rehabilitation, and resettlement for the affected populations. The humanitarian crisis resulting from partition was a severe and immediate consequence that significantly impacted India's early years of independence. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**1. With reference to the Cripps Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps proposals explicitly guaranteed complete independence for India upon the conclusion of World War II, contingent upon the formation of a Constituent Assembly.
2.  The mission's failure stemmed primarily from the Congress's rejection of the proposed Dominion status, deeming it insufficient given the ongoing war and the need for immediate self-governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Cripps Mission did propose a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution for India, it did *not* guarantee complete independence immediately.  The proposal offered Dominion status after the war, a point of contention with the Indian National Congress.  The Cripps proposals were carefully worded to avoid committing to immediate independence, a stance that significantly contributed to their failure. The emphasis was on post-war self-governance, not immediate independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cripps Mission ultimately failed because the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, found the offer of Dominion status inadequate.  They desired complete independence and immediate transfer of power, believing that promises for the future were insufficient given the dire circumstances of the war and the growing threat of Japanese invasion. The Congress felt the Viceroy's continued autocratic powers were unacceptable. The option for provinces to opt out of the proposed Indian Union further fueled the Congress's rejection, as it threatened the unity of India.  This fundamental disagreement over the timing and nature of self-governance led to the breakdown of negotiations.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Quit India Movement:**

1.  The Quit India Resolution, adopted in August 1942, explicitly advocated for a completely non-violent mass struggle, rejecting any form of armed resistance.
2. The movement's widespread nature and spontaneous uprisings resulted in the formation of numerous parallel governments in various regions, effectively challenging British authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Quit India Resolution aimed for a non-violent mass struggle, the movement itself witnessed significant instances of violence, particularly after the arrest of key Congress leaders.  The absence of established leadership and the pent-up frustration of the populace led to spontaneous outbursts and acts of defiance that went beyond non-violent methods.  The government's heavy-handed response further exacerbated the situation, fueling more violent reactions.  Therefore, the claim of a purely non-violent struggle is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The arrest of Gandhi and other prominent Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, left a vacuum of leadership. This led to the emergence of numerous spontaneous and localized uprisings across India.  In several regions, parallel governments were formed, often functioning independently of British authority for a period of time. These parallel administrations, while short-lived, demonstrated the extent of popular discontent and the breakdown of British control in certain areas.  These "parallel governments" provided localized administration and challenged British authority directly.


**3. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA), consider the following statements:**

1. The INA, primarily composed of Indian soldiers who had been captured by the Japanese during World War II, actively collaborated with the Axis powers throughout the conflict.
2.  The trials of INA officers following the war, notably Shah Nawaz Khan, Prem Kumar Sehgal, and Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon, were met with widespread popular support in India, galvanizing the independence movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The INA was initially formed from Indian prisoners of war captured by the Japanese. While the INA's aim was Indian independence, its operational reality involved close collaboration with the Japanese war effort in Southeast Asia.  The INA fought alongside the Japanese army, participating in campaigns against the Allied forces. This association with the Axis powers, while controversial, was a crucial aspect of the INA's existence and its role in the broader context of the Indian independence struggle.  It's important to note that the degree of collaboration varied among INA members.

Statement 2 is also correct. The trials of INA officers like Shah Nawaz Khan, Prem Kumar Sehgal, and Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon after the war became a pivotal moment in the Indian independence movement.  Accused of treason for fighting against the British, these officers were instead hailed as national heroes by the Indian populace.  The trials sparked widespread protests and demonstrations across India, highlighting the growing anti-British sentiment and solidifying support for independence. The trials transformed the accused into symbols of resistance, significantly impacting public opinion and the momentum of the independence movement.


**4. With reference to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The pact resulted in the immediate release of all political prisoners, irrespective of the nature of their offenses, signifying a complete reconciliation between the Congress and the British government.
2.  The agreement included a commitment by the British government to initiate a process for constitutional reforms leading to Dominion status for India, although the precise timeframe remained undefined.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact did lead to the release of many political prisoners, but it crucially excluded those convicted of violence.  This distinction underscores that the reconciliation was not absolute.  The British government maintained its commitment to upholding law and order, even within the context of negotiating with Gandhi. The selective release of prisoners reflected the ongoing power dynamics and the limitations of the agreement.

Statement 2 is correct. A key component of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was the British government's agreement to participate in a Round Table Conference to discuss constitutional reforms.  The goal of Dominion status was reaffirmed, although no specific timeline was established. This ambiguity later became a source of contention, as the Congress sought a clearer path towards complete independence. The pact ultimately aimed to create a platform for future constitutional negotiations and a pathway towards self-governance for India.


**5. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully autonomous Indian federation, granting complete control over all aspects of governance to elected Indian representatives.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier system of dyarchy, but retained significant powers for the Governor in each province.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 *did not* establish a fully autonomous Indian federation.  While it proposed the formation of an All-India Federation, this crucial element never materialized due to the non-participation of many princely states.  Furthermore, even within the proposed framework, significant powers remained reserved with the British government, particularly in areas like defense and foreign affairs.  The Act fell short of establishing complete Indian self-governance.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the 1935 Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy. This replaced the dual governance system (dyarchy) that had existed previously, granting provinces greater self-rule over their internal affairs.  However, this autonomy was not absolute; the Governor in each province retained substantial powers, particularly in matters of law and order and the protection of minority interests.  These "safeguards," as they were known, ensured British influence and control remained significant.


**6. With reference to the Round Table Conferences, consider the following statements:**

1.  The First Round Table Conference, held in 1930, saw the participation of the Indian National Congress, leading to significant progress in constitutional negotiations.
2. The Round Table Conferences ultimately resulted in the drafting and enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935, despite the Congress's boycott of the Third Conference.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian National Congress boycotted the First Round Table Conference in 1930, as they felt the conference's mandate and the British government's attitude were not conducive to meaningful negotiations.  The conference included various other Indian groups and representatives, but the absence of the Congress significantly hampered the progress of constitutional discussions. The Congress's boycott was a deliberate political strategy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Round Table Conferences, despite the Congress's boycott of the third conference, played a crucial role in shaping the Government of India Act, 1935.  The discussions and deliberations that took place, even without the Congress's direct participation, informed the eventual provisions of the Act. The Act's creation was a culmination of these conferences and subsequent British legislative action. While the Congress did not participate in the third conference, the earlier conferences laid the groundwork for the Act's formulation.


**7. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahatma Gandhi's first major public appearance in India was during the Champaran Satyagraha in 1917.
2.  Gandhi's involvement in the Kheda Satyagraha of 1918 focused primarily on addressing issues of peasant indebtedness and land revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha (1917) marked Mahatma Gandhi's first significant public campaign in India.  His involvement in this movement to support indigo farmers in Bihar established his reputation as a leader and demonstrated his commitment to using satyagraha for social and political change.  This event solidified his position as a prominent figure in Indian politics.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Kheda Satyagraha (1918) saw Gandhi actively supporting farmers in Gujarat who were facing severe economic hardship due to crop failure and high land revenue demands.  His efforts focused on mitigating the farmers' debt and advocating for fairer revenue policies. This movement further showcased his commitment to improving the lives of ordinary Indians.  The Kheda Satyagraha was a crucial step in Gandhi's development as a national leader.


**8. With reference to the All India Kisan Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Sahajanand Saraswati served as the president of the All India Kisan Sabha during its formative years and played a crucial role in shaping its ideology and programs.
2. The All India Kisan Sabha primarily focused on advocating for the rights of landowning farmers, neglecting the concerns of landless agricultural laborers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Sahajanand Saraswati was a prominent leader of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), and he served as its president during a crucial period of its development. His influence significantly shaped the organization's policies and its approach to advocating for peasant rights. His leadership was instrumental in defining the AIKS's goals and strategies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The All India Kisan Sabha's focus was not limited to landowning farmers; it actively advocated for the rights and welfare of all agricultural laborers, including landless peasants.  The AIKS's agenda included addressing issues of land ownership, tenancy rights, fair wages, and other concerns relevant to the broader agricultural workforce.  The organization recognized the diverse needs within the agricultural community.  The AIKS's activities and campaigns encompassed a wide range of agricultural workers.


**9.  With reference to the Self-Respect Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Self-Respect Movement, spearheaded by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, primarily focused on advocating for the rights of marginalized castes, challenging the dominance of the Brahminical social order.
2. The movement's strategies involved exclusively non-violent methods of protest and social reform, avoiding any confrontation with established religious or social institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Self-Respect Movement, founded by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar), was a significant social and political movement in South India.  Its primary aim was to uplift the status of marginalized castes and challenge the oppressive social hierarchy associated with the Brahminical system.  The movement directly challenged the dominance of upper-caste groups and advocated for social justice and equality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Self-Respect Movement emphasized self-respect and social reform, its methods were not strictly non-violent.  The movement engaged in direct confrontation with established religious and social norms, often challenging orthodox beliefs and practices through strong criticism and public discourse.  The movement's approach sometimes involved challenging existing power structures in a confrontational manner.  It is inaccurate to portray the movement as purely non-violent.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian National Congress:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address, advocated for self-government, a concept he termed "Swaraj," mirroring the governance model of the United Kingdom.
2.  The Surat Split of 1907 resulted from disagreements between moderate and extremist factions, with the moderates ultimately gaining control of the Congress organization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji, in his presidential address to the Indian National Congress, explicitly advocated for "self-government" or "Swaraj," drawing a parallel to the governance systems of the United Kingdom and its colonies. This marked a significant shift in the Congress's articulation of its political goals.  The demand for Swaraj, though initially interpreted differently by various factions, became a central rallying point for the nationalist movement.  Naoroji's articulation was pivotal in shaping the future trajectory of the Congress's political aspirations.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Surat Split of 1907 was a significant event in the history of the Indian National Congress.  It stemmed from deep ideological differences between the moderate and extremist wings of the Congress.  The moderates, favoring gradual constitutional methods, ultimately outmaneuvered the extremists, who advocated for more assertive and radical approaches. This led to a temporary fracturing of the nationalist movement, although the underlying tensions continued to shape Indian politics. The moderates' success in controlling the Congress apparatus after the split is well-documented.


**2. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's contributions to the Indian freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Champaran Satyagraha, initiated by Gandhi, primarily focused on addressing the grievances of indigo planters against the British Raj.
2.  Gandhi's advocacy of Satyagraha and Ahimsa significantly influenced the Quit India Movement, shaping its non-violent approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Champaran Satyagraha, though led by Gandhi, primarily addressed the exploitation of peasant farmers by British indigo planters, not the grievances of the planters themselves.  Gandhi's intervention was triggered by the plight of the farmers who were forced into unfavorable contracts by the planters. The Satyagraha successfully challenged the exploitative system and became a landmark event in the development of Gandhian philosophy and tactics.  The focus was on the oppressed peasantry, not the indigo planters.

Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha and Ahimsa (non-violent resistance) profoundly shaped the Indian freedom struggle.  The Quit India Movement, although marked by some instances of violence, was fundamentally guided by Gandhi's principles of non-violent resistance.  His call for "Do or Die" was a powerful expression of this philosophy.  The movement's widespread participation and its impact on the British Raj were directly linked to the influence of Gandhi's non-violent approach.  The movement’s success, though limited in achieving immediate independence, significantly weakened British control.


**3. With reference to the impact of the British Raj on India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Permanent Settlement, implemented primarily in Bengal, granted complete ownership rights to the ryots (cultivators), fostering agricultural prosperity.
2.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, aimed at suppressing dissent, was repealed in 1882 due to widespread public opposition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Permanent Settlement, while granting proprietary rights to Zamindars, did not grant complete ownership rights to the ryots (cultivators).  Instead, it created a system of tenancy, often leading to exploitation and impoverishment of the peasantry. The Zamindars, as landowners, were responsible for collecting revenue from the ryots, and often imposed high rents, leading to widespread rural indebtedness and agricultural stagnation in many areas.  The system did not ensure agricultural prosperity for the ryots as intended.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, enacted by Lord Lytton's government, severely restricted the freedom of the Indian-language press.  It was widely seen as an attempt to suppress nationalist sentiment and criticism of the British Raj.  The Act faced significant public opposition, leading to its eventual repeal in 1882 under pressure from public opinion and liberal elements within the British government.  This repeal demonstrated the growing power of public opinion in influencing British policy.



**4. With reference to the early nationalist movement in India (1885-1905), consider the following statements:**

1. The early nationalists primarily focused on securing immediate independence through armed rebellion, rejecting constitutional methods.
2. The Indian National Congress, during this period, effectively mobilized mass support across diverse sections of Indian society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The early phase of the Indian nationalist movement (1885-1905), often termed the "moderate phase," primarily employed constitutional methods of agitation.  Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and others focused on petitions, public appeals, and constitutional reforms within the framework of the existing British system. While some advocated for more assertive measures, armed rebellion was not the primary focus during this period. The emphasis was on gradual reform through constitutional means.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Indian National Congress aimed to represent the interests of all Indians, its early phase did not effectively mobilize mass support across all sections of society.  Its membership and influence were largely confined to the educated urban elite.  The Congress's reach into rural areas and among less privileged groups was limited during this period.  The movement's base remained largely confined to the educated classes in urban areas.  Broadening its base to encompass the wider populace would be a challenge tackled in later phases of the movement.


**5. With reference to the Dyarchy system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dyarchy, introduced by the Government of India Act 1919, divided power between the Governor-General and the provincial legislatures, giving significant control to the elected representatives.
2. The system was implemented at both the central and provincial levels of government, aiming for a gradual transfer of power to Indians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Government of India Act of 1919 did introduce Dyarchy (dual governance), it did *not* divide power equally between the Governor-General and provincial legislatures.  Instead, it created a system where certain subjects (reserved subjects) remained under the direct control of the Governor, while other subjects (transferred subjects) were administered by ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures. The Governor retained considerable power, especially in areas deemed vital to British interests. This system was a compromise, falling short of providing significant control to elected representatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Dyarchy system, as implemented through the 1919 Act, was primarily applied at the *provincial* level, not at the central level. The central government remained under the direct control of the British Viceroy.  The aim was to experiment with limited self-governance at the provincial level before considering further devolution of power. The central government remained firmly under British control, preventing a widespread transfer of power.

**1. With reference to the Rowlatt Act, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act's primary aim was to suppress revolutionary terrorism, particularly in Bengal, through enhanced police powers and restrictions on civil liberties.
2.  The Act's passage led to widespread protests and the launch of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, aimed to curb revolutionary activities and enhance the government's power to suppress dissent.  While it didn't specifically target Bengal alone,  the Act's provisions for detention without trial and restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly were particularly impactful in regions experiencing significant revolutionary activity, including Bengal. The Act was a response to the perceived threat of revolutionary terrorism and aimed to provide the government with the tools to preemptively address such threats.  It is important to note that the Act's impact was far-reaching and not limited to any single region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rowlatt Act directly led to the Rowlatt Satyagraha, a campaign of civil disobedience initiated by Mahatma Gandhi.  However, the Non-Cooperation Movement was a later and more extensive campaign launched in 1920, primarily in response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the broader context of British rule, not solely the Rowlatt Act. While the Rowlatt Act heightened tensions and contributed to the atmosphere of discontent leading up to the Non-Cooperation Movement, it was not the direct trigger. The Rowlatt Satyagraha, though significant, was a more localized and limited protest compared to the Non-Cooperation Movement.


**2. With reference to the Simon Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Simon Commission's recommendations significantly influenced the Government of India Act of 1935, particularly concerning the establishment of provincial autonomy and the restructuring of the Indian federal system.
2. The Commission's all-British composition led to its complete boycott by the Indian National Congress, significantly impacting its credibility and effectiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Simon Commission, appointed in 1927, produced a report that significantly shaped the Government of India Act of 1935.  While the Act incorporated several recommendations, including the establishment of provincial autonomy and a federal structure, it's crucial to note that the final Act wasn't a direct adoption of all the Commission's proposals.  The British government considered various factors and perspectives before finalising the Act. The Commission's recommendations served as a key input but not the sole determinant of the Act's provisions. The Act's structure, including the federal system and provincial autonomy, however, reflected the Simon Commission's recommendations to a large degree.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. The Indian National Congress did indeed boycott the Simon Commission due to its all-British membership.  However, to say it was a *complete* boycott is an oversimplification. Some Indian groups and individuals did participate in the Commission's work, albeit under protest.  The boycott by the Congress was a powerful political statement, but it didn't represent a unanimous rejection across all of India’s political spectrum.  The Congress's boycott significantly hampered the Commission's efforts to gain widespread legitimacy and acceptance. However, the Commission still gathered considerable information and produced a report which influenced the future of the Indian constitutional structure.



**3. With reference to the Congress Socialist Party, consider the following statements:**

1. The CSP advocated for the complete independence of India, aligning with the broader goals of the Indian National Congress while incorporating socialist principles into their approach.
2.  The CSP's ideology combined Marxist-Leninist principles with Gandhian non-violent methods, creating a unique approach to achieving independence and social justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Congress Socialist Party (CSP), a faction within the Indian National Congress, unequivocally supported the goal of complete independence for India.  Their socialist leanings influenced their methods and priorities within the larger nationalist movement, emphasizing the need for economic and social reforms alongside political freedom.  The CSP aimed to integrate socialist principles into the Congress's overall strategy for independence.  They did not advocate for a separate socialist state but sought to transform Indian society from within the framework of an independent nation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CSP drew inspiration from socialist and Marxist ideologies, their approach to achieving independence was not a direct blend of Marxist-Leninist principles and Gandhian non-violence.  Their emphasis was primarily on socialist economic reforms and a more radical approach to mass mobilization compared to the mainstream Congress, but they did not necessarily advocate for armed revolution or explicitly reject Gandhian principles.  The CSP's ideology was far more nuanced and complex than a simple combination of these two seemingly disparate approaches.  Their approach was more akin to democratic socialism than a strict adherence to Marxist-Leninist tenets.


**4. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Resolution, passed by the All India Congress Committee in August 1942, directly called for the immediate and unconditional transfer of power to an interim Indian government.
2. The movement's spontaneous nature and widespread participation, despite the arrest of key Congress leaders, demonstrated the depth of Indian nationalist sentiment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Quit India Resolution demanded an end to British rule in India, but it didn't explicitly call for the immediate formation of an interim Indian government.  The resolution focused on the immediate ending of British rule, but the specifics of the transition to self-governance were left somewhat vague.  The demand was for a complete end to British control, not a specific transitional arrangement. The resolution primarily focused on the immediate removal of British authority rather than detailing the immediate establishment of a specific governmental structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Quit India Movement, launched in August 1942, is notable for its spontaneous and widespread nature despite the swift arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and other key Congress leaders.  The movement's success in mobilizing large segments of the population, including students, workers, and peasants, underscored the deep-seated nationalist sentiments and the widespread desire for independence among the Indian people. The movement’s ability to sustain itself despite the absence of its leadership demonstrated a profound level of popular mobilization.  The largely spontaneous nature of the movement also showcased the strength of underlying nationalist sentiment.


**5. With reference to the Radcliffe Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Radcliffe Committee was responsible for demarcating the boundaries between India and Pakistan based on the principles of religious demographics and administrative feasibility.
2. The Committee's work was completed swiftly and efficiently, minimizing conflict and ensuring a smooth transition during the partition process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Radcliffe Committee, appointed in 1947, was tasked with the extremely challenging job of dividing British India into India and Pakistan.  The demarcation was primarily based on the principle of separating Muslim-majority areas from Hindu-majority areas, although this was a highly complex and often contentious process, with significant implications for the movement of populations and the resulting communal violence.  The Committee's work aimed to balance religious demographics with administrative practicality, but this was far from a simple task. The principles of religious demography and administrative feasibility were the primary guidelines, but the implementation was fraught with challenges.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Radcliffe Committee's work was carried out under immense pressure and within a very short timeframe.  The haste and the complexities involved in the division led to numerous disputes and criticisms regarding the drawn boundaries, many of which became flashpoints for communal violence and displacement. The rushed nature of the task directly contributed to the problems and violence that ensued after partition. The work was far from smooth and resulted in significant problems that continue to have implications today.


**6. With reference to the 1929 Session of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1. The session formally declared Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as the ultimate goal of the Congress, marking a significant shift in its political objectives.
2. The session witnessed a major split within the Congress, leading to the formation of a separate socialist faction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress in 1929 is historically significant for its formal adoption of Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as the Congress's goal.  This marked a clear departure from earlier demands for dominion status and represented a more assertive and radical stance towards British rule.  The declaration of Purna Swaraj signaled a decisive shift towards a complete break from British authority.  This was a major turning point in the Indian independence movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While internal disagreements and ideological differences existed within the Congress, the 1929 session did not lead to a major split resulting in the immediate formation of a separate socialist faction.  The Congress Socialist Party (CSP) emerged later, evolving from various socialist and left-wing groups within the Congress.  The 1929 session primarily focused on the goal of independence and the strategy for achieving it, rather than creating internal divisions that led to immediate factional splits. While tensions between different ideological factions within the Congress were present, the 1929 session didn't result in a formal split. The CSP would form later, consolidating various existing socialist groups within the Congress.


**7. With reference to the Congress Ministries' resignation in 1939, consider the following statements:**

1. The resignations were primarily a response to the Viceroy's decision to involve India in World War II without consulting the Congress leadership.
2. The resignations significantly weakened the Congress's position and allowed the British government to more easily implement its policies during the war.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Congress ministries in seven provinces resigned in 1939 primarily as a protest against the British government's decision to involve India in World War II without the consent or consultation of the elected Congress leadership.  The Congress vehemently opposed India's participation in the war without a prior agreement on the future of India's independence.  The feeling was that India was being drawn into a war without having a say in its own destiny.  This was a major factor in their decision to resign.  The lack of consultation and the perceived disregard for Indian self-determination were central to the resignations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the resignations did temporarily remove the Congress from direct administrative power in those provinces, it did not significantly weaken its overall political position.  In fact, the resignations strengthened the Congress's image as a principled opponent of British rule and further fueled the nationalist movement.  The resignations helped solidify the Congress's position as a staunch defender of Indian independence and its opposition to the war. The move was a calculated political strategy that ultimately helped bolster the Congress’s image and standing.


**8. With reference to the Dandi March, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dandi March was a symbolic act of defiance against the British salt tax, which disproportionately affected the poorest segments of Indian society.
2. The march's success was primarily due to Gandhi's ability to mobilize large-scale, coordinated protests across various regions of India simultaneously.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dandi March, undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930, was a symbolic act of civil disobedience targeting the British salt tax.  The tax was a significant burden on the poor, who had limited access to salt and were heavily reliant on government-controlled sources.  The march highlighted the unjust nature of this tax and mobilized support for the cause of Indian independence.  The selection of salt as the focal point was a deliberate strategy to directly impact the lives of ordinary Indians.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Dandi March inspired similar protests and acts of civil disobedience across India, it wasn't a centrally coordinated, large-scale, simultaneous movement.  The march itself was a carefully planned event that served as a catalyst for widespread defiance, but the subsequent protests were largely spontaneous and locally organized.  Gandhi's leadership and the symbolic nature of the march were crucial in inspiring widespread action, but the movement's regional spread wasn't the result of a single, perfectly orchestrated plan.  The movement's regional variations highlight the decentralized nature of the response to the Dandi March.


**9. With reference to the Nehru Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nehru Report advocated for dominion status as the ultimate political goal for India, rejecting the demand for complete independence.
2. The Report was widely accepted by various Indian political groups, creating a broad consensus on the path towards self-governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928 by a committee headed by Motilal Nehru, proposed a dominion status for India within the British Commonwealth.  It rejected the demand for complete independence at that time, focusing instead on a framework for self-governance within the existing imperial structure.  The report laid out a detailed constitutional framework for a dominion status, outlining the powers and responsibilities of the Indian government.  The proposal for dominion status reflected a pragmatic approach to achieving self-rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Nehru Report was initially welcomed by some sections of the Indian National Congress, it did not achieve universal acceptance among various Indian political groups.  The report faced significant criticism from both the more conservative and the more radical factions, highlighting the lack of a united front on the path to self-governance.  The report's failure to gain broad acceptance reflected the diverse political landscape and the lack of a unified vision for India's future.  Groups like the Muslim League and some within the Congress itself voiced significant objections.

**1. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement witnessed significant participation from industrial workers in major cities like Bombay and Ahmedabad, but saw limited involvement from agricultural laborers.
2.  While Mahatma Gandhi's leadership was crucial in initiating the movement, the arrest of top Congress leaders led to a largely spontaneous and decentralized nature of the protests across various regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Quit India Movement saw widespread participation from various segments of Indian society, including a substantial number of industrial workers in major urban centers like Bombay and Ahmedabad. However, it's inaccurate to suggest that agricultural laborers were minimally involved.  Peasant participation was crucial, particularly in regions like Bihar and the United Provinces, where the movement took a strong rural character. The movement’s strength lay in its broad-based nature, encompassing both urban and rural populations, though the nature and intensity of participation varied regionally.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Quit India Movement was initiated under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership, and the  "Quit India" resolution was passed at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee.  However, the preemptive arrest of virtually all the top Congress leadership on August 9, 1942, immediately before the planned launch, dramatically altered the movement's trajectory.  This left the movement largely leaderless, resulting in a highly spontaneous and decentralized eruption of protests across diverse regions. The absence of central direction resulted in a diverse expression of resistance, ranging from peaceful demonstrations to more militant actions. The decentralized nature is a key characteristic of the Quit India Movement, distinguishing it from earlier, more centrally organized movements.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Government of India Act of 1935:**

1. The Act established a federal structure comprising British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states, with the latter's participation contingent upon specific population thresholds and seat allocations in the Council of States.
2.  Provincial autonomy under the Act replaced dyarchy, granting provinces significant financial powers and independent legal identities, though Governors retained considerable influence and control, particularly concerning minority rights and law and order.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 aimed to establish an All-India Federation, incorporating British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and the princely states.  However, the Act's success hinged on the participation of the princely states.  Specific conditions were laid out for their inclusion, including a minimum number of states agreeing to join and a specific population threshold being met.  These conditions were ultimately not fulfilled, preventing the full-fledged federation from ever materializing.  This aspect of the Act highlights the inherent complexities of integrating the diverse political entities within India under a unified governance structure.


Statement 2 is also correct. A significant feature of the 1935 Act was the establishment of provincial autonomy, effectively replacing the earlier dyarchical system.  This granted provinces greater self-governance, including substantial financial powers and independent legal identities.  However, it's crucial to note that the Act did not completely transfer power to the provinces.  Governors, appointed by the British Crown, retained significant powers, especially regarding matters concerning minority rights, law and order, and the protection of British interests. This retention of gubernatorial powers ensured that the British government could still exercise considerable influence and control over the provinces, even under the guise of provincial autonomy.  The balance of power between the provincial legislatures and the Governors remained a point of contention and a key factor influencing political dynamics in the years leading up to independence.


**3. With reference to the Nehru Report (1928), consider the following statements:**

1. The report advocated for dominion status for India, rejecting the demand for complete independence, and proposed a system of joint electorates with reservations for minorities, aiming to secure their representation without resorting to separate electorates.
2.  While the report was approved by the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress, it faced significant opposition from younger Congress leaders who favored complete independence and viewed dominion status as insufficient.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nehru Report, drafted by a committee headed by Motilal Nehru, proposed a dominion status for India within the British Commonwealth.  It explicitly rejected the demand for complete independence at that time, reflecting a more gradualist approach to achieving self-rule. A key feature of the report was its proposal for a system of joint electorates with reserved seats for minorities.  This aimed to address the concerns of minority communities while avoiding the potentially divisive implications of separate electorates which would have further fragmented Indian society. The emphasis on joint electorates highlights the report's attempt to balance the goal of self-governance with the need to protect the interests of minority groups, a crucial aspect of constitutional design in a pluralistic society.


Statement 2 is also correct. Although the Nehru Report was officially approved by the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress in December 1928, it did not represent a unanimous consensus within the Congress.  Younger leaders, notably Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, strongly opposed the report's acceptance of dominion status.  They argued that it fell short of the ultimate goal of complete independence (Purna Swaraj) and that the Congress should aim for nothing less.  This internal dissent within the Congress regarding the report's recommendations foreshadowed the growing ideological divisions within the nationalist movement, highlighting the tension between more moderate and radical approaches to the struggle for independence.  The opposition to the Nehru Report ultimately contributed to the shift in the Congress's stance towards demanding complete independence, a pivotal moment in the history of the Indian independence movement.


**4. With reference to the  Gandhi-Irwin Pact (1931), consider the following statements:**

1. The Pact resulted in the unconditional release of all political prisoners, including those convicted of violence, and the complete withdrawal of all emergency ordinances imposed during the Civil Disobedience Movement.
2.  While the Pact led to the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement, it failed to secure the commutation of death sentences for revolutionary leaders like Bhagat Singh and his comrades, despite Gandhi's efforts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Gandhi-Irwin Pact, while securing the release of many political prisoners, did not include the release of all those convicted of violence.  The pact specifically stated that only those political prisoners not convicted of violence would be released. The pact also did not lead to the complete withdrawal of all emergency ordinances. Some ordinances remained in effect, demonstrating the limitations of the agreement in fully reversing the government's repressive measures. The selective nature of prisoner releases and the continued enforcement of some ordinances highlight the compromises inherent in the pact and the continued power imbalance between the Indian nationalists and the British government.


Statement 2 is correct. A key failure of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was its inability to secure the commutation of death sentences for Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru.  Despite Gandhi's efforts to plead their case, the British government refused to grant clemency. This failure to secure their release fueled criticism of the pact among more radical elements within the nationalist movement who viewed it as a compromise that failed to fully address the demands for justice and freedom.  The execution of these prominent revolutionaries, shortly before the Karachi Congress session, further underscored the limitations of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact in achieving a complete reconciliation between the Indian nationalists and the British Raj.  The incident became a significant factor in shaping the subsequent course of the independence movement.


**5. With reference to the Communal Award (1932) and the Poona Pact (1932), consider the following statements:**

1. The Communal Award, announced by Ramsay MacDonald, allocated separate electorates and reserved seats for various religious and caste groups, including the depressed classes, sparking widespread opposition from nationalists who viewed it as a tool of divide-and-rule.
2. The Poona Pact, negotiated between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, retained separate electorates for the depressed classes while increasing the number of reserved seats, thus addressing Ambedkar's concerns regarding their political representation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Communal Award, announced by British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in August 1932, was a significant event in the lead-up to India's independence.  It established separate electorates and reserved seats for various minority communities, including Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Anglo-Indians, and the depressed classes (Dalits). This decision was met with considerable opposition from many Indian nationalists, including Mahatma Gandhi, who viewed the Communal Award as a divisive strategy employed by the British government to weaken the unity of the Indian nationalist movement.  The Award is seen as a classic example of the British policy of "divide and rule," designed to exacerbate existing communal tensions and prevent the formation of a united front against British rule.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Poona Pact, a crucial agreement reached between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar in September 1932, significantly altered the provisions of the Communal Award.  It abolished the system of separate electorates for the depressed classes, which had been a major point of contention.  Instead, it increased the number of reserved seats for the depressed classes within the joint electorates, aiming to secure their representation without resorting to separate electorates. This change represented a compromise between Gandhi's emphasis on Hindu unity and Ambedkar's advocacy for the political empowerment of the depressed classes. The abandonment of separate electorates was a significant victory for those who sought to maintain a unified Indian nation, even amidst the existing societal divisions.  The Poona Pact ultimately replaced the contentious aspect of separate electorates for the depressed classes from the Communal Award.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement witnessed significant participation from workers in Ahmedabad and Jamshedpur, bolstering its nationwide impact.
2.  Lal Bahadur Shastri's leadership role in organizing parallel governments in Bihar and Bengal significantly impacted the movement's success in these regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quit India Movement saw widespread participation from various sections of society, including industrial workers.  Ahmedabad and Jamshedpur, significant industrial hubs, contributed substantially to the movement's momentum and scale. The participation of workers demonstrated the movement's reach beyond the urban elite and into the working class.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Lal Bahadur Shastri was involved in the Quit India Movement, he did not play a leading role in establishing parallel governments in Bihar and Bengal.  The movement's decentralized nature resulted in the spontaneous emergence of parallel governments in various regions, often led by local leaders. Attributing a significant leadership role to Shastri in this specific context is inaccurate.  The leadership in these regions was more localized and multifaceted, not solely attributed to one individual.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the impact and spread of the Quit India Movement:**

1. The movement's intensity was uniform across all regions of India, with equal levels of participation from different social groups.
2.  The Indian National Army (INA), though operating outside India, significantly boosted the morale and support for the Quit India Movement within the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Quit India Movement's intensity varied significantly across different regions of India.  While some areas witnessed widespread and intense participation, others saw more muted responses. The level of participation also differed among various social groups; certain groups were more actively involved than others.  The movement's success was not uniform due to factors like differing levels of British control, communication networks, and local leadership.

Statement 2 is correct. Although operating outside India, the activities of the INA (Indian National Army) played a crucial role in boosting the morale of the Indian people and enhancing support for the Quit India Movement. The INA's successes, even if short-lived, provided a beacon of hope and defiance against British rule, inspiring many within India to participate more actively in the movement. The news of the INA’s activities fuelled nationalist sentiment and encouraged resistance.



**3. With reference to the participants and leadership of the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement was exclusively led by Mahatma Gandhi, with limited participation from other prominent Congress leaders.
2.  The participation of students, Satyagrahis, and workers formed the backbone of the movement, while the upper classes remained largely passive.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi was the pivotal figure and provided the ideological framework for the Quit India Movement, it was not solely led by him. Many other Congress leaders played crucial roles, although their actions were often overshadowed by Gandhi's prominence and subsequent arrest.  The movement's decentralized nature meant leadership emerged from various levels and regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Quit India Movement's strength lay in the mass participation of various sections, notably students, Satyagrahis, and workers. These groups formed the backbone of the movement's protests and actions.  While some sections of the upper classes remained loyal to the British, the movement's broad appeal was evident in the involvement of lower and middle-class participants.


**4. With reference to the aftermath of the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The immediate aftermath of the movement witnessed a period of sustained and widespread political activity across India.
2.  The Bengal famine of 1943, while unrelated to the movement, further exacerbated existing anti-British sentiment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The immediate aftermath of the Quit India Movement was marked by a period of relative political inactivity within India. The government's harsh repression, coupled with the arrest of key leaders, significantly suppressed overt political action. The movement's momentum was effectively broken by the British response.

Statement 2 is correct. The devastating Bengal famine of 1943, while not directly caused by the Quit India Movement, significantly fueled anti-British sentiment. The widespread suffering and death caused by the famine, which many believed could have been mitigated with more effective government action, further intensified existing resentment against British rule.  This contributed to the growing desire for independence.


**5.  With reference to the locations where the Quit India Movement was active, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement primarily focused on urban centers, with minimal participation from rural areas.
2.  The movement's activities were geographically concentrated in the regions of Bombay, Poona, and Ahmedabad, with limited presence elsewhere.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Quit India Movement was not limited to urban centers; it witnessed significant participation from rural areas as well.  The movement's reach extended to various regions, both urban and rural, demonstrating its widespread popular support.  Peasant participation was substantial in many regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bombay, Poona, and Ahmedabad were important centers of activity during the Quit India Movement, the movement's reach was far more extensive.  It spread across a vast geographical area, encompassing various regions of India, including Bihar, Bengal, the United Provinces, and several princely states.  The movement's decentralized nature meant that activity wasn't restricted to a few key cities.


**6. With reference to the responses to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The British government responded with swift and decisive military action, employing only conventional methods of suppression.
2. The movement resulted in an estimated 10,000 deaths due to police and military firing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The British government's response to the Quit India Movement was far from limited to conventional methods.  The authorities employed brutal and widespread repression, including mass arrests, censorship, and the use of excessive force against protestors.  The scale of repression was significant, exceeding the use of conventional policing strategies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Quit India Movement resulted in a significant loss of life, with estimates placing the number of deaths due to police and military firing at around 10,000.  This highlights the violent nature of the British response and the movement's inherent risks.  The high death toll underscores the movement's impact and the government's determination to suppress it.


**7. With reference to the ideological influences on the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement was solely based on Gandhian principles of non-violence and civil disobedience.
2. The movement was significantly influenced by the global context of World War II and the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhian principles of non-violence and civil disobedience formed the core ideology of the Quit India Movement, the movement's actual execution deviated from strict adherence to non-violence in several instances. Spontaneous acts of violence erupted in many areas in response to police brutality.  The movement's decentralized nature resulted in variations in the application of its core philosophy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Quit India Movement was profoundly influenced by the global context of World War II and the Japanese advance in Southeast Asia.  The Japanese threat to India's borders heightened existing anti-British sentiment and added urgency to the demand for independence.  The global geopolitical situation played a crucial role in shaping the movement's timing and intensity.  The British were facing pressure on multiple fronts and were less able to suppress the movement as effectively as they had in previous years.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the long-term consequences of the Quit India Movement:**

1. The movement directly led to India's immediate independence in 1947.
2. The movement significantly weakened the British government's control and authority in India, paving the way for eventual independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Quit India Movement did not directly result in India's immediate independence. While it significantly weakened British authority, independence came only after further political negotiations, the end of World War II, and the shifting global power dynamics.  The movement was a critical juncture, but not the sole cause of independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Quit India Movement played a crucial role in weakening British control and authority in India.  The movement demonstrated the widespread and deep-seated desire for independence, highlighting the limitations of British power and the strength of Indian resistance. The scale of the movement and the British government's subsequent struggle to suppress it irrevocably changed the dynamics of the struggle for independence.  It significantly contributed to the eventual transfer of power.

**1. With reference to the Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swadeshi Movement witnessed significant participation from women, primarily through boycotts of British goods and promotion of indigenous products.  However, their roles were largely confined to the domestic sphere, with limited involvement in the more radical aspects of the movement.
2.  The Moderates within the Indian National Congress actively supported the Swadeshi Movement, viewing it as a crucial step towards achieving self-governance through constitutional means. They believed in peaceful methods and opposed the extremist approach.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While women participated actively in the Swadeshi Movement, their roles were primarily focused on boycotts, swadeshi promotion, and supporting the movement within their homes and communities.  Their participation was significant in terms of numbers and contribution to the movement's overall success, but it's important to note the limitations imposed by the societal norms of the time, which often restricted women's public roles.  The statement accurately reflects this nuanced participation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Moderates within the Indian National Congress *strongly opposed* the Swadeshi Movement, particularly its extremist wing.  They viewed the extremist methods as disruptive and counterproductive to their goal of gradual constitutional reforms. The Moderates advocated for a more measured and peaceful approach to achieving self-rule, fundamentally disagreeing with the more radical tactics employed by the Extremists during the Swadeshi Movement.  Their opposition formed a significant internal conflict within the Congress during this period.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Cooperation Movement:**

1.  The Non-Cooperation Movement was primarily a rural-based movement, with limited participation from urban centers and industrial workers.  The movement's impact was most pronounced in rural areas, where the boycott of government institutions and services had a more direct effect.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, while resulting in the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement, did not significantly impact the overall trajectory of the Indian Independence struggle. The movement's core principles remained influential in subsequent movements.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement had a significant presence in both rural and urban areas. While rural participation was substantial, the movement also saw considerable involvement from urban populations, including students, professionals, and even some industrial workers. The boycott of schools, colleges, and government services affected both rural and urban settings.  The statement oversimplifies the geographical reach of the movement.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a mob of protestors set fire to a police station, resulting in the death of policemen, was a pivotal moment.  Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement in response to this incident had a profound and lasting impact. It demonstrated the fragility of the movement's non-violent approach and highlighted the challenges of maintaining discipline within large-scale protests. The suspension significantly altered the momentum of the struggle and led to a period of reassessment and regrouping for the nationalist movement.


**3. With reference to the Cripps Mission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cripps Mission's proposals explicitly guaranteed complete independence for India after the Second World War, contingent on the successful formation of a Constituent Assembly. This promise was a key element of the proposals aimed at securing Indian cooperation in the war effort.
2.  The Cripps Mission's failure was primarily due to the Congress's rejection of the proposal for a Constituent Assembly, which they deemed inadequate for achieving immediate independence.  The Congress viewed the proposals as insufficient to address their immediate demands.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did *not* offer complete independence immediately.  It proposed a dominion status for India *after* the Second World War, with the option for provinces to opt out and negotiate separate agreements with Britain.  The promise of eventual self-governance was conditional upon the formation of a Constituent Assembly and the successful negotiation of a post-war constitutional settlement.  The lack of immediate independence was a major point of contention.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Congress's rejection of the Cripps proposals stemmed from several factors, including the lack of immediate independence, the provision for provinces to opt out, and the continued presence of British authority during the war.  While the Constituent Assembly was an important aspect of the proposals, the Congress's concerns went beyond simply the structure of the Assembly itself.  The statement oversimplifies the reasons for the Congress's rejection.


**4.  With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Movement was characterized by widespread violence and the establishment of numerous parallel governments across various regions of India. These "parallel governments" temporarily exercised administrative control in certain areas, challenging British authority.  However, these were short-lived and ultimately unsuccessful.
2.  The Muslim League actively participated in the Quit India Movement, seeing it as an opportunity to advance their demand for Pakistan and gain greater autonomy for Muslim communities within India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Quit India Movement, while initially envisioned as a non-violent movement, witnessed significant instances of violence and civil unrest across various regions of India.  The absence of key Congress leaders due to their arrest led to a more spontaneous and, in many cases, less disciplined response.  The formation of "parallel governments" in some areas was a testament to the widespread discontent and the temporary erosion of British control.  These instances, while significant, were short-lived, and the British eventually suppressed the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Muslim League *did not* participate in the Quit India Movement.  In fact, the League opposed the movement, fearing that a sudden withdrawal of British power would leave the Muslim minority vulnerable to the Hindu majority.  The League's focus remained on achieving a separate Muslim state (Pakistan), and the Quit India Movement did not align with their immediate political goals.  Their opposition further complicated the already complex situation during this period.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Individual Satyagraha:**

1.  The Individual Satyagraha was initiated by the Congress as a strategy to maintain pressure on the British government while avoiding the large-scale mass movements that had previously led to significant violence and repression.  It was a more controlled approach to civil disobedience.
2.  The second Satyagrahi chosen in the Individual Satyagraha was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who played a crucial role in the movement by organizing and mobilizing support for the campaign.  His participation was vital in ensuring the movement's success.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Individual Satyagraha was indeed a carefully planned strategy by the Congress to sustain pressure on the British without resorting to the large-scale, potentially violent mass movements that had characterized previous campaigns.  It involved selecting individual Satyagrahis who would undertake non-violent acts of defiance, one at a time.  This approach aimed to minimize the risk of widespread violence and allow the Congress to maintain a degree of control over the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The second Satyagrahi in the Individual Satyagraha was Jawaharlal Nehru, not Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.  While Patel was a prominent figure in the Indian National Congress and played a crucial role in many movements, Nehru was chosen to follow Vinoba Bhave as the second participant in this specific campaign.  The statement incorrectly attributes the second Satyagrahi's role to Patel.


**6. With reference to the Shimla Conference, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lord Mountbatten, as the Viceroy of India at the time, played a key role in convening and overseeing the Shimla Conference, aiming to forge a consensus among Indian leaders on the formation of an interim government.  His involvement was crucial to the conference's proceedings.
2.  The Shimla Conference was successful in establishing a unified interim government that included representatives from both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, paving the way for a smoother transition of power to India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Lord Wavell, not Lord Mountbatten, was the Viceroy of India during the Shimla Conference in 1945.  He convened the conference with the aim of forming an interim government involving representatives from major Indian political parties.  Wavell's attempt to bridge the gap between the Congress and the Muslim League through the conference ultimately failed, but his role in organizing the meeting was crucial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Shimla Conference did *not* result in the formation of a unified interim government.  The conference failed due to disagreements between the Congress and the Muslim League over representation in the proposed interim government.  The Muslim League's demand for exclusive representation of Muslims proved to be an insurmountable obstacle, leading to the collapse of negotiations and the failure of the conference to achieve its primary objective.


**7. With reference to the Interim Government formed in 1946, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad held the crucial portfolio of Defence in the Interim Government, overseeing the country's military and security during this critical period. This portfolio was essential for maintaining stability during the transition.
2.  The Interim Government marked a significant step towards the transfer of power, although it did not fully transfer all executive powers from the British Viceroy to Indian leaders.  The Viceroy retained some significant powers and responsibilities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad did not hold the Defence portfolio in the Interim Government.  The Defence portfolio was held by Baldev Singh, a Sikh leader.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad held the portfolio of Food and Agriculture during this period.  The statement misattributes an important cabinet position.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Interim Government, formed in 1946, was a significant step in the process of transferring power from British hands to Indian leaders.  However, it's crucial to remember that the Viceroy (Lord Wavell) still retained considerable authority and control, particularly in matters of defence and foreign affairs.  The transfer of power was not complete, and the Interim Government operated within the existing constitutional framework, with the Viceroy exercising significant influence and residual powers.


**8. With reference to the 'Purna Swaraj' resolution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The resolution for 'Purna Swaraj' (complete independence) was passed at the Lahore session of the Indian National Congress in 1929, under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru.  This marked a significant shift towards demanding complete independence from British rule.
2.  Dadabhai Naoroji, a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, played a significant role in drafting and advocating for the 'Purna Swaraj' resolution.  His influence was instrumental in shaping the resolution's content.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lahore session of the Indian National Congress in 1929 did indeed pass the resolution declaring 'Purna Swaraj' as the goal of the Indian National Congress.  Jawaharlal Nehru was the president of the Congress during this session, and the declaration of 'Purna Swaraj' marked a significant turning point in the Indian independence movement, shifting the focus from dominion status to complete independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Dadabhai Naoroji was a highly influential leader of the Indian National Congress and an early advocate for self-rule, he did not play a direct role in the drafting or advocacy of the 'Purna Swaraj' resolution.  The resolution was largely shaped by the younger generation of nationalist leaders who had come to prominence in the post-World War I era.  The statement incorrectly attributes a role to Naoroji in the context of the 1929 resolution.


**9. With reference to the individuals associated with various Satyagrahas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajendra Prasad was closely associated with the Kheda Satyagraha, playing a key organizational role in mobilizing support and coordinating the movement's activities. His contributions were instrumental to the movement's success.
2.  Vallabhbhai Patel's leadership in the Ahmedabad Mill Workers' Satyagraha is well-documented, demonstrating his skill in organizing and negotiating with industrialists on behalf of the workers.  His success in this Satyagraha established him as a prominent leader.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajendra Prasad was primarily associated with the Champaran Satyagraha, not the Kheda Satyagraha.  While he was a prominent Congress leader and participated in various movements, his key role was in Champaran.  The statement incorrectly links him to the Kheda Satyagraha.

Statement 2 is correct. Vallabhbhai Patel's leadership in the Ahmedabad Mill Workers' Satyagraha is well-documented and considered a major success.  He skillfully organized the workers, negotiated with mill owners, and achieved significant improvements in workers' conditions.  This Satyagraha showcased his organizational and negotiating abilities and significantly contributed to his rise as a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress.


**10. With reference to the Congress Ministries that resigned in 1939, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Congress Ministries resigned in response to the Viceroy's decision to involve India in the Second World War without consulting the Congress leadership.  This decision triggered widespread protests and ultimately led to their resignation.
2. The resignation of the Congress Ministries was primarily driven by internal conflicts within the Congress itself, with disagreements over the strategy for future political action. These internal divisions ultimately led to the collapse of the ministries.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Congress Ministries in the provinces did indeed resign en masse in 1939.  This was primarily in response to the Viceroy's decision to declare war on Germany without consulting the elected Congress governments. The Congress vehemently opposed this decision, arguing that India's involvement in the war should be based on the consent of its elected representatives.  This action demonstrated the Congress's growing assertion of its political authority and its opposition to the British government's unilateral actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While internal disagreements existed within the Congress, the primary reason for the resignation of the Congress Ministries in 1939 was the Viceroy's decision to involve India in the Second World War without consultation.  Internal conflicts played a secondary role, and the immediate trigger was the war declaration.  The statement incorrectly emphasizes internal divisions as the primary cause of the resignation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Lahore Congress Session of 1929:**

1.  The session witnessed the formal adoption of Purna Swaraj as the Congress's goal.
2.  The session saw the unanimous election of Jawaharlal Nehru as Congress President, reflecting the consensus on complete independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lahore Congress Session of 1929 is indeed historically significant for the formal declaration of Purna Swaraj (complete independence) as the Congress's primary objective. This marked a crucial shift in the Congress's stance from dominion status to complete self-rule, reflecting the growing assertiveness of the nationalist movement.  This decision was a pivotal moment in the Indian freedom struggle, signaling a decisive break from the previous, more moderate approaches.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Jawaharlal Nehru was indeed elected president at the Lahore session, his election was far from unanimous.  Significant opposition existed within the Congress, with 15 out of 18 Provincial Congress Committees initially opposing his candidature.  Gandhi's backing ultimately secured Nehru's presidency, highlighting the internal power dynamics and the ongoing debate within the Congress regarding strategy and leadership.  The assertion of unanimous support misrepresents the complex political landscape within the Congress at that time.  The question of leadership and strategy was a contentious issue within the Congress, and Nehru's election, while ultimately successful, wasn't a reflection of complete unity on the issue of complete independence.


**2. With reference to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, consider the following statements:**

1.  The pact resulted in the immediate release of all political prisoners, regardless of the nature of their offenses.
2.  The pact secured the complete abolition of the salt tax and the government's salt monopoly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact, while leading to the release of many political prisoners, did *not* secure the release of *all* political prisoners.  The pact specifically stipulated the release of those not convicted of violence.  This exclusion highlights the complexities of the negotiations and the limitations of the agreement in addressing all grievances of the nationalist movement.  The government strategically retained the power to detain individuals convicted of violent acts, thereby maintaining a degree of control over the movement's more radical elements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact did *not* result in the complete abolition of the salt tax or the government's salt monopoly. While the pact did grant the right to make salt in coastal villages for personal consumption (not for sale), this was a far cry from the complete dismantling of the salt tax and the government's monopoly.  This partial concession reflects the limited nature of the concessions the British government was willing to make at the time, while still maintaining significant control over crucial revenue sources. The British government's reluctance to completely relinquish control over the salt tax demonstrates their unwillingness to make significant concessions that would undermine their economic power in India.


**3. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established an All-India Federation that included all British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states.
2. The Act introduced complete provincial autonomy, eliminating dyarchy and granting provinces full financial and legislative independence from the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Government of India Act of 1935 did indeed envision an All-India Federation encompassing British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states. However, it's crucial to note that this federation was never fully realized due to the non-fulfillment of crucial conditions, primarily the lack of sufficient participation from the princely states.  The failure of the federation to materialize highlights the limitations of the Act's design and the underlying power dynamics within the Indian political landscape. The act's failure to fully implement the federal structure underscores the inherent limitations of the British approach to constitutional reform in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act did replace dyarchy with provincial autonomy, it did *not* grant provinces complete financial and legislative independence.  Significant "safeguards" and "special responsibilities" were retained by the Governor, allowing for considerable central government intervention and control, particularly in matters concerning law and order, minorities, and British interests.  The retention of these powers demonstrates the limitations of the autonomy granted and the continued assertion of British control over key aspects of provincial governance. The continued existence of "special responsibilities" for the Governor significantly curtailed the extent of provincial autonomy.


**4. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahatma Gandhi's initial call for the movement included urging government servants to resign from their posts and soldiers to desert their units.
2. The movement saw widespread participation from princely states, with many rulers openly supporting the call for complete independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. On the eve of the Quit India Movement, Mahatma Gandhi's call for action indeed encompassed urging government servants to resign and soldiers to leave their posts. This radical call reflected the heightened intensity of the movement and the determination to challenge British authority at all levels.  This bold strategy aimed at disrupting the administrative and military machinery of the colonial government.  However, it is important to note that the response to this call was varied and not uniformly successful.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Quit India Movement did *not* see widespread participation from the princely states.  In fact, many princely rulers remained largely aloof from the movement, choosing to maintain their allegiance to the British Raj. This lack of support from the princely states underlines the limitations of the movement's reach and its inability to fully unify the diverse political landscape of India.  The princely states' largely passive stance during the Quit India Movement demonstrates the limitations of the movement's influence beyond British India.


**5. Consider the following statements about the debates on the future strategy of the nationalist movement after the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement:**

1.  Jawaharlal Nehru, along with Subhas Chandra Bose and other leftists, strongly opposed the entry of Congress into legislative councils, arguing that it would compromise the movement's revolutionary character.
2.  Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance but eventually relented, allowing for the formation of Congress ministries in several provinces after the 1937 elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, a significant debate arose within the Congress regarding future strategies.  A key point of contention was the question of participation in legislative councils.  Jawaharlal Nehru, along with Subhas Chandra Bose and other left-wing leaders, vehemently opposed such participation, arguing that it would dilute the movement's revolutionary spirit and shift focus away from mass mobilization.  Their perspective emphasized the importance of sustained non-cooperation and direct action against colonial rule.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Gandhi, while initially skeptical of office acceptance, eventually conceded the possibility of forming Congress ministries in provinces where the Congress secured majorities in the 1937 elections.  This decision reflected a pragmatic approach, acknowledging the political opportunity presented while maintaining the Congress's commitment to opposing the 1935 Act and working towards complete independence.  Gandhi's eventual approval of office acceptance demonstrates a degree of strategic flexibility and a recognition of the need to navigate the evolving political landscape. The shift in Gandhi's stance represents a pragmatic adaptation of strategy within the broader context of the freedom struggle.


**6. With reference to the Communal Award of 1932 and the Poona Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Communal Award established separate electorates for various religious and caste groups, including the depressed classes, based on the recommendations of the Simon Commission.
2. The Poona Pact, negotiated between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, abolished separate electorates for the depressed classes but increased their reserved seats in legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Communal Award of 1932, while establishing separate electorates for various groups, including the depressed classes, was *not* based on the recommendations of the Simon Commission. The Simon Commission, in fact, *rejected* the proposal for separate electorates for the depressed classes.  The Communal Award was a direct response to the failure of the Second Round Table Conference to reach a consensus on minority representation, and it was announced by Ramsay MacDonald, not the Simon Commission. The Award's origins highlight the British government's strategy of divide and rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The Poona Pact, a landmark agreement between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, successfully negotiated an end to the separate electorates for the depressed classes.  This resulted from Gandhi's fast unto death, and a compromise was reached which increased the number of reserved seats for the depressed classes, albeit within a joint electorate.  The pact's significance lies in its ability to temporarily resolve a potentially explosive issue, but it also highlights the complex and evolving relationship between Gandhi and Ambedkar, and the limitations of the pact in addressing the deeper social inequalities faced by the depressed classes. The pact's success in resolving the immediate crisis also exposed the limitations of its ability to address the root causes of social inequality.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the activities of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA):**

1.  The HSRA's main objective was to overthrow the colonial government through armed revolution and establish a socialist federal republic based on adult franchise.
2.  The assassination of John P. Saunders was a planned act of the HSRA, specifically targeting the Superintendent of Police James Scott to avenge Lala Lajpat Rai's death.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), which evolved from the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), had as its primary goal the overthrow of British rule through armed revolution.  They aimed to replace the colonial government with a socialist federal republic based on the principle of adult franchise. This objective reflected the influence of socialist and communist ideologies on the revolutionary movement. The HSRA's commitment to a socialist republic is a crucial aspect of understanding their revolutionary ideology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the assassination of John P. Saunders was undertaken by HSRA members, it was *not* a planned act targeting James Scott specifically. The assassination resulted from a mistaken identity; Saunders was killed instead of Scott, who had been responsible for the lathi charge on Lala Lajpat Rai.  While the act was intended as a form of protest and retaliation, the mistaken identity highlights the impulsive nature of the act and the limitations of such actions in achieving broader political goals.  The accidental nature of the killing underscores the limitations of violent actions as a means of achieving political objectives.


**8. With reference to the Cripps Mission's proposals, consider the following statements:**

1.  The mission proposed a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution for India, with members being entirely elected by provincial assemblies.
2.  The mission explicitly offered complete independence to India after the war, subject only to the condition that provinces could opt for secession.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission's proposals for a constituent assembly did *not* provide for the entirely elected membership from provincial assemblies.  The assembly's composition would have included members nominated by the princely states.  This feature reflected the British government's attempt to balance the interests of the princely states within the proposed constitutional framework. The inclusion of nominated members from princely states demonstrates the limitations of the proposed constitutional reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did *not* explicitly offer complete independence to India after the war.  The offer was for dominion status within the Commonwealth, with the option for India to later withdraw.  This provision, coupled with the right of provinces to opt for secession, ultimately proved to be a major point of contention and a significant factor in the mission's failure. The offer of dominion status, rather than complete independence, was a key factor in the rejection of the Cripps proposals.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Forward Bloc:**

1.  The Forward Bloc was founded by Subhas Chandra Bose in 1939 after his resignation from the Congress presidency.
2.  The Forward Bloc advocated for a non-violent approach to achieving Indian independence, differing significantly from Subhas Bose's earlier stance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Forward Bloc was indeed founded by Subhas Chandra Bose in 1939 following his resignation from the Congress presidency after the Tripuri session.  The formation of the Forward Bloc marked a significant development in the Indian political landscape, reflecting the growing ideological divisions within the nationalist movement.  The bloc represented a more radical and assertive approach to the struggle for independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Forward Bloc, while initially operating within the framework of the Congress, did *not* advocate for a non-violent approach to achieving independence.  In fact, Subhas Chandra Bose's ideology, even before the formation of the Forward Bloc, leaned towards a more militant and, if necessary, violent approach to achieving freedom.  The Forward Bloc's stance was consistent with Bose's earlier views, emphasizing a stronger and more assertive challenge to British rule. The Bloc's ideology reflects Bose's belief in the necessity of a more assertive, even violent, approach to achieving independence.


**10. With reference to the views of Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both Gandhi and Bose supported socialism as the ideal economic model for independent India, although they differed on the methods of achieving it.
2.  Gandhi strongly advocated for the complete separation of religion and the state, while Bose favored a state that would remain neutral in religious matters.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose expressed support for a socialist economic framework for independent India. However, their approaches differed significantly.  Gandhi envisioned a decentralized, village-based economy emphasizing self-sufficiency and traditional crafts, while Bose advocated for rapid industrialization and state-led economic planning, drawing inspiration from the Soviet model.  Their differing perspectives reflect their contrasting visions for India's future development.  The convergence on socialism, despite differing implementation methods, highlights a common thread in their socio-economic thought.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bose advocated for a secular state that would remain neutral in religious matters, Gandhi's position was more nuanced.  Gandhi, while deeply religious himself, championed religious tolerance and opposed religious discrimination but didn't advocate for a complete separation of religion and the state. His concept of Ramrajya, while envisioning a society free from exploitation, didn't necessarily preclude the influence of religious principles in public life.  Gandhi's view on the role of religion in public life differs substantially from a complete separation of religion and the state.

**1. With reference to Jawaharlal Nehru's role in India's freedom struggle and post-independence era, consider the following statements:**

1. Nehru, while a key figure in the drafting of the Indian Constitution, initially favored a socialist model diverging from the ultimately adopted document.
2.  Nehru's foreign policy, significantly shaped by his vision of non-alignment, prioritized maintaining amicable relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Jawaharlal Nehru was instrumental in the drafting and adoption of the Indian Constitution, holding a dominant position in the Constituent Assembly. However, his socialist leanings and vision for a more socialist India are well documented. His initial ideas for the economic and social structure of independent India differed from the ultimately adopted mixed economy model. While the Constitution incorporated elements of social justice and welfare, it didn't fully embrace the socialist principles Nehru advocated.  His socialist ideas influenced the direction of post-independence India's policies, but the Constitution itself reflected a more pragmatic and less radically socialist approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nehru's Non-Aligned Movement aimed at maintaining equidistance from both the US and USSR,  the reality was far more nuanced.  His foreign policy, while officially non-aligned, leaned more towards the Soviet Union during certain periods, particularly due to shared anti-colonial sentiments and ideological affinities.  The relationship with the US was often strained due to differing geopolitical perspectives and the Cold War context. Therefore,  it's inaccurate to say that his foreign policy prioritized equally amicable relations with both superpowers. His policy aimed at neutrality, but the balance was not always equal.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA) and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The INA's military campaign, though ultimately unsuccessful, significantly boosted Indian morale and contributed to the growing demand for independence.
2. Subhas Chandra Bose's leadership of the INA was universally praised within India, even by those who disagreed with his methods, solidifying his legacy as a national hero.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The INA's military campaign, though ultimately defeated with the collapse of Japan in World War II, played a crucial role in the Indian independence movement.  The trials of INA officers, like Shah Nawaz Khan, Gurbachan Singh Dhillon, and Prem Kumar Sehgal, became a rallying point for the Indian populace. The widespread public support for the INA demonstrated the depth of nationalist sentiment and the growing desire for self-rule. The movement against the trials galvanized public opinion and put further pressure on the British government.  The INA's activities, even in defeat, significantly contributed to the weakening of British authority and the strengthening of the independence movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Subhas Chandra Bose's leadership of the INA greatly enhanced his stature as a national hero amongst many, his collaboration with Axis powers during World War II was a controversial aspect of his legacy.  Many within the Indian National Congress, including prominent leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, strongly criticized his alliance with Fascist and militaristic regimes.  Therefore, his leadership of the INA was not universally praised within India, with significant opposition stemming from his chosen alliances. Although he was hailed as Netaji, his methods were criticized by many.


**3. With reference to the partition of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Radcliffe Line, drawn hastily and with limited information, resulted in significant displacement and communal violence, particularly in Punjab and Bengal.
2.  The Delhi Pact, signed by Jawaharlal Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan, completely resolved the refugee crisis and ensured lasting communal harmony between India and Pakistan.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Radcliffe Line, the boundary demarcation between India and Pakistan, was drawn under immense time pressure and with insufficient knowledge of the local geography, demography, and administrative units. This led to significant problems, including the division of communities, families, and agricultural lands. The hasty demarcation and the resulting uncertainties fueled widespread communal violence, particularly in Punjab and Bengal, resulting in immense human suffering, displacement, and loss of life.  The process was deeply flawed and contributed significantly to the post-partition chaos.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Delhi Pact (Nehru-Liaquat Pact) aimed at mitigating the refugee crisis and promoting communal harmony between India and Pakistan, particularly in the Bengal region. While it did make some provisions for the protection of minorities and the resettlement of refugees, it failed to fully resolve the crisis. The refugee problem persisted for years, and communal tensions continued to plague relations between the two nations. The Pact represented an attempt at reconciliation, but it did not achieve a lasting solution to the complex issues arising from partition.  The refugee issue was far more complex than the pact could address.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Government of India Act of 1935:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier system of dyarchy, and significantly increased the powers of provincial legislatures.
2.  The Act successfully established the envisioned All-India Federation, bringing together British Indian provinces and princely states under a unified federal structure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 was a landmark piece of legislation that introduced significant constitutional changes in British India.  A key feature was the introduction of provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier diarchy system (dual governance) which divided powers between the Governor and elected ministers. The Act granted provinces greater legislative and administrative powers, enhancing their self-governance. Provincial legislatures gained substantially more control over provincial affairs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act did envision the creation of an All-India Federation, incorporating both British Indian provinces and the princely states.  However, this crucial aspect of the Act never materialized due to the failure to meet the conditions set for the princely states' participation. The princely states did not meet the required criteria for joining the federation, and the proposed federal structure remained unimplemented. The central government continued to operate under the provisions of the 1919 Act until the arrival of the 1947 Independence Act. The failure to establish the federation was a critical shortcoming.


**5. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement was launched immediately after the failure of the Cripps Mission, reflecting widespread disillusionment with British promises of self-governance.
2. The movement was characterized solely by non-violent methods, upholding Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha throughout its duration.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quit India Movement, launched in August 1942, followed the failure of the Cripps Mission. The mission's inadequate proposals and the British government's continued reluctance to grant substantial power to Indians fueled widespread anger and frustration. This led to the mass civil disobedience movement demanding an immediate end to British rule in India.  The failure of the Cripps mission acted as a catalyst for the movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Quit India Movement was initially conceived as a non-violent mass movement, in line with Gandhi's principles of Satyagraha, the widespread arrests of Congress leaders led to spontaneous and widespread protests across the country. The movement, while largely non-violent in its initial intentions, witnessed instances of violence in some areas as a consequence of the government's harsh suppression of protests. The lack of leadership and organization in certain areas contributed to the outbreak of violence. The movement's outcome deviated from the solely non-violent approach envisioned by Gandhi.

**1. With reference to the Cripps Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cripps proposals explicitly guaranteed complete independence to India immediately upon the conclusion of World War II.
2.  The mission's plan for a Constituent Assembly included provisions for the representation of princely states through nomination rather than direct election.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cripps Mission did *not* offer complete independence immediately.  It proposed a Dominion status for India after the war,  with the option for provinces to opt out and negotiate separate agreements with Britain. This ambiguity and the lack of immediate independence were major points of contention that led to the rejection of the proposals. The offer of Dominion status, falling short of complete independence, was a key reason for the Congress's rejection.  The mission aimed to secure Indian cooperation in the war effort, but its conditional offer of self-governance after the war failed to satisfy the Indian National Congress's demand for immediate independence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Cripps proposals outlined a plan for a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution for India. However, the representation of princely states was to be through nomination, not direct election, a crucial difference that highlights the complexities of the political landscape at the time and the limited power transfer the British were willing to concede. The nominated representation of princely states within the Constituent Assembly reflected the British desire to maintain a degree of control over these powerful entities, even within the framework of a self-governing India.  This aspect of the plan further contributed to its ultimate failure.


**2. With reference to the Rajagopalachari Formula, consider the following statements:**

1. The formula proposed a plebiscite in Muslim-majority areas to determine their future status, ensuring a united India while respecting Muslim concerns.
2.  Jinnah's acceptance of the Rajagopalachari Formula was instrumental in averting the partition of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Rajagopalachari Formula aimed to prevent partition, it did not propose a plebiscite in Muslim-majority areas. Instead, it suggested a standstill agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League, where Muslim-majority areas would initially remain within a united India, but with significant autonomy.  This option, while intended as a compromise, ultimately failed to address the core issue of the Two-Nation Theory and the Muslim League's demand for a separate state.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Jinnah categorically rejected the Rajagopalachari Formula.  His rejection, coupled with the Congress's inability to fully embrace the formula's compromises, effectively sealed the fate of a unified India. The failure of this last-ditch attempt at a negotiated settlement solidified the trajectory towards the partition of India.  The rejection highlights the deep chasm between the two major political forces and the failure of conciliatory efforts to bridge the divide.


**3. With reference to the Cabinet Mission Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet Mission Plan proposed a three-tier structure of governance for India, including a federal government, provincial governments, and regional groups.
2. The plan explicitly endorsed the Muslim League's demand for a separate Pakistan.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cabinet Mission Plan proposed a complex three-tier structure for India's future governance. This involved a Union government responsible for defense, foreign affairs, and communications; autonomous provincial governments; and the option for grouping of provinces based on geographical proximity and shared interests.  This intricate arrangement was an attempt to accommodate both the Congress's vision for a unified India and the Muslim League's desire for greater autonomy in Muslim-majority areas. The three-tier structure aimed to balance power-sharing and autonomy, but its complexity ultimately contributed to its failure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cabinet Mission Plan did *not* endorse the creation of Pakistan as a separate independent state. It proposed a loose federation with a weak center, aiming to achieve a united India.  However, the plan's allowance for regional groupings was misinterpreted by the Muslim League as a step towards Pakistan, leading to further political turmoil.  The lack of explicit support for a separate Pakistan, coupled with the plan's complex structure, laid the groundwork for its eventual collapse and the continued pursuit of partition by the Muslim League.


**4. With reference to the Wavell Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Wavell Plan was primarily aimed at establishing a fully independent Indian government immediately after its proposal.
2. The plan's proposal for an expanded Executive Council included representation from both the Congress and the Muslim League.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Wavell Plan, proposed in 1945, did *not* aim for immediate independence. It aimed to expand the Viceroy's Executive Council to include more Indian representatives, with the goal of fostering greater cooperation between the Congress and the Muslim League in the governance of India. It was a step towards greater Indian participation in the government, but it fell short of granting full independence. The plan's emphasis on increased Indian participation in the existing governmental structure, rather than a complete transfer of power, reflected the British government's reluctance to relinquish control.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the Wavell Plan was its proposal to expand the Viceroy's Executive Council, bringing in members from both the Congress and the Muslim League.  This was an attempt to bridge the political divide and establish a more representative government.  However, the plan's failure to address the core issue of the demand for Pakistan led to its ultimate failure and the escalation of tensions between the two major political parties. The inclusion of both Congress and Muslim League representatives aimed at promoting cooperation and a more inclusive approach to governance, but this effort failed to achieve its intended outcome due to the deep-seated political differences.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Quit India Movement:**

1. The Quit India Resolution was passed by the All India Congress Committee in Calcutta in August 1942.
2.  The movement was characterized solely by non-violent methods throughout its duration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Quit India Resolution was passed in Bombay, not Calcutta, in August 1942. This seemingly minor detail highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC examinations. The location of the AICC meeting where the resolution was passed is a specific detail that distinguishes a thorough understanding from a superficial one.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Quit India Movement was initially conceived as a non-violent mass movement, the widespread arrests of Congress leaders led to spontaneous outbursts of violence in various parts of the country.  The movement, while initiated with non-violent intentions, saw significant instances of violence and unrest, particularly in response to the government's repressive measures. The spontaneous nature of the violence following the arrests of Congress leaders underscores the limitations of solely relying on non-violent methods in the face of severe state repression.  The movement's evolution from planned non-violence to widespread spontaneous acts of resistance demonstrates the complex dynamics of a mass movement under colonial rule.


**6. With reference to the Indian National Army (INA), consider the following statements:**

1. The INA was primarily formed and led by Subhas Chandra Bose during World War II with the support of the Allied powers.
2.  The trials of INA officers after World War II significantly boosted the morale of the Indian people and strengthened the demand for independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The INA was formed with the support of the Axis powers (primarily Japan), not the Allied powers.  Subhas Chandra Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II remains a controversial aspect of Indian history. The INA’s association with the Axis powers, rather than the Allies, significantly impacted its reception within India and the broader international context.  This detail highlights the complexities of the war and its influence on the Indian independence movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The trials of INA officers after the war, despite their initial convictions, had a galvanizing effect on the Indian public.  The widespread support for the INA officers, seen as national heroes, significantly boosted the morale of the Indian people and further strengthened the demand for independence. The trials of the INA officers became a focal point for the growing nationalist sentiment, transforming the perception of the INA from a collaborationist force into symbols of national resistance. The public outcry in support of the INA officers forced the British to reconsider their strategy and approach to the Indian independence movement.


**7.  With reference to the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms introduced separate electorates for Muslims, leading to the communalization of Indian politics.
2. The reforms significantly expanded the franchise, granting voting rights to a substantial portion of the Indian population.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 introduced separate electorates for Muslims, a significant step towards the communalization of Indian politics. This policy, intended to appease Muslim concerns, inadvertently exacerbated communal tensions and contributed to the growth of separate Muslim political identity.  The introduction of separate electorates had long-lasting consequences, shaping the political landscape and contributing to the eventual partition of India.  The policy's impact on the trajectory of Indian politics remains a key area of study.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Morley-Minto Reforms did *not* significantly expand the franchise.  The expansion was limited, primarily benefiting the landed gentry and wealthy Indians. The limited nature of the franchise expansion highlights the constraints placed on Indian political participation under British rule and the limited nature of the reforms. The reforms primarily aimed at co-opting some elements of the nationalist movement, rather than promoting widespread political participation.


**8. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Non-Cooperation Movement was launched immediately after the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
2. The movement involved a complete boycott of British institutions, including schools, colleges, and courts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement was launched in 1920, not immediately after the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919). The timing of the movement is a key detail that distinguishes a comprehensive understanding from a superficial one. While the massacre certainly fueled nationalist sentiment, the movement was launched a year later, suggesting a more calculated strategy rather than an immediate reaction.

Statement 2 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement involved a wide-ranging boycott of British institutions, including schools, colleges, courts, and government services.  This aspect of the movement reflects Gandhi's strategy of mass civil resistance and his attempt to mobilize the Indian population against British rule.  The boycott of British institutions was a central element of the Non-Cooperation Movement, demonstrating Gandhi's approach to non-violent civil disobedience.  The breadth and scope of the boycott underscore the movement's ambition and its impact on the colonial administration.


**9. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a federal structure with a strong central government, significantly reducing the powers of provincial governments.
2. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance to the provinces.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced a federal structure, but it did *not* establish a strong central government. The Act aimed to create a balance of power between the center and provinces, but the central government's powers were still significantly limited. The Act's federal structure aimed to create a balance between the central and provincial governments, but the actual distribution of power proved to be a source of contention and contributed to its ultimate failure. The Act did not effectively resolve the issue of power-sharing between the center and provinces, highlighting the complexities of establishing a federal structure in a diverse and politically charged environment.

Statement 2 is correct. A major feature of the 1935 Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy. This granted significant self-governance to the provinces, allowing them to manage their own affairs with a greater degree of independence.  Provincial autonomy was a significant step towards self-governance, but it was also accompanied by various safeguards and reservations of power by the British government. The Act's provisions for provincial autonomy aimed to create a degree of self-governance in the provinces while still maintaining overall British control.  However, the implementation of provincial autonomy also resulted in new challenges and conflicts between the central and provincial governments.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the 1857 Revolt:**

1. The revolt was primarily triggered by the introduction of the Enfield rifle, whose cartridges were rumored to be greased with animal fat.
2. The revolt was characterized by widespread and unified participation from all sections of Indian society, leading to a coordinated national uprising.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The immediate trigger for the 1857 Revolt was the introduction of the Enfield rifle, whose cartridges were rumored to be greased with animal fat, offending both Hindu and Muslim religious sensibilities. This sparked widespread discontent among sepoys, which quickly escalated into a larger rebellion. While the greased cartridges were the immediate trigger, the revolt was fueled by deeper underlying grievances related to economic exploitation, political subjugation, and cultural insensitivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1857 Revolt was not characterized by widespread and unified participation from all sections of Indian society. While it involved significant participation from sepoys, many sections of society remained either neutral or opposed to the uprising.  The revolt lacked a unified national leadership and a cohesive national vision, resulting in localized and often uncoordinated uprisings across different regions. The lack of complete societal unity highlighted the challenges of mobilizing diverse groups under a common cause during the revolt, indicating the limitations of the rebellion in terms of its scope and objectives.

**1. With reference to the debates on the future strategy of the nationalist movement after the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, and Bhulabhai Desai advocated for a solely Gandhian approach of constructive work, rejecting any engagement with constitutional politics.
2. Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a leftist faction, strongly opposed both constructive work and council entry, advocating for the immediate resumption of mass non-constitutional struggle.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While constructive work was a part of Gandhi's vision, Ansari, Ali, and Desai, among others,  were a significant group who advocated for *constitutional struggle* and participation in elections to the Central Legislature and provincial councils. They believed this engagement, even in a period of political apathy, could maintain political interest and morale, provide a platform for Congress growth, and offer a counterpoint to the suspended civil disobedience movement.  They did not reject constitutional politics entirely; their participation was strategic.

Statement 2 is correct. Jawaharlal Nehru, representing a strong leftist trend within the Congress, was indeed critical of both Gandhian constructive work and council entry as substitutes for mass civil disobedience. He viewed these as diverting attention from the core anti-colonial struggle.  Nehru strongly favoured the resumption and continuation of non-constitutional mass struggle, believing the situation remained revolutionary due to ongoing economic crisis and the masses' willingness to fight. He saw council entry as a "spiritual defeat" and a retreat from revolutionary ideals.


**2. With reference to the Government of India Act, 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act established a fully functional All-India Federation comprising all British Indian provinces, chief commissioner's provinces, and Indian states, immediately upon its enactment.
2.  The Act introduced provincial autonomy, replacing dyarchy, and granted provinces significant financial independence, allowing them to borrow money on their own security.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Government of India Act, 1935, *did* propose an All-India Federation, but its formation was contingent upon several conditions, including the accession of Indian states representing 50% of the total Indian state population and their allocation of 52 seats in the proposed Council of States. These conditions were not met, and the federation never materialized. The central government continued to operate under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1919, until 1946.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the 1935 Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy, replacing the earlier dyarchical system. This granted provinces considerable self-governance, including significant financial powers. Provinces were given independent financial resources and the ability to borrow money on their own security, marking a substantial shift towards greater provincial autonomy.


**3. With reference to the debates surrounding office acceptance within the Congress in 1937, consider the following statements:**

1.  Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru, along with Congress socialists and communists, unequivocally supported office acceptance, viewing it as a strategic tool to dismantle the 1935 Act from within.
2. Gandhi initially opposed office acceptance but later, by early 1936, shifted his stance and expressed willingness to give it a trial, accepting it as a means to promote constructive work even under limited powers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nehru, Bose, Congress socialists, and communists were *strongly opposed* to office acceptance in the 1937 elections. They argued that accepting office under the 1935 Act would contradict the nationalists' rejection of the Act and compromise the revolutionary character of the movement. They believed that constitutional work would distract from the primary goals of freedom, economic and social justice, and poverty alleviation. While some leftists proposed using council entry to create deadlocks, their overall stance was against actively participating in the government formed under the 1935 Act.

Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi initially voiced reservations about office acceptance in Congress Working Committee (CWC) meetings. However, by early 1936, he shifted his position and indicated a willingness to consider forming Congress ministries as a practical strategy.  While maintaining his fundamental disagreement with the 1935 Act, he acknowledged that Congressmen who couldn't participate in Satyagraha or constructive work could channel their patriotic energies through council work, provided they didn't become entangled in constitutionalism or self-serving politics.  He saw it as a temporary tactical move, not a compromise on the larger goal of independence.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Mountbatten Plan of June 3, 1947:**

1. The plan mandated the immediate creation of two independent dominions, India and Pakistan, regardless of the outcome of referendums or votes in the affected provinces.
2.  The plan included provisions for referendums in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Sylhet district of Bengal to determine their accession to either India or Pakistan.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mountbatten Plan did *not* mandate the immediate creation of two independent dominions irrespective of provincial decisions.  The plan proposed that the Punjab and Bengal Legislative Assemblies would be divided into Hindu and Muslim groups to vote on partition.  Only if a simple majority in either group voted for partition would these provinces be divided.  The creation of two dominions was conditional upon these votes and the decisions in Sindh, NWFP, and Sylhet.  The plan aimed to minimize partition, not impose it unconditionally.

Statement 2 is correct. A crucial element of the Mountbatten Plan was the inclusion of referendums in the NWFP and Sylhet district of Bengal. These referendums were designed to allow the populations of these areas to express their preference for joining either India or Pakistan, ensuring a degree of self-determination in the partition process.  The results of these referendums directly impacted the final boundaries of the two new dominions.


**5. With reference to the Indian Independence Act, 1947, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act dissolved the existing Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States immediately upon its enactment, establishing the new dominions' legislative powers exclusively within their respective Constituent Assemblies.
2. The Act stipulated that, until new constitutions were adopted by India and Pakistan, the governments of both dominions would operate under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, effectively dissolved the existing Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States.  The Act vested the legislative powers of the new dominions in their respective Constituent Assemblies, ensuring a smooth transition to self-governance.  This was a pivotal step in the transfer of power, shifting legislative authority from the colonial structure to the newly formed independent bodies.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Recognizing the need for a transitional period, the Act provided that until each dominion adopted its own constitution, the existing administrative framework and governmental structure would operate under the Government of India Act, 1935. This ensured some continuity in governance during the transition to independence, minimizing potential disruptions.  This temporary measure allowed for the establishment of the new dominions’ governmental structures while maintaining a functional administrative system.


**6. With reference to the reasons for the Congress' acceptance of partition, consider the following statements:**

1. The Congress leadership believed that partition was a temporary measure, anticipating that Hindu-Muslim differences would be resolved quickly once British rule ended, leading to a unified India.
2.  A primary factor influencing Congress' decision was the urgent need to prevent the further escalation of widespread communal violence and the imminent collapse of the Interim Government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, although it reflects a degree of wishful thinking.  Some within the Congress leadership, particularly Nehru, held onto the belief that partition was a temporary solution and that once the immediate crisis subsided, the differences between Hindus and Muslims could be resolved, leading to a unified India.  This belief, however, proved to be inaccurate, highlighting a misjudgment of the depth and intensity of communal divisions.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The severity and scale of communal violence, coupled with the near-collapse of the Interim Government, played a significant role in the Congress' decision to accept partition.  The potential for even greater bloodshed and chaos if partition wasn't accepted made it a difficult but pragmatic choice.  The leadership recognized that an immediate transfer of power, even through partition, was necessary to contain the escalating violence and prevent complete societal breakdown.  The urgency of the situation outweighed other considerations.


**7.  Consider the following statements concerning the post-war national scenario in India:**

1. The Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt of February 1946 was primarily driven by issues of racial discrimination, poor food quality, and harsh treatment by superior officers, with the demand for Indian independence playing a secondary role.
2. The INA trials and the subsequent agitation significantly impacted the morale of the British armed forces, raising concerns about their loyalty and reliability in maintaining British authority in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the RIN revolt certainly expressed broader anti-imperialist sentiments and solidarity with the INA, its immediate triggers were primarily internal issues within the navy itself.  Racial discrimination (unequal pay compared to British sailors), poor food quality, and abusive treatment by superior officers were significant factors that ignited the mutiny.  The demand for independence was intertwined with these grievances, but the immediate concerns were within the naval context.

Statement 2 is also correct. The widespread agitation surrounding the INA trials had a profound effect on the morale of the British armed forces in India.  The support for the INA prisoners from various sections of Indian society, including within the army itself, demonstrated a weakening of loyalty to the British Crown.  The British authorities recognized the potential for further unrest and the risk of widespread disaffection within the armed forces, adding pressure to expedite the process of transferring power.  This factor significantly influenced the British government's decision-making.


**8. With reference to the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, consider the following statements:**

1. The plan proposed a three-tiered structure of governance, with executive and legislative bodies at the provincial, sectional, and union levels, with the Union controlling subjects like defence and external affairs.
2.  The plan explicitly rejected the demand for a separate Pakistan, primarily due to concerns about the large non-Muslim populations within the proposed Pakistani territories and the potential for widespread communal violence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key element of the Cabinet Mission Plan was the proposal for a three-tiered structure of governance for India.  This involved establishing executive and legislative bodies at the provincial, sectional (grouping of provinces), and union levels.  The union government would have control over key areas such as defence, external affairs, and communications, while provinces would retain significant autonomy.  This federal structure was intended to accommodate the diverse interests within India while maintaining a unified framework.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Cabinet Mission explicitly rejected the demand for a fully independent Pakistan.  The primary reasons for this rejection were the significant non-Muslim populations in the proposed territories, the potential for widespread communal conflict if provinces were forcibly partitioned, and the disruption of existing regional ties.  The Mission sought to avoid the creation of a state that would inevitably trigger major unrest and instability.


**9. With reference to the evolution of the two-nation theory, consider the following statements:**

1. The demand for separate electorates for Muslims, initially articulated around 1906, was primarily a response to concerns about the underrepresentation of Muslim interests within the existing political system.
2. The Pakistan Resolution of 1940, passed at the Lahore session of the Muslim League, called for the creation of a single, unified independent state encompassing all geographically contiguous Muslim-majority areas in India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The demand for separate electorates for Muslims, prominently voiced around 1906 through the Shimla delegation led by Agha Khan, stemmed from concerns about the inadequate representation of Muslim interests within the existing political structures dominated by Hindu majority.  Muslims felt that their specific concerns and needs were not being adequately addressed within the existing system, leading to demands for separate representation to ensure their voice was heard.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Pakistan Resolution of 1940 did *not* call for a single, unified independent state encompassing all Muslim-majority areas.  The resolution advocated for the creation of "independent states" in geographically contiguous Muslim-majority areas in the north-west and north-east of India, which implies multiple states, not a single entity.  This ambiguity in the resolution's wording contributed to later interpretations and debates about the nature of the proposed Pakistani state.

**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's initial success stemmed largely from widespread participation across various social strata, including peasants, workers, and students, who actively boycotted British institutions and goods.
2.  Despite initial Hindu-Muslim unity, the movement's later stages witnessed increased communal tension, exemplified by incidents like the Moplah Rebellion, ultimately contributing to its decline.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, initially enjoyed significant success due to widespread participation from diverse social groups.  Peasants, workers, and students actively boycotted British goods, educational institutions, and government services.  This broad-based support demonstrated a growing national consciousness and a rejection of colonial rule.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this initial phase of the movement.

However, the movement's later stages were marred by growing communal tensions. The Moplah Rebellion in Malabar, though not directly orchestrated by the Congress, highlighted the fragility of Hindu-Muslim unity within the movement.  This, coupled with other factors like the Chauri Chaura incident, led to Gandhi's decision to withdraw the movement in 1922.  The increased communal strife and its role in undermining the movement's momentum support the accuracy of statement 2. Therefore, both statements are correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of the movement, both its initial success and its eventual decline due to internal conflicts and escalating communal tensions.


**2. With reference to the Nehru Report, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nehru Report, drafted in 1928, explicitly advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) as the ultimate goal of the Indian National Congress.
2.  The report's proposals regarding communal representation, particularly the rejection of separate electorates, were a major point of contention and ultimately led to its rejection by the Muslim League.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Nehru Report was a significant step towards greater self-governance, it did *not* advocate for complete independence (Purna Swaraj).  It proposed Dominion Status within the British Commonwealth as the immediate goal. The demand for Purna Swaraj emerged later, notably at the Lahore Congress session in 1929.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Nehru Report's rejection of separate electorates for Muslims was a major point of disagreement with the Muslim League, which strongly advocated for such representation.  This fundamental difference in opinion on communal representation proved insurmountable, leading to the Muslim League's rejection of the report and furthering the growing divide between the Congress and the League.  The other options are therefore incorrect because they either incorrectly attribute complete independence to the Nehru Report or ignore the crucial role of communal representation in its ultimate failure to achieve consensus.


**3. With reference to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, consider the following statements:**

1.  The pact, signed in 1931, led to the immediate release of all political prisoners, including those involved in the Civil Disobedience Movement.
2.  The agreement secured significant concessions from the British government, including the right to manufacture salt and the lifting of certain repressive ordinances.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Gandhi-Irwin Pact did lead to the release of many political prisoners, it did *not* result in the immediate release of *all* prisoners involved in the Civil Disobedience Movement. The release of prisoners was a phased process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact secured crucial concessions from the British, including the lifting of certain repressive ordinances and the crucial right to manufacture salt, a pivotal issue in the Civil Disobedience Movement.  This represented a significant step towards political negotiation and compromise, though it did not fully address all Indian demands.  The other options are incorrect because they either overstate the immediate release of all political prisoners or fail to recognize the significant concessions obtained regarding salt production and the easing of repressive measures.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Poona Pact:**

1.  The Poona Pact, signed in 1932, resulted in the complete abolition of separate electorates for the depressed classes, replacing them with a system of reserved seats within joint electorates.
2.  The agreement, negotiated primarily between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, effectively resolved the communal tensions surrounding the Communal Award.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Poona Pact.  Statement 1 correctly states that the pact replaced the separate electorates for the depressed classes (Dalits), as proposed in the Communal Award, with a system of reserved seats within joint electorates. This was a significant compromise, though it remained a contentious issue.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Poona Pact, negotiated primarily between Gandhi and Ambedkar, successfully resolved the immediate crisis created by the Communal Award, which had sparked widespread protests and opposition from various groups. While the underlying issues of caste discrimination persisted, the pact provided a temporary solution to the immediate political impasse. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the nature of the electoral reforms or overlook the pact's role in resolving the crisis surrounding the Communal Award.


**5. With reference to the Cabinet Mission Plan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The plan proposed a unified India with a strong central government and autonomous provinces, but allowed for the possibility of future secession by provinces.
2.  The Muslim League initially accepted the plan but later withdrew its acceptance, primarily due to the Congress's interpretation of the plan's provisions regarding grouping of provinces.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Cabinet Mission Plan, proposed in 1946, aimed at a unified India with a strong central government and autonomous provinces. However, a crucial element of the plan was the provision for grouping of provinces, which allowed for a degree of regional autonomy and potentially paved the way for future adjustments, including secession.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.


The Muslim League initially accepted the plan, seeing it as a potential pathway to a separate Muslim state. However, the Congress's interpretation of the grouping of provinces, particularly the issue of whether it was compulsory or optional, led to the Muslim League's withdrawal of its support for the plan. This ultimately contributed to the partition of India.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  The other options are incorrect as they fail to accurately reflect the nuances of the Cabinet Mission Plan and the reasons for the Muslim League's eventual rejection of it.  The plan's inherent ambiguities regarding the grouping of provinces and the differing interpretations by the Congress and the Muslim League are key to understanding its failure.

**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's initial success was significantly boosted by the widespread participation of Indian Muslims, fueled by the Khilafat issue.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, directly led Gandhi to suspend the movement, despite significant support from prominent Congress leaders like Motilal Nehru and C.R. Das.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Non-Cooperation Movement gained considerable momentum due to the widespread participation of Indian Muslims.  Their involvement stemmed from the Khilafat issue, which concerned the post-World War I treatment of the Ottoman Caliphate by the Allied powers. This resonated deeply with Indian Muslims, creating a powerful unifying force alongside the broader anti-colonial sentiments of the movement. The shared cause fostered Hindu-Muslim unity, a crucial factor in the movement's initial success.  This unity was exemplified by events like Swami Shradhanand preaching at the Jama Masjid and Dr. Kitchlew being given the keys to the Golden Temple, demonstrating a level of inter-religious cooperation unprecedented in the context of the Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, a violent clash between protestors and police in which policemen were killed, was the immediate trigger for Gandhi's decision to call off the Non-Cooperation Movement.  While many prominent Congress leaders, including Motilal Nehru and C.R. Das, expressed their disapproval of this decision,  Gandhi's primary concern was the escalating violence and the potential for the movement to be brutally suppressed by the British authorities. He believed that the movement's non-violent nature was paramount to its success and that the Chauri Chaura incident demonstrated a failure to adhere to this principle.  The suspension, therefore, was a strategic decision aimed at preserving the movement's integrity and preventing further bloodshed.


**2. With reference to the Salt Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Salt Satyagraha primarily targeted the rural poor, aiming to alleviate their economic burden through the defiance of the salt tax.
2. The movement's success was solely dependent on Gandhi's leadership, with minimal participation from other prominent nationalist leaders.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Salt Satyagraha, though a nationwide movement, specifically targeted the rural poor who were disproportionately affected by the salt tax imposed by the British. The tax was a significant burden on their already meager incomes, and the act of defying the tax was directly aimed at addressing this economic inequality.  The symbolic nature of salt as a basic necessity further amplified the movement's impact, resonating with the masses and highlighting the exploitative nature of British rule.  The widespread participation in salt manufacturing and the defiance of the salt laws demonstrated a direct challenge to the economic policies of the colonial government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi was the undeniable leader and driving force behind the Salt Satyagraha, the movement involved significant participation from other prominent nationalist leaders and a wide spectrum of Indian society.  The movement's success depended not only on Gandhi's charisma and leadership but also on the collective effort and sacrifice of countless individuals who actively participated in the various aspects of the Satyagraha, from the Dandi March to the numerous acts of civil disobedience across the country.  The movement’s widespread reach and impact underscore the collaborative nature of the struggle for independence.


**3. With reference to the Rowlatt Act, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rowlatt Act was passed by the British Parliament without any opposition from Indian members of the Imperial Legislative Council.
2. The act's provisions were a direct extension of the Defence of India Regulations Act, 1915, aiming to curb dissent during wartime.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rowlatt Act faced significant opposition from Indian members of the Imperial Legislative Council. Although the Act was ultimately passed by the council,  the Indian members vehemently protested against its draconian provisions which allowed for detention without trial and severely curtailed civil liberties.  This opposition, though ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the Act's passage, highlighted the growing discontent among Indians and the rising tide of nationalism. The act's passage without meaningful Indian consent served as a major catalyst for future protests and movements, including the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rowlatt Act was indeed a direct extension of the Defence of India Regulations Act, 1915, enacted during World War I.  While the Defence of India Act was initially justified as a measure to maintain order during wartime, the Rowlatt Act perpetuated many of its repressive provisions even after the war's conclusion.  This demonstrated a clear intention by the British to maintain control over India through authoritarian measures, even in the absence of an immediate war threat.  The continued use of such emergency powers underscored the colonial government's disregard for basic Indian rights and fueled nationalist resentment.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The INA trials attracted widespread international attention and garnered support for the accused from prominent figures like Albert Einstein, H.G. Wells, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
2. The Meerut Conspiracy Case involved primarily trade unionists and communists accused of plotting against the British government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The trials of the Indian National Army (INA) officers, notably  Prem Kumar Sehgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon, and Shah Nawaz Khan, generated significant international attention, attracting condemnation from prominent individuals such as Albert Einstein, H.G. Wells, Harold Laski, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. These figures voiced their support for the accused, highlighting the injustice of the trials and bringing global attention to the Indian struggle for independence. The international pressure exerted played a role in shaping the eventual outcome of the trials, and it demonstrated the growing global awareness of the Indian nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Meerut Conspiracy Case was a significant political trial involving a large number of communists, trade unionists, and left-wing leaders accused of conspiring against the British Raj. The case was characterized by its extensive duration, the broad range of accused, and the harsh sentences imposed. The trial became a symbol of British repression of left-wing and labour movements in India, highlighting the colonial government's efforts to suppress dissent and maintain control.  The case also underscored the growing influence of communist and socialist ideologies within the Indian nationalist movement.


**5. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quit India Movement was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi, with limited involvement from other prominent nationalist leaders.
2. The movement witnessed widespread participation from students and workers, alongside nationalists and Satyagrahis.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi initiated the Quit India Movement with the famous "Quit India" resolution, the movement's execution involved a broad spectrum of nationalist leaders and activists.  Several figures played crucial roles in different regions, organizing resistance and leading local movements.  The decentralized nature of the resistance, given the widespread arrests of Congress leadership, highlights the movement's broad-based support and the numerous individuals who played pivotal roles in its success.  The absence of centralized leadership in many areas, due to mass arrests, made the movement all the more impressive.

Statement 2 is correct. The Quit India Movement saw significant participation from diverse segments of Indian society. Students and workers played a crucial role in the movement's mobilization and execution, alongside established nationalists and Satyagrahis. The movement’s widespread nature indicates the deep-seated anti-colonial sentiment that pervaded Indian society across various social and economic strata. The involvement of students and workers shows the movement's ability to transcend class divisions, uniting various sections of the population in the common goal of independence.


**6. With reference to the Cabinet Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet Mission's primary goal was to facilitate the immediate transfer of power to an independent India, without any interim arrangements.
2.  The Cabinet Mission plan proposed a three-tier structure for the future government of India, including a common center for specified subjects.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cabinet Mission, while aiming for the eventual transfer of power to India, did not propose the immediate transfer of power without any interim arrangements. The mission proposed a plan involving the formation of an interim government to manage the transition period before complete independence. This interim phase was crucial for navigating the complexities of power transfer and facilitating a smooth transition to self-governance. The mission understood that the process wouldn't be instantaneous, and an interim government was necessary to bridge the gap between colonial rule and complete independence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cabinet Mission Plan proposed a complex three-tier structure for the government of India.  This included a common center responsible for specific subjects such as defense, foreign affairs, and communications.  This structure aimed to balance the demands for autonomy from the provinces while maintaining a unified Indian state.  The proposal of a common center reflected the mission's attempt to create a federated structure that would accommodate the diverse interests and needs of various regions while preventing the disintegration of India.  The plan was ultimately unsuccessful but is significant in understanding the complexities of the political climate at the time.

**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's initial emphasis was primarily on boycotting British institutions and goods, with a secondary focus on constructive programs like Khadi production.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident, involving violence against police, directly led to the movement's suspension, showcasing the inherent tension between non-violent principles and mass mobilization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, initially focused heavily on non-cooperation with British institutions.  This included boycotts of government schools, colleges, courts, and foreign goods.  While constructive programs like Khadi production were promoted as part of the movement's broader aim of self-reliance and economic swadeshi, the initial emphasis was undeniably on the boycott strategy.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.

The Chauri Chaura incident, where a violent clash between protestors and police resulted in the death of policemen, significantly impacted Gandhi's decision to suspend the movement.  Gandhi, deeply committed to non-violence, saw this incident as a crucial turning point, highlighting the inherent difficulties in maintaining non-violent discipline within a large-scale mass movement. The incident exposed the limitations of controlling mass action and the fragility of maintaining non-violent principles under pressure. This directly led to the suspension of the movement in 1922. Thus, statement 2 is also correct.


**2. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement was launched immediately after the failure of the Cripps Mission, signifying a shift from constitutional negotiations to direct action.
2.  The arrest of top Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, inadvertently empowered the younger, more radical elements within the movement, leading to a surge in spontaneous and sometimes violent protests.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the failure of the Cripps Mission certainly contributed to the atmosphere that led to the Quit India Movement, the movement wasn't launched immediately afterward. There was a period of planning and preparation following the Cripps Mission's failure before the official launch of the Quit India Movement.  The timing involved several strategic considerations beyond simply reacting to the mission's failure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The preemptive arrest of Gandhi and other senior Congress leaders on August 9, 1942, removed the established leadership and control mechanisms of the movement. This vacuum created space for younger, more radical elements to take the lead, resulting in a wave of spontaneous and, in some instances, violent protests across the country.  The decentralized nature of the protests, driven by this younger leadership, was a defining characteristic of the movement.


**3. With reference to Jawaharlal Nehru's role in the Indian National Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nehru consistently advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) and vehemently opposed the acceptance of Dominion Status, even when it was offered as a compromise.
2.  Nehru's socialist leanings and emphasis on economic planning were evident throughout his political career, influencing his policies both during and after independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru was a strong proponent of complete independence for India (Purna Swaraj) from the beginning of his political career. He consistently rejected the idea of Dominion Status, viewing it as a continuation of British influence and not a true end to colonial rule. This is evident in his speeches and writings throughout the freedom struggle. Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.

Nehru's socialist leanings and belief in the importance of economic planning were deeply rooted in his ideology. His vision for independent India involved a strong emphasis on social justice, economic equality, and state-led planning for industrial development.  These views influenced his economic policies as Prime Minister, reflecting a clear departure from laissez-faire approaches. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Simon Commission:**

1.  The Commission's recommendations directly led to the immediate granting of full independence to India.
2. The All India Congress Committee (AICC) boycotted the Simon Commission due to its all-British composition and the absence of Indian representation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Simon Commission's recommendations did not lead to the immediate granting of full independence to India.  Its report formed the basis for further constitutional reforms, culminating in the Government of India Act of 1935, but it did not result in immediate independence.  Independence came much later, after a protracted struggle and significant developments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Simon Commission, appointed by the British government, consisted entirely of British members, excluding any Indian representation.  This blatant disregard for Indian participation led to widespread protests and a complete boycott of the Commission by the Indian National Congress, including the AICC.  The boycott was a significant demonstration of Indian nationalist sentiment.


**5. With reference to the Muslim League, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lahore Resolution of 1940, which formally demanded the creation of Pakistan, was passed unanimously within the League, signifying complete internal unity on the issue of partition.
2.  The Muslim League consistently opposed the Indian National Congress throughout its existence, never engaging in any form of cooperation or collaboration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Lahore Resolution of 1940 is pivotal in the demand for Pakistan, it was not passed unanimously. There were internal debates and differing opinions within the Muslim League regarding the approach to the issue of partition and the implications of a separate state.  The passage of the resolution does not indicate complete internal consensus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The relationship between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress was complex and evolved over time.  There were periods of cooperation and collaboration, particularly during the early years of the nationalist movement (such as the Lucknow Pact), as well as periods of intense rivalry and conflict.  The assertion of consistent opposition is an oversimplification of their intricate dynamic.


**6. With reference to the leaders of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji served as the President of the Indian National Congress for six consecutive years, showcasing his enduring influence within the organization.
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Motilal Nehru were prominent members of the Congress who strongly supported Gandhi's approach to non-violent resistance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji was indeed a prominent President of the Indian National Congress, but he did not serve for six consecutive years.  The presidency of the Congress was held for a single term, and individuals served in different years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Motilal Nehru were influential members of the Congress, their support for Gandhi's approach to non-violent resistance wasn't always complete or consistent.  Gokhale, a moderate, represented a different approach to the freedom struggle, and Motilal Nehru, although a close associate of Gandhi, had differences in political strategy at various points.  The statement oversimplifies their complex relationship with Gandhi's methods.


**7.  With reference to the revolutionary activities during the 1920s and 1930s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), was primarily focused on assassinations of individual British officials as its primary method of achieving independence.
2.  The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, was a significant event that demonstrated the willingness of revolutionaries to engage in armed rebellion against British rule.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the HRA/HSRA did engage in assassinations, it was not their *primary* focus.  Their ideology evolved over time, incorporating socialist and Marxist ideas, and their activities included attempts at wider revolutionary action and mass mobilization, not solely assassinations.  The statement simplifies their complex strategy and ideological development.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chittagong Armoury Raid, led by Surya Sen, was a bold and significant armed rebellion against the British.  It exemplified the willingness of revolutionaries to utilize armed struggle as a means to challenge colonial rule. The raid itself, its planning, and its aftermath highlight the revolutionary movement's determined efforts to overthrow British dominance through armed means.


**8. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance powers to the provinces, while retaining substantial control at the central level.
2. The Act completely abolished communal electorates, ensuring representation based purely on general elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced a system of provincial autonomy, transferring significant administrative and legislative powers to the provinces.  However, the Act retained considerable control at the central level, particularly through the governor-general's reserved powers and the structure of the federal government.  The Act's provisions for autonomy were limited, not complete.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act did *not* completely abolish communal electorates.  In fact, it continued and even expanded the system of separate electorates for certain communities, including Muslims, which further contributed to communal divisions and ultimately played a role in the partition of India.  The Act's failure to resolve communal issues is a significant aspect of its legacy.


**9. With reference to the events leading up to and including the partition of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet Mission Plan proposed a unified India with a weak central government and significant autonomy for provinces, addressing the concerns of both the Congress and the Muslim League.
2. The Mountbatten Plan, announced in June 1947, formalized the partition of India into India and Pakistan, setting the stage for the transfer of power and the subsequent independence of both nations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cabinet Mission Plan, while aiming for a unified India, did not propose a weak central government.  It suggested a three-tier structure with a strong central government responsible for defense, foreign affairs, and communications.  The plan's provision for grouping of provinces was a source of major contention and did not fully address the concerns of either the Congress or the Muslim League. The plan ultimately failed to achieve its objective of a unified India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mountbatten Plan, announced in June 1947, proposed a plan for the partition of India into two independent dominions – India and Pakistan.  This plan, accepted by both the Congress and the Muslim League, although reluctantly by the Congress, ultimately led to the transfer of power in August 1947 and the creation of two independent states.


**10. With reference to the individuals involved in the Indian freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1.  Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru were staunch allies throughout the independence movement, sharing identical views on all aspects of the struggle.
2.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a crucial role in integrating the princely states into the Indian Union after independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru were prominent leaders in the Indian National Congress, they did not always share identical views.  Bose's more radical and sometimes militaristic approach to the freedom struggle differed from Nehru's strategies.  The statement presents an oversimplified view of their complex relationship.

Statement 2 is correct. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's role in integrating the princely states into the Indian Union was instrumental in the formation of a unified India.  His diplomatic skills and firm approach were crucial in persuading many rulers to accede to the Indian Union, avoiding potential conflicts and maintaining national unity. His contribution to the integration process is a significant aspect of post-independence India.

**1. With reference to the Lahore session of the Indian National Congress, consider the following statements:**

1.  The session, presided over by Jawaharlal Nehru, witnessed the adoption of "Poorna Swaraj" as the Congress's official goal.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose, then President of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee, vehemently opposed the resolution for Purna Swaraj, advocating for continued dominion status negotiations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lahore session of the Indian National Congress in December 1929, presided over by Jawaharlal Nehru, is indeed historically significant for the adoption of "Poorna Swaraj" (complete independence) as the Congress's primary objective. This marked a shift from the earlier focus on dominion status within the British Empire.  The declaration of Purna Swaraj was a pivotal moment, signaling a more assertive and radical approach to the freedom struggle.  The decision to declare complete independence was a culmination of growing nationalist sentiment and a rejection of the limited autonomy offered by the British.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Subhas Chandra Bose, while having his own distinct political views and advocating for a more aggressive approach to achieving independence, did *not* oppose the declaration of "Poorna Swaraj" at the Lahore session.  In fact, he fully endorsed the decision.  His disagreements with Gandhi and other Congress leaders primarily revolved around the *methods* of achieving independence, with Bose favoring a more forceful and potentially less strictly non-violent approach than Gandhi.  However, the adoption of "Poorna Swaraj" itself aligned with his ultimate goal of complete Indian independence.  The statement misrepresents Bose's position on this specific resolution.


**2. With reference to the personalities involved in the Indian Independence Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji served as the President of the Indian National Congress for a total of six consecutive years.
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent leader of the Moderate faction, founded the Servants of India Society, which played a crucial role in advocating for dominion status.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Dadabhai Naoroji was a prominent and influential figure in the Indian National Congress, serving as President on three separate occasions, he never served for six consecutive years. The presidency of the INC was an annual position, and different leaders held the post each year. The statement incorrectly attributes a continuous six-year tenure to him.

Statement 2 is correct. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a key figure in the Moderate faction of the Indian National Congress. He was known for his advocacy of constitutional methods and gradual progress towards self-governance.  He is indeed credited with founding the Servants of India Society in 1905. This organization played a significant role in promoting social reform and advocating for Indian interests within the existing political framework. The Servants of India Society was instrumental in training and providing a platform for future nationalist leaders.  The Society's activities aligned with Gokhale's moderate approach, which focused on constitutional means to achieve self-government, rather than immediate independence.


**3. With reference to the Simon Commission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commission's report, published in 1930, strongly advocated for granting India immediate dominion status.
2.  The Indian National Congress, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, actively participated in the Commission's proceedings and submitted detailed recommendations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Simon Commission's report, published in 1930, did *not* advocate for immediate dominion status for India.  In fact, it was largely perceived as unsatisfactory and even regressive by Indian nationalists because it fell short of their demands for greater self-governance. The report's recommendations were seen as insufficient and did not address the core concerns of Indian nationalists regarding their political and economic rights.  The lack of Indian representation on the Commission further fueled the widespread dissatisfaction with its findings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian National Congress, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, *boycotted* the Simon Commission. The boycott was a significant act of protest against the Commission's all-British composition, which symbolized the British government's disregard for Indian aspirations and self-determination. The Congress felt that any commission without Indian representation could not adequately address the needs and concerns of the Indian people.  The boycott was a powerful demonstration of Indian nationalism and solidified the Congress's position against British rule.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of the Poona Pact:**

1. The Poona Pact, signed in 1932, led to the establishment of separate electorates for the depressed classes, granting them increased political representation.
2.  The pact, while securing more reserved seats for the depressed classes, ultimately hindered their social and economic advancement by reinforcing their subordinate position within the Hindu social hierarchy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Poona Pact, signed in 1932,  *abandoned* the idea of separate electorates for the depressed classes, a key provision of the Communal Award. This was a significant concession made by B.R. Ambedkar, who initially favored separate electorates to ensure the depressed classes' independent political voice.  The pact instead focused on increasing the number of reserved seats for the depressed classes within a joint electorate.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Poona Pact did result in a greater number of reserved seats for the depressed classes, it's argued that it ultimately limited their progress toward true social and economic equality. By retaining the framework of reserved seats within the existing caste system, the pact arguably perpetuated the depressed classes' subordinate position within the Hindu social hierarchy.  It also created a system where the representation of the depressed classes could be manipulated by dominant caste groups.  The pact, therefore, while offering some political gains, did not fully address the underlying social and economic inequalities faced by the depressed classes.  The long-term consequences of the pact are still debated among scholars, with many pointing to its limitations in achieving true social justice.


**5. With reference to the activities of Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bose's presidency of the Indian National Congress was marked by a strong emphasis on non-violent resistance, aligning with Gandhi's ideology.
2.  Bose's formation of the Forward Bloc represented a significant ideological divergence from the mainstream Congress, advocating for a more assertive and potentially violent approach to independence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Subhas Chandra Bose's tenure as President of the Indian National Congress was characterized by a significant departure from Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance. While Bose respected Gandhi, he advocated for a more assertive and proactive approach to achieving independence, even if it meant employing methods that deviated from strict non-violence.  His differences with Gandhi, particularly regarding the methods of the freedom struggle, led to considerable internal conflict within the Congress.

Statement 2 is correct. The formation of the Forward Bloc in 1939 by Subhas Chandra Bose was a direct consequence of his ideological differences with the mainstream Congress leadership, particularly Mahatma Gandhi.  The Forward Bloc represented a more radical and assertive wing within the nationalist movement, advocating for a more active and potentially less strictly non-violent approach to securing India's independence.  The Bloc's formation marked a significant split within the Congress and showcased the growing tensions between those who favored a strictly non-violent approach and those who believed in a more forceful strategy to challenge British rule.  The formation of the Forward Bloc is a testament to the diverse political ideologies within the Indian nationalist movement.


**6. With reference to the Government of India Act of 1935, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant powers to elected provincial governments.
2. The Act established a completely independent and sovereign Indian state, free from any British control or influence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1935 is a landmark piece of legislation that significantly altered the political landscape of British India.  A key feature of the Act was the introduction of provincial autonomy, which transferred considerable administrative and legislative powers to elected provincial governments.  This marked a significant step towards greater self-governance in India, although it fell short of complete independence. The Act aimed to create a more representative system of government at the provincial level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Government of India Act of 1935 did *not* establish a completely independent and sovereign Indian state.  India remained under British rule, with the British government retaining ultimate authority and control over crucial areas such as defence, foreign affairs, and the overall constitutional framework.  While the Act granted greater autonomy to the provinces, it was still fundamentally a colonial instrument designed to manage and control India within the British Empire.  The Act did not grant India full independence or sovereignty. The Act's provisions did not fully satisfy Indian nationalists, who continued to strive for complete independence from British rule.


**7.  Consider the following statements concerning the role of women in the Indian Independence Movement:**

1.  Gandhi's approach towards women's participation in the movement was largely traditional, emphasizing their role as homemakers and caregivers, while limiting their involvement in direct political action.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose advocated for complete gender equality and actively encouraged women's participation in combat roles within the Indian National Army (INA).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Gandhi championed women's rights and sought to uplift their status, his views on their role in society and the freedom struggle were often rooted in traditional gender roles. He encouraged women's participation in the movement, but his vision often emphasized their contributions within the domestic sphere and through non-violent methods, such as picketing and boycotts.  He did not fully embrace the idea of women taking on roles traditionally considered masculine.  His perspective was a complex blend of progressive and conservative ideals, reflecting the societal norms of his time.

Statement 2 is correct.  Subhas Chandra Bose held a far more radical view on women's role in the nation. He was a strong advocate for complete gender equality and actively sought to break down traditional gender barriers.  His most striking example of this was the formation of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment within the Indian National Army (INA), where women were actively trained and participated in combat roles alongside men. This demonstrated a revolutionary departure from prevailing social norms and highlighted Bose's commitment to women's full and equal participation in the freedom struggle.  The INA's women's regiment stands as a testament to Bose's forward-thinking approach to gender equality.


**8. With reference to the economic policies advocated by prominent leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahatma Gandhi championed large-scale industrialization as the primary means to alleviate poverty and uplift the Indian economy.
2.  Subhas Chandra Bose advocated for a socialist-oriented economy with significant state control over key industries and planned economic development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mahatma Gandhi's economic vision was markedly different from the prevailing emphasis on industrialization. He advocated for a decentralized, village-based economy that prioritized self-sufficiency and traditional crafts.  He was deeply critical of large-scale industrialization, believing it would lead to exploitation and social disruption.  His focus was on reviving the rural economy and empowering villagers through cottage industries and sustainable practices.  His economic philosophy was rooted in his broader principles of self-reliance, simplicity, and social justice.

Statement 2 is correct. Subhas Chandra Bose's economic vision was shaped by a socialist ideology. He strongly advocated for a planned economy with state control over key industries to drive industrialization and address issues of poverty and unemployment. He recognized the importance of both large-scale and small-scale industries but emphasized the crucial role of the state in guiding economic development.  His ideas reflected a belief in the potential of industrialization to modernize India and improve the lives of its citizens, but under a framework of social justice and equitable distribution of wealth.  His support for state-led industrialization contrasts sharply with Gandhi's approach.


**9. With reference to the religious views of Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's religious beliefs were deeply intertwined with his political ideology, emphasizing non-violence and a pluralistic approach to religious co-existence.
2.  Bose, while respecting Hindu traditions, advocated for a completely secular state in independent India, with the state remaining entirely neutral in religious matters.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahatma Gandhi's religious beliefs profoundly influenced his political thought and actions.  His philosophy of satyagraha, emphasizing non-violent resistance, was deeply rooted in his religious convictions.  He promoted a pluralistic vision of India, advocating for religious tolerance and harmony among different faiths.  His commitment to religious inclusivity was a crucial aspect of his political ideology, reflecting his belief in the unity of all religions and the importance of respecting diverse religious practices.

Statement 2 is correct.  While Subhas Chandra Bose held deep respect for Hindu traditions and spirituality, he was a staunch advocate for a completely secular state in independent India. He believed that the state should remain entirely neutral in religious matters, ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs.  His vision of a secular state was an integral part of his political ideology, emphasizing the importance of religious freedom and preventing religious discrimination.  This aligns with his broader commitment to equality and social justice.  His secular views contrast with Gandhi's more syncretic approach, though both leaders sought religious tolerance.


**10. With reference to the  Government of India Act, 1919, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduced the system of dyarchy, dividing powers between elected and nominated representatives at the provincial level.
2. The Act granted complete independence to India, establishing a fully sovereign and self-governing nation.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced a system of dyarchy, a form of dual government, at the provincial level.  Under this system, certain subjects (called "transferred subjects") were placed under the control of elected ministers responsible to the provincial legislatures, while other subjects ("reserved subjects") remained under the direct control of the governor, representing the British government. Dyarchy was a step towards greater Indian participation in governance, but it did not grant full self-rule. It was a compromise measure intended to partially grant self-governance while maintaining British control over key areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Government of India Act, 1919 did *not* grant complete independence to India.  India remained firmly under British rule; the Act was a colonial measure aimed at reforming the existing system of governance, not ending British rule.  The Act's provisions fell far short of the demands of Indian nationalists who were striving for complete self-determination and independence.  The limited self-governance introduced by the Act was seen as inadequate and did not satisfy the aspirations of many Indian nationalists.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions on the Supreme Court of India, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Judgement/Action          Associated Legal Concept/Act
1.  Kesavananda Bharati Case                 :   Doctrine of Prospective Overruling
2.  Minerva Mills Case                     :   Basic Structure Doctrine
3.  Golak Nath Case                        :   Doctrine of Eclipse
4.  Invalidation of NJAC Act, 2014       :   Judicial Review
5.  Interpretation of Article 32             :   Writ Jurisdiction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) is significantly linked to the development of the "basic structure doctrine," which limits Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  However, the case also saw the Supreme Court utilize the Doctrine of Prospective Overruling. The Minerva Mills case (1980) further solidified the basic structure doctrine.  The Golaknath case (1967) is associated with the Doctrine of Eclipse, dealing with the relationship between fundamental rights and legislation. The invalidation of the NJAC Act in 2014 is a prime example of the Supreme Court's power of judicial review.  Article 32 explicitly grants the Supreme Court the power to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights, a core aspect of its writ jurisdiction.  Option (d) is incorrect because while Golaknath is linked to the Doctrine of Eclipse, its primary focus wasn't solely on this doctrine; other legal concepts were also involved in the judgment. Option (a), (b) are incomplete, missing key correct pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article            Supreme Court Power/Jurisdiction
1. Article 143                         :   Original Jurisdiction in election disputes
2. Article 136                         :   Special Leave to Appeal
3. Article 32                          :   Advisory Jurisdiction
4. Article 124                         :   Power to punish for contempt
5. Article 131                         :   Appellate Jurisdiction over High Courts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 136 grants the Supreme Court the discretionary power of Special Leave to Appeal. Article 124 establishes the Supreme Court and implicitly grants it the power to punish for contempt. Article 131 outlines the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, which includes disputes between the Union and States, but not election disputes (those fall under Articles 71 and 329). Article 32 relates to the Supreme Court's power to enforce Fundamental Rights through writs, not advisory jurisdiction (that is under Article 143). Article 132 and 133 deals with the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over High Courts.  Option (a), (c), (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect pairings of Constitutional Articles with Supreme Court powers.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Doctrine                  Supreme Court Application
1. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction :   Interpretation of conflicting laws
2. Doctrine of Severability           :   Striking down parts of a law
3. Doctrine of Waiver                 :   Forfeiture of rights
4. Doctrine of Prospective Overruling :   Retroactive application of judgements
5. Doctrine of Pith and Substance      :   Determining the essence of a law

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction guides the Supreme Court in interpreting potentially conflicting laws by attempting to reconcile them. The Doctrine of Severability allows the Court to invalidate only the unconstitutional parts of a law, leaving the rest intact. The Doctrine of Waiver deals with situations where individuals or entities forfeit their legal rights through actions or inaction. The Doctrine of Prospective Overruling means the Supreme Court's new ruling applies only to future cases, not retroactively affecting past judgements. The Doctrine of Pith and Substance helps determine the true nature and subject matter of a law. Option (b), (c), (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrect pairing, particularly concerning the Doctrine of Prospective Overruling and its retroactive implications.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

    President's Action/Power              Supreme Court Role
1.  Impeachment of the President        :   Conducts enquiry and provides advice
2.  Seeking advisory opinion             :   Provides binding advice
3.  Election disputes of the President  :   Exclusive original jurisdiction
4.  Removal of UPSC members           :   Conducts enquiry and provides binding advice
5.  Appointment of Supreme Court Judges  :   Consults with Collegium

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

In the impeachment of the President, the Supreme Court plays a role in the process, but the advice it provides is not binding.  The President can seek advisory opinions from the Supreme Court on questions of law or fact, but the opinion is not binding. The Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction in Presidential election disputes. The Supreme Court conducts enquiries into the conduct of UPSC members and gives binding advice regarding their removal.  The President appoints Supreme Court judges based on the recommendations of the Collegium system, not through direct consultation with the Supreme Court itself. Option (b), (c), (d) are incorrect because they contain incorrect or incomplete pairings of the President's actions and the Supreme Court's role.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Writ                      Purpose/Effect
1.  Habeas Corpus                     :   Challenges legality of detention
2.  Mandamus                           :   Compels performance of a public duty
3.  Prohibition                        :   Prevents an inferior court from exceeding its jurisdiction
4.  Certiorari                         :   Quashes an order of an inferior court
5.  Quo Warranto                       :   Challenges the right of a person to hold public office


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs accurately describe the purpose and effect of the five prerogative writs issued by the Supreme Court and High Courts in India.  Each writ has a distinct function within the Indian legal system related to ensuring accountability and upholding the rule of law. There is no incorrect pairing; hence options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, primarily factual recall with elements of analysis and evaluation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Institution          Power/Function
1.  Supreme Court of India     :   Issues writs only for enforcing Fundamental Rights
2.  High Court                :   Has original jurisdiction in election disputes for President and Vice-President
3.  Lok Adalat                 :   Handles cases referred by the Supreme Court
4.  Gram Nyayalaya            :   Appeals against its decisions go directly to the Supreme Court

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Supreme Court *can* issue writs for enforcing Fundamental Rights, but its writ jurisdiction isn't limited to only this; it can also issue writs in other matters (although the High Court's writ jurisdiction is broader). Statement 2 is incorrect; the Supreme Court, not the High Court, has original and exclusive jurisdiction in election disputes for the President and Vice-President. Statement 3 is correct; Lok Adalats handle cases referred by courts. Statement 4 is incorrect; appeals from Gram Nyayalayas go to the High Court, not directly to the Supreme Court.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of the powers and jurisdictions of different Indian legal institutions and highlights the nuanced differences in their functions to create plausible distractors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body           Responsibility/Power
1.  State Governments          :   Delegates mining authority to Central Government
2.  Central Government         :   Owns minerals within state boundaries
3.  GST Council                :   State Governments have equal voting weight
4.  Gram Nyayalayas            :   Established solely by State Governments without Central consultation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Central Government delegates mining authority to State Governments, not vice-versa. Statement 2 is incorrect; State Governments own minerals within their boundaries, not the Central Government. Statement 3 is correct;  while the voting weight isn't perfectly equal, it's a significant aspect of the GST Council's structure. Statement 4 is incorrect; State Governments establish Gram Nyayalayas *in consultation* with the Central Government.  The question effectively uses incorrect and partially correct statements to test the candidate's understanding of the distribution of powers between the central and state governments in India.  The inclusion of the GST Council and Gram Nyayalayas adds complexity and acts as distractors.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept               Court's Power/Action
1.  Civil Contempt              :   Punishment limited to six months imprisonment and/or ₹2000 fine.
2.  Criminal Contempt           :   Includes scandalizing or lowering the authority of a court.
3.  Judicial Review              :   Cannot be curtailed by constitutional amendment (as per the basic structure doctrine).
4.  Advisory Jurisdiction        :   Supreme Court must always tender its opinion to the President.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct regarding the limits of punishment for civil contempt. Statement 2 accurately describes criminal contempt. Statement 3 correctly states the Supreme Court's established position on judicial review's unamendable nature (per the basic structure doctrine). Statement 4 is incorrect; the Supreme Court *may* refuse to tender its opinion to the President in matters of advisory jurisdiction.  This question tests detailed knowledge of legal concepts and the Supreme Court's powers, requiring careful analysis of each statement's accuracy.  The inclusion of the less frequently discussed Advisory Jurisdiction adds difficulty.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                   Action/Function
1.  Supreme Court Legal Services Committee    :   Located in the High Court
2.  High Court Legal Services Committee        :   Related to the Supreme Court
3.  Election Commission of India (ECI)          :   Permitted by the Supreme Court
4.  NITI Aayog                                   :   Makes recommendations to State Governments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2,3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee is within the Supreme Court, not the High Court. Statement 2 is incorrect; the High Court Legal Services Committee is independent and functions within the High Court system. Statement 3 is correct; the ECI's actions are subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court, implying a form of permission/oversight. Statement 4 is correct about NITI Aayog's function. The question tests knowledge of different organizations and their interrelationships, using partially correct and incorrect statements to add complexity and challenge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Body                 Characteristic/Power
1. Lok Sabha                      :   Can extend its own term indefinitely
2. Rajya Sabha                    :   Has equal power with Lok Sabha on ordinary bills
3. Council of Ministers            :   Size is directly proportional to Lok Sabha membership
4. President                       :   Can dissolve Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect;  Lok Sabha's term can be extended, but only under specific circumstances (national emergency), and it's not indefinite.  Statement 2 is correct; both houses have equal powers on ordinary bills. Statement 3 is incorrect; the size of the Council of Ministers isn't directly proportional to Lok Sabha size, it's limited by a percentage. Statement 4 is correct regarding the President's power to dissolve the Lok Sabha.  This question tests knowledge of the Indian political system, using partially correct and outright incorrect statements to challenge the candidate's understanding of the nuances of power sharing and constitutional limits.

**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Provision
1. Article 324                      :   Establishment of the Election Commission
2. Article 370                      :   Special status for Jammu and Kashmir (now repealed)
3. Article 291                      :   Power of the State to borrow money
4. Article 14 and 21                :   Right to Equality and Right to Life
5.  Articles 82 and 170             :   Allocation of seats in Parliament and State Legislatures

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 324 of the Constitution of India deals with the Election Commission of India, which is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Article 291 grants the power of state to borrow money on the security of the Consolidated Fund of the state.  This power is subject to restrictions and conditions imposed by Parliament. Hence, pair 3 is also correctly matched. Articles 82 and 170 prescribe the manner of determining the total number of seats in the Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies respectively,  making pair 5 a correct match.

Pair 2 is incorrect because while Article 370 formerly provided for a special status for Jammu and Kashmir, it has since been repealed.  Pair 4 is incorrect because it combines two distinct fundamental rights: Article 14 guarantees the right to equality and Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.  These are not a single provision.  The combination of these articles in a single pair is misleading and factually incorrect in the context of a single provision.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                      Year of Enactment
1. Indian Treasure and Trove Act        :   1978
2. Ancient Monuments Preservation Act   :   1951
3. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act :   1878
4. Public Records Act                     :   1904
5.  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act     :   1947

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The correct years of enactment are as follows:

1. Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878
2. Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904
3. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947
4. Public Records Act, 1993
5. Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972

The options provided contain several incorrect years, designed to test the examinee's precise knowledge of the legislative history of these acts.  The incorrect years are strategically placed as distractors, making this a challenging question requiring precise factual recall.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment           Key Feature
1. 44th Amendment                   :   Introduced Fundamental Duties
2. 73rd Amendment                   :   Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 74th Amendment                   :   Urban Local Bodies
4. First Amendment                  :   Amendment to the Fundamental Rights
5. 58th Amendment                  :   Removal of Article 370

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayati Raj institutions. The 74th Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX-A, dealing with Urban Local Bodies.  The First Amendment Act of 1951 included several amendments to the Fundamental Rights, primarily to address concerns raised by the judiciary regarding the scope of free speech and property rights. Thus pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect; while the 44th Amendment did make significant changes, including the inclusion of Fundamental Duties, it's not the sole defining feature of that amendment.  Pair 5 is incorrect;  the 58th Amendment did not remove Article 370; that was done through separate legislation.  The inclusion of these incorrect pairs makes the question more challenging and tests the candidate's thorough understanding of constitutional amendments.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Schedule of the Constitution      Subject Matter
1. Eighth Schedule                   :    Official Languages
2. Fifth Schedule                    :    Administration of Scheduled Areas
3. Ninth Schedule                    :    Laws immune from judicial review
4. Tenth Schedule                    :    Anti-Defection Law
5. Third Schedule                     :    Forms of Oaths or Affirmations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Eighth Schedule lists the official languages of India. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in certain states. The Ninth Schedule was created to protect certain laws from judicial review. The Tenth Schedule deals with the anti-defection law. The Third Schedule contains the forms of oaths and affirmations.  While the Ninth Schedule has faced judicial scrutiny and its scope has been limited, it initially aimed to provide protection from judicial review. The comprehensive nature of this question, including all correct pairs, assesses the candidate's detailed knowledge of the schedules of the Indian Constitution and their specific functions.  Incorrect options are included as distractors to further challenge the candidate.


**10.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Jurisdiction              Court
1. Original Jurisdiction             :   High Court
2. Appellate Jurisdiction            :   Supreme Court
3. Advisory Jurisdiction             :   Supreme Court
4. Writ Jurisdiction                  :   High Court
5. Concurrent Jurisdiction           :   Supreme Court and High Court

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  High Courts and Supreme Court both possess original, appellate and writ jurisdictions. The Supreme Court has unique advisory jurisdiction where the President can seek its opinion on any matter of law or fact.  High Courts exercise original jurisdiction in cases within their respective states. Supreme Court exercises appellate jurisdiction over High Courts. The Supreme Court and High Courts have concurrent writ jurisdiction in certain cases. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the different types of jurisdictions exercised by the Indian judicial system. The inclusion of all correct pairs ensures a high difficulty level, demanding complete knowledge of the subject.  Distracting options are provided to make the question challenging and prevent easy guessing.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                          Year of Enactment
1. Indian Treasure and Trove Act          :   1879
2. Ancient Monuments Preservation Act     :   1904
3. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act   :   1948
4. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act :   1958
5. Antiquities and Art Treasure Act       :   1972

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act (1904) and the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act (1972) are correctly matched with their years of enactment.  The other options contain incorrect years.  The Indian Treasure and Trove Act was enacted in 1878, not 1879. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act was enacted in 1947, not 1948. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act was enacted in 1958, not 1958.  These discrepancies highlight the importance of precise factual recall in questions related to Indian legal history. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding acts and their respective years of enactment, a crucial skill for understanding the evolution of Indian law. The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, making it a challenging question that requires in-depth knowledge of Indian legal history.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                     Subject Matter
1. Article 29                               :   Protection of interests of minorities
2. Article 324                               :   Election Commission
3. Article 370                               :   Special status of Jammu and Kashmir (prior to abrogation)
4. Article 291                               :   Power of State to borrow
5. Article 343(1)                           :   Official Languages of the Union

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 29 deals with the protection of interests of minorities. Article 324 pertains to the Election Commission of India. Article 370 (prior to its abrogation) dealt with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 291 relates to the power of a State to borrow. Article 343(1) specifies the official languages of the Union.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific constitutional articles and their corresponding subjects, a fundamental requirement for understanding the Indian Constitution.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes it a high-difficulty question requiring thorough understanding and recall of constitutional provisions.  There are no incorrect or misleading pairs designed as distractors; the difficulty lies in the sheer volume of information required for accurate matching.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                          Provision Related To
1. Public Records Act, 1993                 :   Maintenance of Public Records
2. Indian Independence Act, 1947           :   Transfer of Power
3. Government of India Act, 1935           :   Establishment of a Federal Court
4. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 :   Establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions
5.  The Indian Penal Code (1860)         :   Protection of Wildlife

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Public Records Act of 1993 is indeed concerned with the maintenance of public records. The Government of India Act, 1935, established the Federal Court of India, a precursor to the Supreme Court. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 established the three-tier Panchayati Raj system. However, the Indian Penal Code (1860) does not contain provisions directly related to the protection of wildlife; wildlife protection falls under separate legislation. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various important Acts and their specific purposes within the broader context of Indian law and governance. The distractor (pair 5) is designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the scope of different legal instruments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act               Key Feature
1. 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act        :   Inclusion of Fundamental Duties
2. 58th Constitutional Amendment Act        :   Lowering of voting age to 18
3. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act        :   Establishment of Municipalities
4. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act        :   Establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions
5. First Constitutional Amendment Act        :   Inclusion of Directive Principles of State Policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The 42nd Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 58th Amendment Act reduced the voting age to 18 years. The 74th Amendment Act deals with the establishment of urban local governments (municipalities). The inclusion of the 73rd Amendment (Panchayats) as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the distinction between rural and urban local governance structures.  The First Amendment did not include the Directive Principles; they were already part of the original Constitution. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of significant Constitutional Amendment Acts and their key provisions, a crucial aspect of Indian Polity. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge and ability to differentiate between closely related amendments.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                         Responsibility
1.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Appoints judges of the Supreme Court
2.  Election Commission of India           :   Conducts elections to the Rajya Sabha
3.  Finance Commission                      :   Recommends principles governing grants-in-aid to states
4.  National Human Rights Commission      :   Investigates human rights violations
5.  Attorney General of India               :   Represents the Government in Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Finance Commission is responsible for recommending the principles governing the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States, including grants-in-aid. The National Human Rights Commission investigates human rights violations. The Attorney General represents the Government of India in the Supreme Court. The UPSC does not appoint Supreme Court judges; that is the President's prerogative in consultation with the Chief Justice of India.  The Election Commission conducts elections to the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, not the Rajya Sabha (the Rajya Sabha elections are conducted by the Election Commission, but the members of the electoral college who elect the Rajya Sabha representatives are elected by the State Legislative Assemblies). This question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles and functions of various constitutional bodies, demanding precise knowledge of their responsibilities within the Indian governance structure. The incorrect pairs act as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to recall specific details.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act Feature
1. 42nd Amendment Act                    :   Added "Socialist", "Secular", and "Integrity" to the Preamble
2. 44th Amendment Act                    :   Removed the Right to Property as a Fundamental Right
3. 52nd Amendment Act                    :   Introduced the Anti-Defection Law
4. 73rd Amendment Act                    :   Established Panchayati Raj institutions
5. 74th Amendment Act                    :   Established Municipalities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Preamble by incorporating the words "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity," reflecting a shift in the nation's ideological orientation. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights, transforming it into a legal right under Article 300A.  The 52nd Amendment Act of 1985 introduced the Anti-Defection Law, aiming to curb political defections and enhance the stability of the government. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 established a three-tier Panchayati Raj system to empower local self-governance at the village, intermediate, and district levels.  Similarly, the 74th Amendment Act of 1992 established a three-tier system of Municipalities for urban local governance. All these amendments represent key changes in the Indian Constitution, directly impacting its structure, ideology and governance.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution   Provision
1. Article 21                         :   Right to Education
2. Article 32                         :   Right to Constitutional Remedies
3. Article 300A                       :   Right to Property
4. Article 17                         :   Abolition of Untouchability
5. Article 226                        :   Writ Jurisdiction of High Courts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 32 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, enabling citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. Article 300A enshrines the Right to Property as a legal right, albeit not a fundamental right. Article 17 abolishes untouchability, a practice that violates the principles of equality and dignity. Article 226 grants High Courts the power of writ jurisdiction, allowing them to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and other legal rights within their respective jurisdictions.  However, Article 21, while encompassing the right to life and personal liberty, does not explicitly include the right to education as a fundamental right; this right was later incorporated as a fundamental right by the Right to Education Act.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept              Originating Country
1. Public Interest Litigation (PIL) :   United Kingdom
2. Judicial Review                :   United States
3. Doctrine of Basic Structure    :   India
4. Habeas Corpus                  :   England
5. Rule of Law                     :   England


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The concept of Judicial Review, where courts can assess the constitutionality of laws, originated in the United States. The Doctrine of Basic Structure, which limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, is a unique feature developed by the Indian judiciary.  Habeas Corpus, a writ protecting against unlawful detention, and the Rule of Law, emphasizing the supremacy of law and equality before the law, both have their roots in English legal tradition. However, Public Interest Litigation (PIL), while significantly developed in India, doesn't solely originate in the United Kingdom; its roots are found in various common law jurisdictions.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones. Only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are definitively correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body              Key Responsibility
1. Election Commission of India     :   Appointment of Governors
2. Union Public Service Commission :   Conduct of Elections
3. Comptroller and Auditor General :   Auditing Government Accounts
4. Finance Commission               :   Recommending Fiscal Distribution
5. National Human Rights Commission:   Protecting Human Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is mandated to protect and promote human rights.  The Election Commission of India conducts elections, and the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts recruitment for civil services.  Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either misattribute responsibilities or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political System       Characteristic
1. Parliamentary System     :    Strict Separation of Powers
2. Presidential System     :    Fusion of Powers
3. Parliamentary System     :    Collective Responsibility
4. Presidential System     :    Single Executive
5. Parliamentary System     :    Head of State distinct from Head of Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Parliamentary system is characterized by collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the legislature, a fusion of powers between the executive and legislature, and a distinction between the Head of State (e.g., President) and the Head of Government (e.g., Prime Minister). The Presidential system features a single executive (President) who is both the head of state and government, with a relatively strict separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.  Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.

**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Judgement     Impact
1. Kesavananda Bharati Case   :   Established the doctrine of "Basic Structure"
2. Minerva Mills Case          :   Upheld the basic structure doctrine
3. Golak Nath Case             :   Limited Parliament's amending power
4. S.R. Bommai Case           :   Defined the scope of Article 356
5. I.R. Coelho Case            :   Clarified the extent of the Ninth Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) established the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution, limiting the Parliament's power to amend fundamental aspects of the Constitution. The Minerva Mills case (1980) reaffirmed the basic structure doctrine. The Golak Nath case (1967) initially limited Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights. The S.R. Bommai case (1994) set important precedents concerning the application of Article 356 (President's Rule). The I.R. Coelho case (2007) significantly limited the protection afforded to laws placed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Judge                       Contribution to Indian Legal System
1. Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer     :   Introduction of the Collegium System
2. Justice P.N. Bhagwati        :   Pioneering Public Interest Litigation (PIL)
3. Justice H.R. Khanna          :   Dissenting Opinion in the ADM Jabalpur case
4. Justice M. Hidayatullah       :   Chief Justice of India during the Emergency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Justice P.N. Bhagwati played a crucial role in pioneering Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in India, making the courts more accessible to marginalized groups. Justice H.R. Khanna's dissenting opinion in the ADM Jabalpur case (1976) is a landmark example of judicial courage during the Emergency. Justice M. Hidayatullah served as Chief Justice of India during a significant period of Indian history. The collegium system, for the appointment of judges, was not introduced by a single judge but evolved through a series of Supreme Court judgements and practices.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body           Mode of Removal
1. Judges of the Supreme Court  :    Impeachment by Parliament
2. Governor of a State           :    Impeachment by Parliament
3. Chief Election Commissioner   :    Removal by Parliament on Presidential Recommendation
4. Comptroller and Auditor General:    Removal by Parliament on Presidential Recommendation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Judges of the Supreme Court can be removed through impeachment by Parliament, a process requiring a special majority in both Houses.  The Chief Election Commissioner and the Comptroller and Auditor General can be removed by Parliament on the recommendation of the President.  However, the removal of a Governor is not through impeachment by Parliament; the President can dismiss a Governor.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Schedule of the Constitution   Subject Matter
1. Fifth Schedule                 :   Administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas
2. Sixth Schedule                 :   Provisions for Autonomous District Councils in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram
3. Seventh Schedule               :   Distribution of Legislative Powers
4. Eighth Schedule                :   Recognition of Classical Languages
5. Ninth Schedule                 :   Protection of Laws from Judicial Review (partially limited)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas, particularly in the states where they exist. The Sixth Schedule outlines special provisions for the administration of tribal areas in certain states. The Seventh Schedule enumerates the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List, dictating the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and State Governments.  The Ninth Schedule initially provided protection from judicial review for laws included in it, but this protection has been significantly curtailed by subsequent Supreme Court judgements. The Eighth Schedule lists the recognized languages of India, but not necessarily the classical languages. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act of Parliament           Provision
1. Representation of the People Act, 1951:   Governs Elections to Parliament and State Legislatures
2. Right to Information Act, 2005           :   Enshrines the Right to Information
3. Right to Education Act, 2009           :   Makes Education a Fundamental Right
4. National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014:   Declared Unconstitutional
5. The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989:   Protects SCs and STs from Atrocities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Representation of the People Act, 1951, governs the electoral process for the Parliament and State Legislatures. The Right to Information Act, 2005, establishes the Right to Information for citizens. The Right to Education Act, 2009, made education a fundamental right for children aged 6-14. The National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014, was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, protects members of these communities from atrocities. Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Constitution of India and related laws, institutions, and figures.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level, aiming to test both factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                      Key Provision/Feature
1.  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972          :   Regulates the export of antiquities
2.  Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878            :   Deals with the discovery of hidden treasure
3.  Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904       :   Protects ancient monuments from damage
4.  Public Records Act, 1993                       :   Manages the preservation of public records
5.  The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act, 1951 :  Defines national importance of specific sites


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs represent accurate matches between the Acts/Legislation and their primary focus.  The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, indeed regulates the export of antiquities to protect India's cultural heritage.  The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878, deals with the legal aspects of discovering hidden treasure, outlining the rights and responsibilities of finders and the government.  The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, is specifically designed to safeguard ancient monuments from damage and destruction. The Public Records Act, 1993, establishes a framework for managing and preserving public records. Lastly, The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act, 1951,  focuses on declaring specific sites as nationally important, thus providing them with increased protection.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article/Section                    Related Subject
1.  Article 324                                     :   Election disputes of the President
2.  Article 370 (as it existed before abrogation) :   Special status of Jammu and Kashmir
3.  Eighth Schedule                                :   Official Languages of India
4.  Article 29                                      :   Protection of interests of minorities
5.  Part VI                                        :   States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs except the first one are correctly matched. Article 324 deals with the Election Commission, not specifically with the President's election disputes, although the Election Commission handles presidential elections.  Article 370, before its abrogation, provided special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The Eighth Schedule lists the official languages of India. Article 29 protects the rights and interests of minorities. Part VI of the Constitution deals with the States, their organization, and relations with the Union. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.


**3.  With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Concept/Provision                Associated Feature
1.  Directive Principles of State Policy             :   Non-justiciable in nature
2.  Fundamental Duties                              :   Moral obligations of citizens
3.  Preamble                                         :   States the objectives of the Constitution
4.  Seventh Schedule                               :   Distribution of legislative powers
5.  Article 39A                                     :   Equal justice and free legal aid


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched.  Directive Principles of State Policy are indeed non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts. Fundamental Duties are moral obligations, not legally enforceable rights. The Preamble sets out the goals and ideals of the Constitution. The Seventh Schedule outlines the division of legislative powers between the Union and States. Article 39A is related to equal justice and free legal aid.  Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer; the other options incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body/Institution                     Defined/Established by
1.  High Courts                                     :   Government of India Act 1935
2.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)        :   Constitution of India
3.  State Public Service Commissions (SPSCs)       :   Constitution of India
4.  Parliament                                      :   Constitution of India
5.  NITI Aayog                                     :   Constitution of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) Only 2 and 4
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) Only 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

High Courts, while having their roots in pre-independence legislation, are fundamentally defined and structured by the Constitution of India, not solely by the Government of India Act 1935. The UPSC and SPSCs are explicitly established by the Constitution of India.  Parliament is also a constitutional body. NITI Aayog is a post-independence body established by a Government resolution; it's not a constitutional body. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Power/Function                                    Source/Basis
1.  Appointment of Governors                        :   Article 155
2.  Dissolution of the Lok Sabha                    :   Article 85
3.  Granting Pardons                               :   Article 72
4.  Addressing Joint Sittings of Parliament          :   Article 87
5.  Appointment of Prime Minister                   :   Convention


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each of the five pairs accurately reflects a power or function of the President of India and its constitutional or conventional basis.  The President appoints Governors under Article 155, dissolves the Lok Sabha under Article 85, grants pardons under Article 72, addresses joint sittings of Parliament under Article 87, and the appointment of the Prime Minister is based on well-established convention, although not explicitly stated in the constitution.  All options except (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual knowledge of specific constitutional articles and the understanding of the conventional aspects of presidential powers.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Power/Jurisdiction              Associated Characteristic
1.  Original Jurisdiction                          :   Disputes between the Centre and States
2.  Appellate Jurisdiction                         :   Appeals from High Courts
3.  Advisory Jurisdiction                          :   Binding on the Government
4.  Writ Jurisdiction                             :   Protection of Fundamental Rights
5.  Power of Judicial Review                      :   Declaration of laws as unconstitutional


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first four pairs are correctly matched.  The Supreme Court possesses original jurisdiction in specific matters, including disputes between the Union and States.  It has appellate jurisdiction over cases from High Courts.  It possesses writ jurisdiction to protect fundamental rights.  Its power of judicial review allows it to declare laws unconstitutional. However, the advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is *not* binding on the government; its opinions are merely advisory.  Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair. Options (a) and (d) are also incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept/Doctrine                         Supreme Court's Application
1.  Doctrine of Severability                       :   Used to uphold parts of a law deemed constitutional
2.  Doctrine of Eclipse                             :   Applies when a pre-constitutional law is inconsistent with a fundamental right.
3.  Doctrine of Prospective Overruling             :   Allows the court to modify the impact of a prior decision.
4.  Doctrine of Harmonious Construction           :   Interprets laws to avoid conflict and maintain consistency.
5.  Doctrine of Basic Structure                    :   Limits the amending power of the Parliament.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs represent accurate descriptions of legal doctrines and their application by the Supreme Court of India.  The Doctrine of Severability allows the court to separate constitutional parts of a law from unconstitutional ones. The Doctrine of Eclipse explains the status of pre-constitutional laws that are inconsistent with fundamental rights, rendering them temporarily inoperative.  The Doctrine of Prospective Overruling allows the court to limit the retrospective effects of its decisions. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction aims to interpret different laws in a way that avoids contradictions. The Doctrine of Basic Structure limits the Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution.  Therefore, option (b) is correct, while other options incorrectly exclude correctly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Professional Category                     Privilege/Restriction in Supreme Court
1.  Senior Advocates                              :   Cannot directly file documents
2.  Advocates-on-Record                           :   Can file documents and act for parties
3.  Other Advocates                               :   Can appear and argue but not file documents

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the privileges and restrictions on different categories of advocates practicing before the Supreme Court of India. Senior Advocates require an Advocate-on-Record to file documents. Advocates-on-Record have the primary responsibility for filing documents and representing parties.  Other Advocates can argue cases but cannot independently file documents.  Therefore, option (c) is correct.  The other options are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include an incorrect pairing.  This question assesses knowledge of the legal profession's structure within the Supreme Court.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Subject/Area                                    Constitutional Provision/Article
1.  State Government Loan Consent                   :   Part XI
2.  Appointment of High Court Judges               :   Article 217
3.  Definition of Citizenship                       :   Part II
4.  Emergency Provisions                           :   Part XVIII
5.  Languages in the Eighth Schedule               :   Article 343


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Constitution's provisions regarding State Government loan consent are found in Part XI (dealing with relations between the Union and the States).  The appointment of High Court Judges is covered under Article 217.  The definition of Citizenship is outlined in Part II.  Emergency Provisions are detailed in Part XVIII.  Finally, Article 343 deals with the official languages. Therefore, option (d) is correct; the other options incorrectly exclude correctly matched pairs.  This tests knowledge of the structure and content of the Indian Constitution.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment Act                   Significant impact on the Supreme Court
1.  First Amendment Act, 1951                     :   Limited the scope of judicial review
2.  42nd Amendment Act, 1976                     :   Curtailed the power of judicial review
3.  99th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2014       :   Declared NJAC unconstitutional
4.  30th Amendment Act, 1972                     :   Removed monetary limits on civil appeals
5.  Thirty-Eighth Amendment Act, 1975            :   Modified emergency powers of the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The 99th Amendment Act did indeed declare the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act unconstitutional.  The 30th Amendment removed monetary limits on civil appeals to the Supreme Court. The Thirty-Eighth Amendment Act modified the emergency powers of the President, indirectly influencing the Supreme Court's role during emergencies. However, the First and 42nd Amendments had a more complex relationship with judicial review, with some provisions limiting its scope while others did not have a direct impact.  Option (b) is therefore the most accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly matched pairs, or the exclusion of correctly matched pairs.  This question tests understanding of the evolution of the Supreme Court's powers through constitutional amendments.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on High Courts and, in some cases, their relationship with the Supreme Court and other governmental bodies.  Note that some questions may utilize information dispersed across the provided text, requiring synthesis of knowledge.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   High Court Feature                     |  Specific Detail
1.  Jurisdictional Scope                 |  Co-terminus with State territory
2.  Judge Appointment                  |  President, after consultation with CJI and Governor
3.  Power of Judicial Review             | Explicitly conferred by Articles 13 and 226
4.  Number of High Courts in India (2019) |  25
5.  Language of Proceedings              |  English


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The territorial jurisdiction of a High Court is explicitly stated to be co-terminous with the state's territory. The appointment of High Court judges involves the President, after consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and the Governor of the state. Articles 13 and 226 explicitly confer the power of judicial review on High Courts. In 2019, there were 25 High Courts in India.  Finally, the official language of High Court proceedings is English.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   High Court Characteristic          |  Illustrative Example/Detail
1.  Appellate Jurisdiction             |  Hears appeals from Subordinate Courts
2.  Supervisory Jurisdiction           |  Can call for returns from subordinate courts
3.  Administrative Control            |  Consults with the Governor on District Judge appointments
4.  Court of Record                    |  Power to punish for contempt of court
5.  Power of Review                    |  Can review its own judgments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect characteristics of High Courts in India.  The High Court's appellate jurisdiction encompasses appeals from subordinate courts.  Its supervisory jurisdiction allows it to oversee subordinate courts, including calling for returns.  The High Court's administrative control extends to consulting with the Governor on judicial appointments. As a court of record, it possesses the power to punish for contempt.  Finally, although not explicitly stated as a constitutional power, High Courts do have the power to review their own judgments. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. With reference to the High Courts in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Judge                        |  Appointment Authority
1.  Chief Justice                       |  President, in consultation with CJI and Governor
2.  Additional Judge                    |  President, for a term not exceeding two years
3.  Acting Chief Justice                |  President, when the office of the Chief Justice is vacant or the Chief Justice is absent/unable to perform duties
4.  Ad hoc Judge                       |  President, as deemed necessary to augment judicial strength


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The President appoints the Chief Justice of a High Court after consulting with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor.  Additional judges are appointed by the President for temporary periods. Acting Chief Justices are appointed to fill temporary vacancies or absences. The President can also appoint ad hoc judges as needed to handle increased workload.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  High Court Power/Jurisdiction         |  Constitutional Basis/Article
1.  Writ Jurisdiction                    |  Article 226
2.  Appellate Jurisdiction in Civil Cases |  Articles 133 and 227
3.  Supervisory Jurisdiction             |  Inherent power, not explicitly mentioned in a specific article.
4. Original Jurisdiction                | Articles 226 and 227
5. Power to Punish for Contempt      |  Inherent power as a Court of Record


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While High Courts possess original, appellate, and supervisory jurisdiction, and the power to punish for contempt, the precise constitutional basis isn't always a single, explicit article. Article 226 clearly grants writ jurisdiction.  Articles 133 outlines the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction over High Courts, while Article 227 covers the High Courts' power over subordinate courts, which implicitly supports its appellate function.  The supervisory jurisdiction is an inherent power, not tied to one specific article.  Original jurisdiction is supported by Articles 226 and 227 but is not fully defined in a single article.  Similarly, the contempt power stems from its status as a Court of Record, an inherent power.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are definitively and completely matched to their constitutional grounding.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   High Court Related Entity/Concept    |   Related Detail/Characteristic
1.  High Court Legal Services Committee | Located within the High Court
2.  Attorney General                   | Can appear in High Court proceedings
3.  Election Petitions                  | Tried by High Courts
4.  Second Appeal                       | Question of law only
5.  Subordinate Judiciary              | Supervised by High Courts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The High Court Legal Services Committee functions within the High Court.  The Attorney General, as the highest law officer, can appear before the High Court.  High Courts hear election petitions.  Second appeals to High Courts generally concern only questions of law.  Finally, High Courts supervise the subordinate judiciary within their jurisdiction. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.

These examples demonstrate the creation of difficult, factual recall-based multiple-choice questions that require a deep understanding of the Indian judicial system and its constitutional framework, aligning with the UPSC examination style and difficulty level.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, challenging the examinee to accurately recall the specifics.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution       Provision Related to the Supreme Court
1. Article 124                      :   Establishment of the Supreme Court
2. Article 137                      :   Power of the Supreme Court to review its own judgments
3. Article 143                      :   Advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
4. Article 32                       :   Power of the Supreme Court to issue writs for fundamental rights
5. Article 226                      :   Power of High Courts to issue writs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 124 of the Indian Constitution deals with the establishment and constitution of the Supreme Court of India, outlining its structure and composition.  Article 137 explicitly grants the Supreme Court the power to review its own judgments and orders. This inherent power allows the court to rectify errors or inconsistencies in its previous decisions, ensuring the consistent application of law and justice. Article 143 pertains to the advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, allowing the President to seek its opinion on questions of law or fact of public importance.  Article 32 empowers the Supreme Court to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights, a crucial aspect of its role in protecting citizens' liberties.  Article 226, however, relates to the power of High Courts to issue writs, not the Supreme Court. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of Article 226 is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of constitutional provisions related to the Supreme Court.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Judgement             Legal Concept Affected
1. Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973)  :   Doctrine of Basic Structure
2. Golak Nath Case (1967)            :   Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights
3. Minerva Mills Case (1980)         :   Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights
4. Shankari Prasad Case (1951)       :   Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights
5.  Bommai Case (1994)               :   Federalism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) is a landmark judgement that established the "basic structure doctrine," which limits Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  The Golak Nath case (1967) initially held that Parliament could not amend Fundamental Rights, a position later overturned.  The Minerva Mills case (1980) reaffirmed the basic structure doctrine, further clarifying the limits on Parliament's amending power concerning Fundamental Rights. The Shankari Prasad case (1951) initially upheld Parliament's unlimited power to amend the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, a position later challenged and modified. The S.R. Bommai case (1994) significantly impacted the understanding of federalism in India, particularly concerning the relationship between the Union and State governments.  All five pairs correctly match a Supreme Court judgment with a significant legal concept it impacted.  The inclusion of seemingly similar cases (Golak Nath and Minerva Mills) and the potentially confusing inclusion of the Shankari Prasad case aim to test the candidate's nuanced understanding of the evolution of constitutional law in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Power of the Supreme Court        Constitutional Article
1. Original Jurisdiction             :   Article 131
2. Appellate Jurisdiction           :   Article 132
3. Special Leave to Appeal          :   Article 136
4. Review of Judgments              :   Article 137
5. Advisory Jurisdiction             :   Article 143

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Article 131 of the Indian Constitution outlines the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, specifying the types of cases it can hear directly without prior appeal. Article 132 details the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction, covering appeals from High Courts in specific circumstances.  Article 136 grants the Supreme Court the power to grant special leave to appeal, a crucial mechanism for ensuring access to justice. Article 137 allows the Supreme Court to review its own judgments and orders, a power essential for maintaining consistency and rectifying errors. Article 143 confers advisory jurisdiction on the Supreme Court, enabling the President to seek its opinion on matters of law or fact. Thus, all five pairs are correctly matched. The options are designed to test the candidate's in-depth understanding of the Supreme Court's diverse powers as enshrined in the Constitution and to distinguish between its different types of jurisdiction.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court’s Power           Description
1. Court of Record                  :   Power to punish for contempt of court
2. Judicial Review                   :   Power to examine constitutionality of laws
3. Advisory Jurisdiction             :   Power to give opinions on matters referred by the President
4.  Special Leave to Appeal         :   Discretionary power to hear appeals from any court
5.  Power of Review                   :   Power to review its own judgements


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's status as a "Court of Record" grants it the power to maintain records of its proceedings and punish for contempt of court. Judicial review is the fundamental power of the Supreme Court to assess the constitutionality of laws and government actions. The advisory jurisdiction allows the Supreme Court to offer opinions to the President on matters of public importance. Special Leave to Appeal provides the Supreme Court with the discretionary power to hear appeals from any court or tribunal in India. The power of review enables the Supreme Court to re-examine its own judgments, ensuring consistency and fairness.  All five pairs accurately describe the powers of the Supreme Court. The question's design is intended to thoroughly evaluate the candidate's knowledge of the Supreme Court's wide-ranging authority and its functions within the Indian legal system.  The inclusion of all five key powers makes simple guessing highly unlikely, requiring detailed knowledge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Body                 Function/Power
1. Parliament                       :   Establishes the Supreme Court
2. President                         :   Appoints Judges of the Supreme Court
3. Supreme Court                    :   Interprets the Constitution
4. Council of Ministers              :   Salaries of Supreme Court Judges are determined by this body
5.  Union Public Service Commission:   Consults with the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Parliament, as the supreme legislative body, establishes the Supreme Court through constitutional provisions. The President, as the head of state, appoints the judges of the Supreme Court, usually following the recommendations of a collegium. The Supreme Court, as the apex court, interprets the Constitution, providing definitive interpretations of its provisions.  However, the salaries of Supreme Court judges are determined by Parliament, not the Council of Ministers, although the Council of Ministers is involved in the budgetary process. The UPSC does not routinely consult with the Supreme Court in its day-to-day functioning.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of the Council of Ministers and the UPSC as distractors tests the candidate's understanding of the precise roles and responsibilities of each institution concerning the Supreme Court.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution      Associated Right
1. Article 14                      : Right to Equality
2. Article 17                      : Abolition of Untouchability
3. Article 19                      : Right to Freedom
4. Article 21                      : Right to Life and Personal Liberty
5. Article 25                      : Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and Propagation of Religion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are correctly matched.  Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Article 17 abolishes untouchability. Article 19 guarantees various freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which has been interpreted broadly by the Supreme Court to include various other rights.  Article 25 guarantees freedom of conscience and the free profession, practice, and propagation of religion.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all five pairs is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Writ                                 Purpose
1. Habeas Corpus                     :  To forbid a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction
2. Mandamus                           : To command a public official to perform their duty
3. Prohibition                        : To transfer a case from a lower court to a higher court
4. Certiorari                          : To inquire into the legality of a claim to a public office
5. Quo Warranto                      : To secure the release of a person unlawfully detained

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  Mandamus is indeed a writ that commands a public official to perform their duty. Quo Warranto is used to inquire into the legality of a person's claim to a public office.  The other pairs are incorrect. Habeas Corpus secures the release of someone unlawfully detained; Prohibition prevents a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction; and Certiorari transfers a case or quashes an order of a lower court.  Therefore, option (b) is correct, while options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the purpose of at least one writ.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body               Primary Function
1. Union Public Service Commission :  Advises the President on matters of national security
2. Comptroller and Auditor General :  Audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments
3. Election Commission               :  Conducts elections to the State Legislative Assemblies
4. Finance Commission                 :  Recommends the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States
5. National Human Rights Commission:  Investigates human rights violations in private sector only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments. The Election Commission conducts elections to various bodies, including State Legislative Assemblies. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and the States. The UPSC advises the President on appointments and other matters related to civil services, not national security. The NHRC investigates human rights violations by both state and non-state actors. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly match at least one constitutional body with its function.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment Act                      Provision
1. 73rd Amendment Act                 :  Created the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC)
2. 74th Amendment Act                 :  Established Municipalities
3. 99th Amendment Act                :  Established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
4. 42nd Amendment Act                :  Added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution
5. First Amendment Act                :  Amended the Directive Principles of State Policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The 74th Amendment Act deals with Municipalities. The 42nd Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The other pairs are incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act deals with Panchayats, not the NJAC; the 99th Amendment Act did not establish the NHRC, and the First Amendment Act did not amend the Directive Principles. Therefore, option (a) is correct. The other options include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Power of the President             Source in the Constitution
1. Ordinance-making power           : Article 124
2. Pardoning power                   : Article 72
3. Appointment of Governors          : Article 153
4. Dissolution of Lok Sabha         : Article 85
5. Appointment of Supreme Court Judges: Article 124

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Article 72 grants the President the power to pardon. Article 153 deals with the appointment of Governors. Article 124 deals with the appointment of Supreme Court judges. The other pairs are incorrect. Article 123, not Article 124, deals with the President's ordinance-making power; Article 85, not Article 85, deals with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer. The other options include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Writ                       Characteristic
1. Habeas Corpus                     : Issued only against private individuals
2. Mandamus                           : Cannot be issued against the President of India
3. Prohibition                        :  Can be issued against administrative authorities
4. Certiorari                          : Primarily a preventive remedy
5. Quo Warranto                      :  Can be sought only by the aggrieved person


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Mandamus cannot be issued against the President of India. The other pairs are incorrect. Habeas Corpus is issued against those detaining another person, both public and private; Prohibition is issued against judicial or quasi-judicial authorities, not administrative ones; Certiorari is both preventive and curative; and Quo Warranto can be sought by any interested person, not just the aggrieved one. Therefore, option (a) is correct while other options incorrectly match at least one characteristic with a writ.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment           Key Feature
1. First Amendment Act                :  Introduced Fundamental Rights
2. Fourth Amendment Act               :  Added the Ninth Schedule
3. Twenty-fourth Amendment Act      :   Curtailed the power of judicial review
4. Forty-second Amendment Act        :  Added Fundamental Duties
5. Ninety-ninth Amendment Act        :  Introduced the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Fourth Amendment Act added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. The Forty-second Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties. The other pairs are incorrect. The First Amendment Act did not introduce Fundamental Rights (they were already present in the original Constitution); the Twenty-fourth Amendment Act did not curtail the power of judicial review; and the Ninety-ninth Amendment Act related to the NJAC, which was later struck down. Therefore, option (a) is correct, while options (b), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article of the Constitution        Provision
1. Article 32                          :  Right to Constitutional Remedies
2. Article 226                         :  Writ Jurisdiction of High Courts
3. Article 227                         :  Supervisory Jurisdiction of High Courts
4. Article 245                         :  Extent of Laws Made by Parliament and State Legislatures
5. Article 356                         :  President's Rule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies. Article 226 grants writ jurisdiction to High Courts. Article 227 grants supervisory jurisdiction to High Courts over subordinate courts. Article 245 defines the extent of laws made by Parliament and State Legislatures. Article 356 allows for President's Rule.  Therefore, option (b) is correct, while options (a), (c), and (d) omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                             Appointment Authority
1.  Judges of the Supreme Court     : Chief Justice of India
2.  Judges of the High Court        :  President of India
3.  District Judges                  :  Governor of the State
4.  Acting Chief Justice of India   : President of India
5.  Members of the UPSC             : Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The President appoints High Court judges. The President appoints the Acting Chief Justice of India.  The other pairs are incorrect. Supreme Court judges are appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of India; District Judges are appointed by the Governor in consultation with the High Court; and UPSC members are appointed by the President.  Therefore, only option (a) is correct.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                  Description
1.  Federalism                              :  Power is concentrated in the center
2.  Judicial Review                         :  Power to question the wisdom of laws
3.  Parliamentary System                    :  Executive is responsible to the legislature
4.  Basic Structure Doctrine                 :  Limits the amending power of the Parliament
5.  Consolidated Fund of India              :  Receives all tax revenues


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. In a parliamentary system, the executive is responsible to the legislature. The basic structure doctrine limits the amending power of Parliament. The Consolidated Fund of India receives all tax revenues. The other pairs are incorrect. Federalism involves a division of power between the center and states; Judicial Review involves the power to examine the constitutionality of laws, not their wisdom. Therefore, option (b) is correct.  Other options contain at least one incorrect pairing.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Office                                         Incumbent (as of a specific date in the past)
1. President of India                             :  Dr. Rajendra Prasad
2. Chief Justice of India                          :  Gajendragadkar
3. Governor of Gujarat                            :  Jagmohan
4. Attorney General of India                      :  A.R. Kidwai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Dr. Rajendra Prasad served as the first President of India.  Gajendragadkar held the office of Chief Justice of India at a point in the past.  Jagmohan served as the Governor of Gujarat at a specific time.  While A.R. Kidwai was an Attorney General of India, pinpointing a specific past incumbency requires further information not provided here and hence cannot be ascertained as being 100% correct. The other options are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair (4) or omit correctly matched pairs. Option (a) only includes the President, omitting other correct matches. Option (b) omits the Governor of Gujarat. Option (d) incorrectly includes the Attorney General pair.  The question tests factual recall of individuals who held specific high-profile positions within the Indian government and judiciary.  Understanding the historical context of these appointments is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of Indian governance.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article                Provision Related To
1. Article 143                             :  Advisory Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
2. Article 32                              :  Enforcement of Fundamental Rights by the Supreme Court
3. Article 226                             :  Writ Jurisdiction of High Courts
4. Article 154                             :  Executive power of the Governor


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Article 143 of the Indian Constitution deals with the power of the President to consult the Supreme Court on legal matters, hence its advisory jurisdiction. Article 32 grants the Supreme Court the power to enforce fundamental rights. Article 226 grants the High Courts the power to issue writs, including those for enforcing fundamental rights.  Article 154 vests the executive power of the state in the Governor. All the pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of key constitutional articles and their respective functions within the Indian legal framework.  Knowing these articles is crucial for understanding the distribution of powers and responsibilities within the Indian government.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Power of the President of India          Description
1. Pardoning power                           :  Extends to all offences against Union law
2. Suspensive veto                           :  Can delay a bill but not permanently reject it
3. Absolute veto                             :  Can completely reject a bill
4. Pocket veto                               :   Can refuse to sign a bill without explanation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The President of India possesses the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or remit punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offence. This power extends to offences against Union laws. The suspensive veto allows the President to return a bill to Parliament for reconsideration, delaying its enactment but not permanently rejecting it. The absolute veto allows the President to completely reject a bill. The pocket veto allows the President to neither sign nor return a bill, effectively killing it without explanation. All four pairs accurately describe powers held by the President. Other options are incomplete, failing to account for all the correctly matched pairs. This question tests the understanding of the President's legislative powers and their nuances, emphasizing the distinctions between different types of vetoes.  This knowledge is essential for a complete grasp of the Indian presidential system's checks and balances.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Judgement                                 Key Feature
1. Kesavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala :  Established the doctrine of basic structure
2. Golak Nath vs. State of Punjab          :  Parliament cannot amend Fundamental Rights
3. SP Gupta vs. President of India         :  Deals with the primacy of the Chief Justice in judicial appointments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case established the doctrine of basic structure, limiting Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. The Golak Nath case initially held that Parliament could not amend fundamental rights, though this was later overturned. The SP Gupta case significantly addressed the role of the Chief Justice of India and the collegium system in the appointment of judges.  All three pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they fail to include all the correctly paired judgements and their key features.  This question tests the understanding of landmark Supreme Court judgements and their impact on Indian constitutional law.  Knowledge of these cases is crucial for analysing the evolution of judicial interpretations of fundamental rights and the judiciary's role in the Indian political system.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Authority                                 Can Organize Lok Adalats?
1. Panchayat Committees                       :   Yes
2. Taluk Legal Services Committee            :   Yes
3. District Authority                         :   Yes
4. High Court Legal Services Committee      :   Yes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Lok Adalats are informal dispute resolution mechanisms established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.  Various authorities at different levels, including Panchayat Committees, Taluk Legal Services Committees, District Authorities, and High Court Legal Services Committees, are empowered to organize Lok Adalats.  All four pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they omit one or more of these correctly matched authorities. This question tests the understanding of the organizational structure and reach of Lok Adalats in India.  The ability to identify the various bodies involved in their organization demonstrates a working knowledge of the Indian legal aid system and its decentralized approach to dispute resolution.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    High Court Feature                      Description
1. Original Jurisdiction                    :  Includes matters of admiralty and contempt
2. Writ Jurisdiction                       :   Concurrent with Supreme Court's writ jurisdiction under Article 32
3. Appellate Jurisdiction                   :  Appeals against judgements of subordinate courts
4. Supervisory Jurisdiction                  :  Control over subordinate courts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

High Courts in India possess original jurisdiction, hearing cases in the first instance, including those related to admiralty and contempt of court.  Their writ jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the Supreme Court (under Article 32) for enforcing fundamental rights, but the High Court's jurisdiction is broader.  High Courts have appellate jurisdiction, hearing appeals from subordinate courts within their territorial jurisdiction. They also exercise supervisory jurisdiction, overseeing the functioning of subordinate courts.  All four pairs accurately describe aspects of High Court jurisdiction. Other options omit at least one correctly matched pair. This question assesses knowledge of the different types of jurisdiction exercised by High Courts, highlighting the distinctions between original, appellate, writ, and supervisory powers.  This understanding is fundamental to understanding the structure and function of the Indian judicial system.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Governor:**

    Statement                                  True or False
1.  The Governor is appointed by the President. : True
2.  The Governor can be removed by the President. : True
3.  The Governor's emoluments are determined by the State Legislature. : False


Which of the statements given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Governor of a state is appointed by the President of India. The President also holds the power to remove a Governor from office.  However, the emoluments and allowances of the Governor are determined by Parliament, not the State Legislature. Therefore, statement 3 is false. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false statement (3) or exclude the true statements (1 and 2). This question tests the understanding of the appointment, removal, and financial aspects of the Governor's office, highlighting the relationship between the center and the states within the Indian federal structure.  This knowledge is critical for grasping the dynamics of Indian federalism.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Supreme Court Power                     Description
1.  Original Jurisdiction                   :  Exclusive in disputes between the Centre and States
2.  Appellate Jurisdiction                  :  Includes appeals from High Courts in constitutional matters
3.  Advisory Jurisdiction                   :   President can seek opinions, but the Court can refuse
4.  Power to Punish for Contempt           :   Maintains the Court's authority and dignity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court possesses exclusive original jurisdiction in disputes involving the Centre and States.  Its appellate jurisdiction encompasses appeals from High Courts on constitutional questions and other matters. The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction allows the President to seek its opinion, but the Court is not obligated to provide it in certain circumstances.  The Court's power to punish for contempt is a vital tool for maintaining its authority. All four pairs accurately reflect powers of the Supreme Court.  The other options are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the knowledge of the Supreme Court's extensive jurisdiction and powers, which are crucial for understanding its role as the highest court of appeal and guardian of the Constitution.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment Act           Significant Provision
1. First Amendment Act, 1951              :  Added the Ninth Schedule
2. Seventh Amendment Act, 1956           :  Reorganized states into 14 states and 6 union territories
3. Ninth Amendment Act, 1960             :  Facilitated the cession of Berubari Union to Pakistan
4. Ninety-Ninth Amendment Act, 2014     :  Established NJAC, later declared unconstitutional


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The First Amendment Act added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, protecting certain laws from judicial review. The Seventh Amendment Act significantly reorganized the states and union territories of India. The Ninth Amendment Act facilitated the transfer of Berubari Union to Pakistan. The Ninety-Ninth Amendment Act attempted to establish the NJAC, but this was subsequently declared unconstitutional.  All four pairs accurately reflect the significant provisions of the respective Constitutional Amendment Acts. The other options are incomplete, leaving out at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests factual knowledge of significant constitutional amendments and their impact on India's political and administrative landscape. Understanding the consequences of these amendments is crucial for comprehending the evolution of Indian constitutional law.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Institution                          Feature
1. Supreme Court                             :  Highest court of appeal in India
2. High Court                                :  Court of record
3. Lok Adalats                               :  Based on compromise or settlement
4. Election Tribunals                       :  Appeals to High Courts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal in India, having final authority in legal matters. High Courts are courts of record, meaning their judgements and proceedings have inherent authority and are admissible as evidence. Lok Adalats are alternative dispute resolution mechanisms aimed at achieving settlements through compromise. Election Tribunals handle election-related disputes, with appeals lying to the relevant High Courts.  All four pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one of these correctly matched pairs. This question tests the understanding of the structure and functions of various legal institutions within the Indian legal system and their interrelationships.  This knowledge is vital for understanding the multiple pathways of justice available to citizens.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chief Justice of India                     Action Taken
1. Justice H. L. Dattu                       :   Ordered the constitution of a Special Bench called ‘Social Justice Bench’
2. Justice K. G. Balakrishnan              :   Initiated a National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) program
3. Justice R. M. Lodha                       :   Oversaw the implementation of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act
4. Justice Y. K. Sabharwal                  :   Established a committee on judicial reforms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Justice H. L. Dattu is correctly matched with the establishment of a 'Social Justice Bench.'  This bench was created to address cases related to social justice issues, demonstrating a proactive approach towards crucial societal matters.  The other options present plausible distractors. Justice K. G. Balakrishnan's tenure saw significant advancements in legal aid through NALSA, but he didn't specifically order the creation of a 'Social Justice Bench'.  Similarly, while Justice R. M. Lodha played a crucial role in judicial reform, including the NJAC, the question specifically asks about the creation of a Social Justice Bench.  Finally, Justice Y. K. Sabharwal's contributions to judicial reform are significant, but he is not known for specifically establishing a 'Social Justice Bench.'  The key here is the precise action – "Ordered the constitution of a Special Bench called ‘Social Justice Bench’" – which uniquely identifies Justice Dattu's contribution.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Case                     Legal Issue Addressed
1.  Indra Sawhney v. Union of India       :   Validity of Mandal Commission recommendations
2.  KM Nanavati v. State of Bombay       :   Abolition of Privy Council appeals
3.  Naz Foundation v. Government of NCT of Delhi :   Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code
4.  Shreya Singhal v. Union of India      :   Freedom of speech and expression on the internet

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Indra Sawhney v. Union of India directly addressed the constitutional validity of the Mandal Commission's recommendations for reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs).  Naz Foundation v. Government of NCT of Delhi directly challenged Section 377 of the IPC, which criminalized homosexual acts. Shreya Singhal v. Union of India concerned the freedom of speech and expression in the context of internet regulation.  The KM Nanavati case, while significant, dealt with the jurisdiction of the courts in a specific criminal case and not with the abolition of Privy Council appeals.  That issue was addressed through constitutional amendments and not a single Supreme Court case.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of the Nanavati case acts as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of landmark Supreme Court judgments.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Writ                                   Meaning/Purpose
1.  Habeas Corpus                        :   To quash an order of a lower court
2.  Mandamus                              :   To compel performance of a public duty
3.  Certiorari                            :   To bring a case before a higher court for review
4.  Quo Warranto                          :  To inquire into the legality of holding a public office

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mandamus is correctly paired with its purpose of compelling the performance of a public duty. Certiorari is accurately described as a writ used to bring a case before a higher court for review. Quo Warranto correctly identifies the purpose of inquiring into the legality of holding public office.  Habeas Corpus, however, is not correctly matched with its description.  While it can lead to the review of a detention, its primary purpose is to ensure that a person is not unlawfully detained and to have the person brought before the court. Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The inclusion of an incorrect description of Habeas Corpus serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's in-depth understanding of the writs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Power                        Constitutional Article
1.  Granting pardons                     :   Article 72
2.  Appointing State Election Commissioner :   Article 243K
3.  Dissolving the State Legislative Assembly:  Article 356
4.  Reserved powers for certain States    :   Article 371

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 correctly outlines the Governor's power to grant pardons. Article 243K correctly details the Governor's role in appointing the State Election Commissioner. Article 371 correctly addresses the Governor's reserved powers for certain States.  However, the Governor does not dissolve the State Legislative Assembly under Article 356; that power rests with the President during the proclamation of President's Rule. This is a key distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the constitutional provisions related to the Governor's powers.  The correct matching is thus 1, 2, and 4 only.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution             Subject Matter
1. Article 231                               :   Establishment of common High Court for two or more states
2. Article 32                                 :   Right to Constitutional Remedies
3. Article 370                               :   Special status of Jammu and Kashmir (prior to 2019)
4. Article 368                               :   Power of Parliament to amend the Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 231 correctly specifies the power to establish a common High Court. Article 32 accurately describes the right to constitutional remedies. Article 370, before its revocation in 2019, correctly granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 368 correctly outlines the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  There are no incorrect pairings in this question, making it a test of the candidate's comprehensive understanding of crucial constitutional articles.  The question's design is to test recall of specific articles and their associated subject matters.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chairperson of National Commission        Tenure
1. Kunwar Singh                          :   2004 - 2007
2. Urmila Singh                           :   2007 - 2010
3. Rameshwar Oraon                        :   2010 - 2013
4. Nand Kumar Sai                         :   2017 - till date

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The pairs 1, 2, and 3 correctly match the chairpersons of a National Commission with their respective tenures.  However, the tenure of Nand Kumar Sai is not correctly mentioned. The provided information lacks the specification of which National Commission these chairpersons headed.  This is a crucial piece of missing information that makes the fourth pair potentially incorrect, serving as a major distractor.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 can be confirmed as correctly matched based on the provided data.  The ambiguity regarding the specific National Commission is a key factor in the difficulty of this question.

**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article/Concept          Related Constitutional Provision/Concept
1.  Article 32                               :   Guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of Fundamental Rights
2.  Right to Property                       :   No longer a Fundamental Right after the 44th Amendment Act
3.  Basic Structure Doctrine                :   First articulated in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)
4.  Article 19(1)                            :   Establishes freedom of speech and expression as a Fundamental Right
5.  Fundamental Rights                     :   Protected from violation by statutes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:

1. **Article 32 and Fundamental Rights:** Article 32 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that guarantees the right to constitutional remedies.  This means citizens can directly approach the Supreme Court if their Fundamental Rights are violated. The Supreme Court has the power to issue writs (orders) to protect these rights. This is a cornerstone of the Indian judicial system, ensuring the effectiveness of Fundamental Rights.

2. **Right to Property:** The Right to Property was initially a Fundamental Right under Article 31. However, the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed this right from Part III (Fundamental Rights) of the Constitution and made it a legal right under Article 300-A. This change reflects a shift in the government's approach to property rights, emphasizing social and economic justice.

3. **Basic Structure Doctrine and Kesavananda Bharati:** The Basic Structure Doctrine is a crucial legal principle in India.  It emerged from the landmark judgment in *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973). This case established that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution (under Article 368), it cannot alter the basic or essential features of the Constitution.  This doctrine safeguards the fundamental framework of the Indian Constitution.

4. **Article 19(1) and Freedom of Speech:** Article 19(1) of the Constitution guarantees several fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech and expression. This is a vital right in a democracy, allowing citizens to express their opinions freely, participate in public discourse, and hold the government accountable. However, this freedom is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, security, etc.

5. **Fundamental Rights and Statutes:** Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and are considered the most important rights of Indian citizens.  These rights are protected against violation by any law or action that is inconsistent with them. If a statute infringes upon a Fundamental Right, the judiciary can declare it invalid.  This reflects the supremacy of the Constitution and the judiciary's role in upholding the rule of law.


The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of several key legal principles and constitutional provisions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                      Significant Constitutional Amendment
1. 1951                                      :   First Amendment Act
2. 1976                                      :   Forty-second Amendment Act
3. 1978                                      :   Forty-fourth Amendment Act
4. 1985                                      :   Fifty-second Amendment Act
5. 1992                                      :    Seventy-third and Seventy-fourth Amendment Acts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Each pair links a year to a significant constitutional amendment act passed in that year.  The amendments represent diverse aspects of constitutional development, reflecting evolving political priorities and judicial interpretations.

1. **1951 - First Amendment Act:** This amendment primarily addressed concerns raised by the judiciary regarding the scope of Fundamental Rights, particularly freedom of speech and expression. It introduced reasonable restrictions on these rights.

2. **1976 - Forty-second Amendment Act:**  This is a landmark amendment often referred to as the "Mini-Constitution." It introduced significant changes, including the addition of "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity" to the Preamble, reflecting the changing social and political landscape of the time.  It also made several changes to Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.

3. **1978 - Forty-fourth Amendment Act:** This amendment sought to restore some of the balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, which had been altered by the 42nd Amendment.  Significantly, it also removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights.

4. **1985 - Fifty-second Amendment Act:** This amendment introduced the Anti-Defection Law (Tenth Schedule), aiming to curb political defections and enhance the stability of governments. This amendment addressed a major challenge to the functioning of parliamentary democracy.

5. **1992 - Seventy-third and Seventy-fourth Amendment Acts:** These amendments are crucial for local governance in India. The 73rd Amendment established the three-tier Panchayati Raj system at the village, intermediate, and district levels, while the 74th Amendment established a similar system of urban local governments.


The other options are incorrect because they fail to include all the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive knowledge of Indian constitutional history.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the significance of different amendment acts.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Landmark Supreme Court Case             Legal Principle Established/Affirmed
1.  Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980) :   Doctrine of proportionality in sentencing
2.  Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) :  Basic Structure Doctrine
3.  Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980)   :   Limits on amending power under Article 368
4.  Golaknath v. State of Punjab (1967)      :   Parliament's inability to amend Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Each pair connects a landmark Supreme Court case to a significant legal principle it established or affirmed. These cases are cornerstones of Indian constitutional law, shaping the interpretation and application of fundamental rights, amending powers, and judicial review.

1.  **Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980):** This case dealt with the death penalty. The Supreme Court held that the death penalty should only be awarded in the "rarest of rare" cases,  introducing a degree of proportionality in capital punishment.  This decision significantly impacted the application of the death penalty, limiting its use to exceptional circumstances.

2.  **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973):** This landmark case introduced the "Basic Structure Doctrine." The court ruled that the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution (Article 368) is not unlimited and that certain fundamental aspects, or the basic structure, of the Constitution cannot be altered.  This significantly limits the scope of Parliament's amending power and enhances the judiciary's role in constitutional interpretation.

3.  **Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980):** This case further reinforced the Basic Structure Doctrine. The court upheld the limits on Parliament's amending power, emphasizing the need to protect the core elements of the Constitution.  This reiterated the judiciary's role in safeguarding the basic structure of the Constitution.

4.  **Golaknath v. State of Punjab (1967):** This case dealt with the scope of Parliament's amending power. The Court held that Parliament could not amend Fundamental Rights. This decision was later overturned by the 24th and 25th Amendment Acts, but it remains important in understanding the evolution of judicial interpretations regarding amending powers.


The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more of these crucial cases and their associated legal principles. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant Supreme Court judgments and their impact on constitutional law.  It demands not only factual recall but also an understanding of the evolution of judicial thought.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                                   Supreme Court Judgement/Act
1.  Judicial Review                              :   Kesavananda Bharati Case
2.  Basic Structure Doctrine                      :   Minerva Mills Case
3.  Right to Privacy                              :   Puttaswamy Case
4.  Public Interest Litigation (PIL)             :   S.P. Gupta Case
5.  Amendment of the Constitution (Article 368) :   First Amendment Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's ability to link important legal concepts to specific Supreme Court judgments or constitutional amendments.  Each pair represents a significant development in Indian constitutional law.

1.  **Judicial Review and Kesavananda Bharati:**  While *Kesavananda Bharati* is primarily known for establishing the Basic Structure Doctrine, the case also significantly involved the power of judicial review, as the court examined the validity of constitutional amendments.

2.  **Basic Structure Doctrine and Minerva Mills:** The *Minerva Mills* case is a crucial subsequent case that further clarified and reaffirmed the Basic Structure Doctrine, strengthening the judiciary's role in safeguarding fundamental aspects of the Constitution.

3.  **Right to Privacy and Puttaswamy:** The *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* case (2017) is a landmark judgment that recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) of the Constitution.

4.  **Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and S.P. Gupta:** The *S.P. Gupta v. Union of India* case (1982) is considered a significant case in the development of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in India.  It broadened access to justice, allowing individuals to file cases in the public interest.

5.  **Article 368 and the First Amendment Act:** The First Amendment Act, 1951, was one of the earliest amendments to the Constitution and involved amendments under Article 368, demonstrating the practical application of the amending power.


The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  This question requires a deep understanding of constitutional law and its evolution through judicial interpretations and legislative actions.  It emphasizes both factual knowledge and analytical skills.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Writ                                  Purpose/Grounds for Issuance
1.  Habeas Corpus                              :   To challenge unlawful detention
2.  Mandamus                                  :   To compel a public authority to perform a mandatory duty
3.  Prohibition                                :   To prevent a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction
4.  Certiorari                                 :   To quash an order passed by a subordinate court or tribunal
5.  Quo Warranto                               :   To challenge the right of a person to hold a public office


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe the purpose and grounds for issuance of the five main types of writs available under Indian law. These writs are fundamental tools for judicial review and protection of fundamental rights.

1.  **Habeas Corpus:** This writ literally means "to have the body." It's used to challenge the unlawful detention of a person. The court can order the release of the individual if the detention is found to be illegal or without proper legal basis.

2.  **Mandamus:** This writ means "we command."  It's issued to compel a public authority to perform a mandatory duty it has failed to carry out.  It is a powerful tool to ensure accountability of public officials and the proper functioning of government.

3.  **Prohibition:** This writ is issued to prevent a lower court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction. It acts as a check on the powers of lower courts, preventing them from acting beyond their legal authority.

4.  **Certiorari:** This writ means "to be certified."  It is used to quash an order passed by a subordinate court or tribunal if it is found to be illegal, arbitrary, or beyond jurisdiction.  It ensures that lower courts act within their legal boundaries.

5.  **Quo Warranto:** This writ means "by what authority?" It is used to challenge a person's right to hold a public office if they have acquired the office illegally or improperly.  It is a crucial tool for maintaining integrity in public appointments.


The other options incorrectly omit one or more of these correctly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the different writs and their legal applications, vital for understanding the Indian judicial system's power to ensure accountability and the rule of law.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Golaknath case and related aspects of the Supreme Court's role:


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Landmark Judgement                 Subsequent Constitutional Amendment
    1. Golaknath case (1967)            :   30th Amendment Act
    2. Shankari Prasad case              :   17th Amendment Act
    3. Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) :   24th Amendment Act
    4. Minerva Mills case (1980)       :   42nd Amendment Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 2 accurately reflects a direct legislative response to a Supreme Court judgment.  The Shankari Prasad case (1951) and Sajjan Singh case (1965), both held that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution was unlimited.  The 17th Amendment Act (1964) was enacted in response to these judgments, seeking to explicitly grant Parliament the power to amend fundamental rights.

Option (a) is incorrect as the Golaknath case directly led to the 24th and 25th Amendment Acts. The 30th Amendment Act dealt with the removal of the monetary limit on appeals to the Supreme Court in civil cases. Option (b) is also incorrect because while the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) did lead to further amendments, the 24th Amendment Act was a direct response to the Golaknath case, not Kesavananda Bharati.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Minerva Mills case, which upheld the basic structure doctrine, didn't directly result in the 42nd Amendment Act; though the 42nd Amendment was subsequently challenged and partially overturned based on the basic structure doctrine.  The 42nd Amendment made significant changes to the Constitution, including those relating to fundamental rights. However, it wasn't a direct legislative response in the same way the 17th Amendment was to the Shankari Prasad and Sajjan Singh cases.


**2. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Power/Jurisdiction                  Source/Basis
    1. Advisory Jurisdiction             :    Article 143
    2. Original Jurisdiction in inter-state disputes : Article 131
    3. Power to review its own judgments :   Constitutional Convention
    4. Power to issue writs              :   Article 32


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a).  The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction is explicitly granted under Article 143 of the Constitution.  Article 131 grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and one or more States, or between States. Article 32 empowers the Supreme Court to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights.

Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of Article 32. Option (c) is incorrect because the power of the Supreme Court to review its own judgments is not based on a specific constitutional article but is an inherent power to ensure consistency and correct errors. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason as option (c).  The self-review power is an implied power based on judicial precedent and the need for a consistent and just legal system.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Case                             Ruling related to Constitutional Amendments
    1. Golaknath case (1967)             :   Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is unlimited
    2. Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)   :   Parliament cannot amend the "basic structure" of the Constitution
    3. Minerva Mills case (1980)         :    Parliament can amend fundamental rights without affecting the basic structure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Golaknath case (1967) ruled that Parliament could not amend fundamental rights.  The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) established the "basic structure" doctrine, limiting Parliament's amending power. The Minerva Mills case (1980) upheld the basic structure doctrine and clarified that while Parliament could amend fundamental rights, it couldn't alter the basic structure of the Constitution.

Option (a) is incorrect because the Golaknath case's ruling was the opposite of the statement provided. Option (b) is incorrect because it excludes the correct interpretation of the Minerva Mills case. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect interpretation of the Golaknath case.


**4. With reference to the Golaknath case (1967), consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment Act                          Impact on Golaknath ruling
    1. 24th Amendment Act (1971)         :   Overturned the Golaknath ruling partially
    2. 25th Amendment Act (1971)         :   Overturned the Golaknath ruling partially
    3. 42nd Amendment Act (1976)         :   Further strengthened the limitations on amending power


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 24th and 25th Amendment Acts were direct responses to the Golaknath case, which had restricted Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, particularly fundamental rights.  These amendments aimed to overturn the Golaknath ruling by explicitly granting Parliament the power to amend fundamental rights. The 42nd Amendment Act made further changes to the Constitution, but its impact on the Golaknath ruling was indirect; it didn't directly address or overturn the judgment, rather it sought to consolidate the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. The basic structure doctrine, established later, further limited the amending power.

Option (b) is incomplete; it does not include the 25th Amendment Act, which also had a similar effect to the 24th. Option (c) incorrectly links the 42nd Amendment as directly impacting the Golaknath judgment.  Option (d) is incorrect because the 42nd Amendment didn't directly overturn the Golaknath ruling.  It was the 24th and 25th amendments that directly addressed the Golaknath ruling.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Supreme Court Judgement        Key Legal Doctrine Applied/Established
    1. Golaknath Case (1967)         :    Basic Structure Doctrine
    2. Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973) :   Doctrine of Prospective Overruling
    3. Minerva Mills Case (1980)     :    Doctrine of Severability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) is famously associated with the establishment of the "basic structure" doctrine.  While other doctrines might have been considered during the judgement, the central outcome is the establishment of the basic structure doctrine.  The Golaknath case did not establish the basic structure doctrine; it preceded it. The Minerva Mills case primarily dealt with the basic structure doctrine and its implications, not the doctrine of severability, though the Court might have used it in some aspect of its judgement.

Option (a) is incorrect because the basic structure doctrine wasn't established in the Golaknath case. Option (c) is incorrect because the Minerva Mills case is primarily known for its application of the basic structure doctrine. Option (d) is incorrect as the Minerva Mills case is not solely associated with the doctrine of severability; its primary focus was the basic structure doctrine.  The doctrine of prospective overruling is often discussed in relation to the Kesavananda Bharati case.  This is because the court departed from its previous Golaknath ruling, but only for future cases.


These questions aim to test the candidate's knowledge of landmark Supreme Court cases, their impact on constitutional law, and the application of various legal doctrines.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of each case and its implications.

3. Governor of a State                          :   Article 153
4. Attorney General of India                    :   Article 76
5. Election Commissioner of India                :   Article 324


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall related to the constitutional positions in India and the articles that define them.  All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 52 of the Indian Constitution deals with the office of the President, Article 63 with the Vice-President, Article 153 with the Governor, and Article 76 with the Attorney General. Although Article 324 doesn't directly *appoint* the Election Commissioner, it establishes the Election Commission and outlines its functions, making the connection valid within the context of the question. The other options are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.  Option (a) omits the Attorney General and the Election Commissioner. Option (b) omits the Election Commissioner. Option (d) incorrectly omits  the Governor and the Vice-President and incorrectly pairs the President with Article 324.  A comprehensive understanding of the Indian Constitution's structure and key articles is necessary to answer this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

  Person                                        Role/Position Held
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                             :   Governor-General of India
2. Rajendra Prasad                               :   President of India
3. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel                      :   Prime Minister of India
4. C. Rajagopalachari                           :   Governor-General of India
5.  B.R. Ambedkar                               :  President of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses factual recall of historical figures and their positions in the early years of independent India.  Only Rajendra Prasad served as President of India and C. Rajagopalachari served as the last Governor-General of India. Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister, not Governor-General. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did not hold the position of Prime Minister.  B.R. Ambedkar was instrumental in drafting the Constitution but did not serve as President.  Option (a) is incorrect as Nehru was not Governor-General. Option (c) is incorrect because it only includes Rajendra Prasad, omitting C. Rajagopalachari. Option (d) is incorrect as it only includes C. Rajagopalachari, omitting Rajendra Prasad. Understanding the roles and timelines of significant figures in India's early post-independence period is key to getting this question right.


**3. With reference to the Indian President's powers, consider the following pairs:**

   Power                                         Nature of Power
1. Appointing the Prime Minister                 :   Discretionary Power
2. Promulgating Ordinances                       :   Executive Power
3. Granting Pardons                              :   Judicial Power
4. Addressing Joint Sittings of Parliament      :   Legislative Power
5. Dissolving the Lok Sabha                     :   Constitutional Power


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The question tests the understanding of the Indian President's powers and their classification.  While the President's power to appoint the Prime Minister is largely based on convention and the advice of the Lok Sabha, it's not entirely devoid of discretion, especially in hung parliament scenarios, making the classification of discretionary power a somewhat acceptable, albeit nuanced, description.  Promulgating ordinances is a clear executive function.  Granting pardons is a judicial power, reflecting the President's role in clemency. Addressing joint sittings of Parliament is a legislative power.  Dissolving the Lok Sabha is a power explicitly granted by the Constitution. Option (a) is incorrect as it misclassifies the President's power to appoint the Prime Minister and to dissolve the Lok Sabha. Option (b) incorrectly classifies the power of addressing joint sittings of Parliament. Option (d) incorrectly classifies the power of promulgating ordinances, addressing joint sittings of Parliament, and dissolving the Lok Sabha.  A thorough knowledge of the President's role in the Indian political system is crucial to accurately match the powers with their nature.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Legal Instrument/Document                  Power/Action Associated
1. Ordinance                                  :   Power of the President
2. Money Bill                                 :   Recommendation from Lok Sabha
3. Impeachment Resolution                     :   Removal of the President
4. Presidential Reference                     :   Consultation with Supreme Court
5. Writ of Certiorari                         :   Power of the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question tests the knowledge of different legal instruments and their associated powers or actions within the Indian constitutional framework.  All pairs are correctly matched. Ordinances are promulgated by the President. Money Bills require a recommendation from the Lok Sabha before being presented to the President. An Impeachment Resolution is the mechanism for removing the President.  A Presidential Reference involves the President seeking the Supreme Court's opinion on a legal matter.  The writ of Certiorari is a power held by the Supreme Court. The other options are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs. Option (a) omits the writ of certiorari.  Option (c) incorrectly omits the Ordinance and Presidential Reference. Option (d) omits the Impeachment Resolution, Money Bill, Presidential Reference and incorrectly pairs the ordinance with the Supreme Court.  A solid understanding of the Indian legal system and its processes is required to answer this correctly.


**5. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Jurisdiction/Power                          Nature of Jurisdiction/Power
1. Original Jurisdiction                       :   Exclusive in certain cases
2. Appellate Jurisdiction                      :   Covers civil and criminal matters
3. Advisory Jurisdiction                       :   Sought by the President
4. Judicial Review                             :   Basic feature of the Constitution
5. Writ Jurisdiction                           :   Extended to Tribunals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question focuses on the various jurisdictions and powers of the Supreme Court of India and their nature.  All pairs are correctly matched. The Supreme Court possesses original jurisdiction, which is exclusive in certain specified cases. Its appellate jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal matters.  The President can seek its advisory opinion (Advisory Jurisdiction). Judicial review is a fundamental aspect of the Indian Constitution, upheld by the Supreme Court itself.  The Supreme Court's writ jurisdiction has been extended to cover Administrative Tribunals. The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly omit one or more correctly matched pairs. Option (a) omits judicial review and writ jurisdiction. Option (c) omits original and appellate jurisdiction and judicial review. Option (d) omits original, appellate, advisory jurisdiction and judicial review. A comprehensive understanding of the Supreme Court's role and its powers within the Indian legal system is essential for a correct answer.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                       Scheduled Area Status
1. Bihar                       :   Has extensive Scheduled Areas
2. Telangana                 :   Lacks Scheduled Areas entirely
3. Jharkhand                  :   Designated as a Scheduled Area
4. Andhra Pradesh            :   Partially comprises Scheduled Areas
5. Gujarat                     :   Contains significant Scheduled Areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat are states that contain Scheduled Areas, reflecting the presence of tribal populations and the need for special administrative provisions under the Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.  Bihar does not have Scheduled Areas. Telangana also does not have Scheduled Areas. The correct pairings highlight the presence or absence of Scheduled Areas within specific Indian states, reflecting the geographical distribution of these constitutionally designated regions. Option (a) is incorrect as Bihar is not a state with Scheduled Areas. Option (c) is incorrect as both Bihar and Telangana do not have Scheduled Areas. Option (d) is incorrect as it omits the correct matching pairs of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.  Understanding the geographical distribution of Scheduled Areas is crucial for comprehending the implementation of policies aimed at the welfare and development of Scheduled Tribes in India.  The question tests factual knowledge about the states and their designation under the Fifth Schedule.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body          Administrative Function in Scheduled Areas
1. Gram Sabha                :   Final say on land acquisition for projects
2. District Council           :   Exclusive power to levy all local taxes
3. State Government          :   No direct administrative role whatsoever
4. Union Government           :   Oversees the overall administration
5. Tribes Advisory Council  :   Advises on matters concerning Scheduled Tribes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Gram Sabha, as per the PESA Act, plays a crucial role in the process of land acquisition for development projects in Scheduled Areas, providing a crucial layer of consultation and consent. The Union Government maintains an oversight role in the overall administration of Scheduled Areas, ensuring adherence to constitutional provisions and providing guidance. The Tribes Advisory Council, established at the state level, is tasked with advising on matters related to the welfare and advancement of Scheduled Tribes residing in these areas.  Option (a) is partially correct, but it omits the crucial role of the Tribes Advisory Council. Option (b) is incorrect; State Governments do have a role in administration, and District Councils do not have exclusive taxing powers. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in options 2 and 3. This question assesses the conceptual understanding of the administrative structure within Scheduled Areas and the roles and responsibilities of various government bodies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation            Key Provision Regarding Scheduled Areas
1. PESA Act                   :   Mandates prior consultation with Gram Sabhas for mining leases
2. Fifth Schedule             :   Empowers the President to declare Scheduled Areas
3. 73rd Amendment Act        :   Extends Panchayati Raj provisions to Scheduled Areas (with modifications)
4. Sixth Schedule             :   Governs administration of tribal areas in Northeast India (excluding Assam)
5. Indian Constitution         :   Does not address Scheduled Areas directly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Explanation:**

The PESA Act explicitly mandates prior consultation with Gram Sabhas for the grant of mining leases and other matters related to the exploitation of minor minerals in Scheduled Areas. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution gives the President the power to declare and modify Scheduled Areas. The 73rd Amendment Act, while not directly applicable to Scheduled Areas initially, has been extended through the PESA Act, making Panchayati Raj provisions applicable in these areas with specific modifications.  Option (b) is incorrect because the Indian Constitution does address Scheduled Areas (through the Fifth Schedule). Option (c) is partially correct, but it omits the correct matching pair of the 73rd Amendment Act and its modified application. Option (d) is incorrect due to the incorrect matching pair of the Sixth Schedule and its exclusion of Assam.  This question tests the candidates' knowledge of the legal framework governing Scheduled Areas, highlighting the interlinkages between different acts and constitutional provisions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Instrument          Provision Related to Tribal Land
1. Fifth Schedule            :   Allows for regulations restricting land transfer among Scheduled Tribes
2. PESA Act                  :   Mandates Gram Sabha consultation on land acquisition
3. Sixth Schedule            :   Grants autonomous districts control over land management in Northeast India
4. FRA (Forest Rights Act)  :   Deals primarily with forest rights, not all tribal lands
5. Land Acquisition Act      :   Governs all land acquisitions, irrespective of tribal status


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Fifth Schedule empowers the Governor to make regulations that can restrict or prohibit the transfer of land by or among Scheduled Tribes within Scheduled Areas.  The PESA Act mandates consultation with Gram Sabhas before land acquisition in Scheduled Areas for development projects. The Sixth Schedule provides for autonomous districts in certain Northeastern states to have significant control over land management within their territories. The FRA primarily deals with forest rights, not all land rights of tribal people.  The Land Acquisition Act applies to all land acquisitions and doesn't specifically address tribal land rights.  Option (b) is incorrect because the Land Acquisition Act does not specifically address tribal land rights. Option (c) is incorrect as the FRA doesn't cover all tribal lands and the PESA Act mandates consultation, not complete control. Option (d) is partially correct but omits the Fifth Schedule's provisions. The question tests the understanding of various legal instruments and their specific provisions concerning tribal land rights, requiring an analytical understanding of the interplay between these legal frameworks.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry                      Area of Responsibility
1. Ministry of Tribal Affairs   :   Implementation of the PESA Act
2. Ministry of Rural Development:   Implementation of the FRA (Forest Rights Act)
3. Ministry of Panchayati Raj  :   Oversight of all Panchayati Raj Institutions
4. Ministry of Home Affairs    :   Administration of Union Territories
5. Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change: Management of all forest resources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for the implementation of the PESA Act, which governs Panchayats in Scheduled Areas. The Ministry of Rural Development is involved in the implementation of the FRA, aiming to recognize forest rights of tribal communities and other traditional forest dwellers. The Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for the administration of Union Territories. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has oversight over Panchayati Raj institutions but not exclusively all of them. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change does not manage *all* forest resources; several other ministries have related responsibilities. Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (b) is incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because of the over-generalizations about the Ministries of Panchayati Raj and Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The question tests the understanding of the distribution of responsibilities among different ministries of the Union Government, demanding factual recall and analytical skills.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                     Key Provision/Entity
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act                 :   Establishment of Panchayats at village, intermediate, and district levels
2. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :   Grant of habitat rights to tribal communities
3. PESA Act, 1996                                    :   Gram Sabha's role in land acquisition decisions in Scheduled Areas
4.  Article 243A of the Constitution                  :   Definition and powers of Gram Sabha
5. Eleventh Schedule to the Constitution              :  List of 29 functional items for Panchayats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act is the cornerstone of the Panchayati Raj system in India, establishing a three-tier structure of Panchayats. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, explicitly grants forest rights, including habitat rights, to tribal communities. The PESA Act, 1996, extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution to Scheduled Areas, giving Gram Sabhas a crucial voice in developmental projects, including land acquisition. Article 243A defines the Gram Sabha and outlines its powers and functions within the Panchayati Raj system. Finally, the Eleventh Schedule lists the 29 functional items that Panchayats are responsible for, encompassing a wide range of developmental activities.  All the pairs are correctly matched, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the legal and institutional framework governing local governance in India, particularly concerning tribal rights and the Panchayati Raj system.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Instrument/Act                                    Subject Matter
1.  Article 243G of the Constitution                    :   Composition of Panchayats
2.  PESA Act, 1996                                      :   Regulation of intoxicants in Scheduled Areas
3. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :   Ownership of minor forest produce
4.  Eleventh Schedule to the Constitution                :   Financial powers of Panchayats
5.  73rd Constitutional Amendment Act                  :   Reservation of seats for women in Panchayats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 243G deals with the composition of Panchayats, specifying the number of members and their election. The PESA Act empowers Gram Sabhas and Panchayats in Scheduled Areas to regulate or prohibit intoxicants. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, grants ownership rights over minor forest produce to tribal communities. The Eleventh Schedule outlines the functions of Panchayats but doesn't directly address their financial powers; that's covered by other constitutional provisions and state legislation. The 73rd Amendment mandates reservation of seats for women in Panchayats. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, while (c) correctly identifies the matched pairs.  Understanding the nuances of these different legal instruments and their specific provisions is crucial for analyzing the framework of local governance in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Body                                    Primary Function Related to Panchayats
1. State Finance Commission                             :   Recommending principles for determining Panchayat taxes and duties
2. Gram Sabha                                         :   Approving development plans before implementation by village Panchayats
3. Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA)                     :   Implementing the PESA Act
4. State Election Commission                            :   Conducting elections to Panchayats
5. Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)       :   Auditing Panchayat accounts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The State Finance Commission plays a vital role in the financial health of Panchayats by recommending tax principles.  Gram Sabhas are crucial for participatory democracy at the village level, approving plans before implementation.  The MoTA is responsible for implementing the PESA Act, which governs Panchayats in Scheduled Areas.  The State Election Commission conducts Panchayat elections, ensuring democratic representation. The CAG audits the accounts of Panchayats, including those of the Gram Panchayats to maintain financial accountability.  All five pairs accurately reflect the key functions of these bodies in relation to Panchayats, showcasing an understanding of the checks and balances in the system.  Option (c) is the only one that correctly identifies all the accurate pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Provision/Act                                 Impact on Panchayats
1. Article 243-O of the Constitution                 :   Protection of Panchayats from dissolution
2. Part IX of the Constitution                        :   Establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution             :   Functional responsibilities of Panchayats
4. PESA Act, 1996                                    :   Extension of Panchayati Raj to Scheduled Areas
5. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act                  :   Constitutional status for Panchayats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 243-O provides safeguards against the arbitrary dissolution of Panchayats. Part IX of the Constitution establishes the Panchayati Raj system, providing a constitutional basis.  The Eleventh Schedule details the functions of Panchayats, outlining their responsibilities. The PESA Act extends the Panchayati Raj system to Scheduled Areas, adapting it to the specific needs of tribal communities.  The 73rd Amendment is the key legislation that gave constitutional status to Panchayats.  All five pairs reflect a comprehensive understanding of the legal and constitutional framework governing Panchayats in India. Option (c) correctly encompasses all the accurate pairings, demonstrating a strong grasp of the subject matter.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Instrument/Act                                  Specific Power/Responsibility Granted to Gram Sabha
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act                     :   Power to manage community resources
2. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :  Recommendation for mining leases in Scheduled Areas
3. PESA Act, 1996                                      :   Certification of fund utilization by village Panchayats
4. Article 243A of the Constitution                   :   Power to prevent land alienation in Scheduled Areas
5.  Eleventh Schedule                                   :  Right to approve village development plans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act, while not explicitly mentioning "community resource management", lays the groundwork for Gram Sabhas to participate in local governance, which includes managing such resources. The FRA grants the Gram Sabha significant powers including recommending mining leases.  PESA further enhances the Gram Sabha's role by mandating its certification of fund utilization. Article 243A empowers the Gram Sabha to prevent land alienation.  The Eleventh Schedule, by outlining Panchayati Raj functions, implicitly supports the Gram Sabha's role in approving plans. Option (c) correctly matches all the pairs, showing a deep understanding of the powers and roles of Gram Sabhas within the broader framework of Panchayati Raj.  The other options are incomplete because they miss some of the correctly matched pairs.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided data, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring accurate factual recall and analysis.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                  Number of Legislative Assembly Seats
1. Arunachal Pradesh       :    70
2. Manipur                 :    65
3. Nagaland                :    60
4. Goa                     :    40
5. Sikkim                  :    32

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Nagaland correctly has 60 seats in its Legislative Assembly. Sikkim also correctly has 32 seats.  Option (a) is incorrect as Arunachal Pradesh has 60 seats, not 70. Option (b) is incorrect because while Nagaland is correctly matched, other pairs are not. Option (d) is incorrect; Manipur has 60 seats, not 65, and Goa has 40.  The question tests factual recall of the number of seats in state legislative assemblies, a detail often overlooked in general knowledge preparation but crucial for certain UPSC questions.  The distractors are designed to be close enough to the actual numbers to make the question challenging for candidates who may have a vague recollection.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   State             Official Language
1. Nagaland           :    Hindi
2. Assam              :    Bengali
3. Manipur            :    Meiteilon
4. Arunachal Pradesh :    English
5. Tripura            :    Bengali

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only Arunachal Pradesh correctly has English as its official language. The other options present plausible but incorrect pairings. Nagaland's official language is English, not Hindi (1). Assam's official language is Assamese, not Bengali (2). While Meiteilon is a major language in Manipur, it is not the sole official language; English is also official (3).  Tripura's official language is Kokborok, not Bengali (5). This question tests the understanding of official languages in Indian states, a topic that often requires detailed knowledge beyond the commonly known languages. The distractors use closely related or regionally prominent languages to increase the difficulty.


**3. With reference to special provisions in the Indian Constitution for certain states, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article     State
1. Article 371A              :    Karnataka
2. Article 371B              :    Nagaland
3. Article 371C              :    Manipur
4. Article 371D              :    Maharashtra
5. Article 371E              :    Andhra Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Articles 371B, 371C, and 371E correctly correspond to Nagaland, Manipur, and Andhra Pradesh respectively.  The incorrect pairings test a candidate's understanding of the specific articles and the states they apply to.  Article 371A applies to Nagaland, not Karnataka (1). Article 371D applies to Andhra Pradesh, not Maharashtra (4).  This question tests detailed knowledge of the specific constitutional articles dealing with special provisions for states, a higher-order cognitive skill requiring in-depth understanding of Indian constitutional law.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   State           Major River
1. Andhra Pradesh   :    Brahmaputra
2. Assam            :    Godavari
3. Telangana        :    Krishna
4. Odisha           :    Mahanadi
5. Karnataka         :    Cauvery

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Telangana (Krishna), Odisha (Mahanadi), and Karnataka (Cauvery) are correctly paired with their major rivers. The incorrect pairings use rivers from other states as distractors. The Brahmaputra flows through Assam, but is not its only major river (1).  The Godavari does not primarily flow through Assam; it's associated with other states (2). This question tests the ability to link states with their primary river systems, a facet of geographical knowledge frequently tested in the UPSC exam. The difficulty lies in the plausible distractors, requiring precise geographical awareness.


**5. With reference to the PESA Act, 1996, consider the following pairs:**

   State            PESA Applicability
1. Rajasthan        :     Applicable
2. Telangana        :     Not Applicable
3. Odisha           :     Applicable
4. Meghalaya        :     Not Applicable
5. Tamil Nadu       :     Applicable


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PESA Act is not applicable in Telangana and Meghalaya.  Rajasthan, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu are states where the PESA Act is applicable. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the geographical scope of the PESA Act's applicability, which goes beyond merely knowing the Act's purpose.  Candidates need to know which states it specifically excludes.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

State                 Number of Rajya Sabha Seats
1. Uttar Pradesh       :    31
2. Andhra Pradesh      :    11
3. Telangana          :    7
4. Maharashtra         :    19
5. Karnataka           :    12


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Uttar Pradesh (31) and Andhra Pradesh (11) are correctly paired with their respective Rajya Sabha seat counts.  The other options contain incorrect data. Telangana has 7 seats, not 12 (3). Maharashtra has 19 seats, but the pairing is incorrect due to other incorrect pairings (4). Karnataka has 12 seats, but other pairings are incorrect (5).  This question tests the detailed knowledge of Rajya Sabha seat allocation across different states.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                    Highest Peak
1. Nagaland                 :    Mt. Everest
2. Manipur                  :    Mt. Kangto
3. Arunachal Pradesh         :    Mt. Saramati
4. Meghalaya                :    Mt. K2
5. Sikkim                   :    Kangchenjunga


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairs for Arunachal Pradesh (Mt. Kangto) and Sikkim (Kangchenjunga) are correctly matched.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates by using well-known mountains from other parts of the Himalayas. Nagaland's highest peak is Saramati, not Mt. Everest (1). Manipur's highest peak is Mt. Shirui, not Mt. Kangto (2). Meghalaya's highest peak is not Mt. K2 (4). This question tests geographical knowledge, specifically the ability to recall the highest peaks within particular states.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   State          Major Forest Type
1. Assam           :    Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests
2. Odisha          :    Subtropical Dry Evergreen Forests
3. Karnataka       :    Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests
4. Rajasthan       :    Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests
5. Gujarat         :    Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Karnataka is predominantly known for Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests, and Rajasthan for Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests.  The other options contain incorrect or partially correct information about the major forest types found in the states. Assam has a mix of forest types, but Tropical Dry Deciduous is not its primary type (1).  Odisha contains Tropical Dry Deciduous and other types, not Subtropical Dry Evergreen (2). Gujarat also has a variety of forests, but Tropical Moist Deciduous is not its defining type (5). This question tests knowledge of the predominant forest types of Indian states, which often requires more in-depth knowledge than simply knowing the presence of different forest types.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   State             Major Mineral Resource
1. Jharkhand        :    Bauxite
2. Odisha           :    Iron Ore
3. Chhattisgarh     :    Coal
4. Rajasthan        :    Manganese
5. Karnataka         :    Copper


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Odisha (Iron Ore), Chhattisgarh (Coal), and Karnataka (Copper) are correctly paired with their major mineral resources.  While Jharkhand and Rajasthan have these minerals, they are not the primary resources for those states.  Jharkhand is known more for coal than bauxite (1). Rajasthan is known for its Zinc and other minerals; manganese is not its primary resource (4). This question tests knowledge of major mineral resources found in different Indian states, requiring more than just general awareness.  The distractors provide minerals found in the states, but not those that define the state's mining economy.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   State               Major Agricultural Product
1. Uttar Pradesh       :    Tea
2. Punjab              :    Cotton
3. Haryana             :    Wheat
4. Gujarat             :    Rice
5. Tamil Nadu          :    Jowar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Haryana is a major producer of wheat, and Tamil Nadu of Jowar. While other states produce these crops, they are not their primary agricultural products. Uttar Pradesh is known for its sugarcane and rice, not tea (1). Punjab is known for wheat and rice, not cotton (2). Gujarat is a major producer of cotton, not rice (4). This question tests knowledge of major agricultural products of Indian states, a key area in UPSC preparation that often requires detailed knowledge beyond the commonly known crops. The inclusion of several plausible distractors necessitates a strong understanding of agricultural patterns across different states.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act     Focus Area
1. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992        :   Urban Local Governments
2. 74th Amendment Act, 1992        :   Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 64th Amendment Act (lapsed)   :   Municipal Corporation Elections
4.  74th Amendment Act, 1992        :   Metropolitan Planning Committees


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 is primarily concerned with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), establishing a three-tier system of local governance in rural areas.  The 74th Amendment Act of 1992 focuses on Municipalities, providing a framework for urban local governance.  The 64th Amendment Bill, while aiming to strengthen Panchayati Raj, never became law. Option 4 is correct because the 74th Amendment Act introduced Metropolitan Planning Committees as a crucial component of urban planning and development.  Options 1 and 3 are incorrect because they misrepresent the focus of the respective amendments.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                      Function related to Panchayats
1. State Legislature                     :   Conducts Panchayat Elections
2. State Election Commission           :   Prepares Panchayat Electoral Rolls
3.  Governor                             :   Dissolves Panchayats
4. District Planning Committee         :   Reviews Panchayat Finances


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

State Election Commissions are responsible for conducting elections to Panchayats and preparing electoral rolls. Governors, as the constitutional head of a state, have the power to dissolve Panchayats under certain circumstances, usually when they fail to function effectively.  State legislatures create the legal framework for Panchayats but don't directly conduct elections or prepare rolls. District Planning Committees coordinate planning but don't review Panchayat finances; that is the role of the State Finance Commission.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                     Recommendation
1. Ashok Mehta Committee                    :   Three-tier Panchayati Raj System
2. Balwant Rai Mehta Committee               :   Two-tier Panchayati Raj System
3. L.M. Singhvi Committee                  :   Constitutional recognition of Panchayats
4. G.V.K. Rao Committee                     :   Rationalization of Panchayat Statistics


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee (1957) recommended a three-tier Panchayati Raj system, not a two-tier system as stated in option 2. The Ashok Mehta Committee (1978) focused on strengthening PRIs, but its primary recommendation wasn’t a three-tier system, but rather a more complex system of decentralization.  The L.M. Singhvi Committee (1986) strongly advocated for constitutional recognition and protection of Panchayati Raj institutions, which was a key element in the 73rd Amendment. The G.V.K. Rao Committee did focus on Panchayat statistics, suggesting rationalization.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Instrument                    Provision Related to Panchayats
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act :   Grants financial powers to Panchayats
2. Eleventh Schedule                  :   Assigns functions to Municipalities
3. Part IX of the Constitution          :   Defines the composition of Gram Sabhas
4. PESA Act, 1996                       :   Applies only to urban areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act grants constitutional status to Panchayats and empowers them with specific functions and financial powers. Part IX of the Constitution specifically deals with Panchayats, outlining their structure and functions, including the role of Gram Sabhas.  The Eleventh Schedule lists the 29 functional items for Panchayats, not Municipalities.  The PESA Act extends the provisions of Part IX to Scheduled Areas (primarily tribal areas), not urban areas. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Gram Sabha Characteristic          Description
1.  Legal Status                       :   Defined by the 74th Amendment Act
2.  Composition                        :   All registered voters in a village
3.  Functions                          :   Determined by the State Legislature
4.  Relationship with Panchayats     :   Acts as a subordinate body


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gram Sabhas are defined and given constitutional status by the 73rd Amendment Act, not the 74th.  They are composed of registered voters in a village. Their functions are determined by State Legislatures within the framework of the 73rd Amendment. Gram Sabhas are not subordinate to Panchayats; rather, they play a crucial role in the Panchayati Raj system.  They act as a vital check and balance, ensuring that Panchayats function accountably and in the best interest of the community.  Therefore only options 2 and 3 are correct.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                     Tax Levied
1. Municipal Corporations              :   Sales Tax
2. Gram Panchayats                   :   Property Tax
3. Nagar Panchayats                   :   Professional Tax
4. Zila Panchayats                    :   Toll Tax

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Municipal corporations primarily levy property tax, not sales tax.  Sales tax is a state-level tax, often collected at the point of sale by businesses. Gram Panchayats, at the village level, have limited taxing powers but can levy certain local taxes, including property tax in some cases. Nagar Panchayats, governing smaller urban areas, can levy various local taxes, including professional tax (on professions and businesses). Zila Panchayats, at the district level, typically do not have the authority to levy toll taxes; toll taxes are usually levied by state or national highway authorities.  Therefore, only the pairs related to Gram Panchayats and Nagar Panchayats correctly reflect the type of tax they typically levy.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Administrative Unit                 Formation Method
1. Gram Panchayat                    :   Nomination by the District Collector
2. Municipal Corporation             :   Direct Elections
3. Nagar Panchayat                    :   Appointment by the State Government
4. Zila Panchayat                     :   Indirect Elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gram Panchayats are formed through direct elections, not nomination. Municipal corporations are also established through direct elections. Nagar Panchayats are not appointed by the state government; they are also established through elections. Zila Panchayats often involve indirect elections, where members are elected at lower levels and then elect representatives to the Zila Panchayat.  Therefore, only the pairs related to Municipal Corporations and Zila Panchayats accurately describe their formation method.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Institution                Governing Body
1. Gram Sabha                         :   Sarpanch
2. Gram Panchayat                     :   Gram Sabha
3. Panchayat Samiti                   :   Block Development Officer
4. Zila Parishad                      :   District Collector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A Gram Sabha is a village assembly; the Sarpanch is the elected head of the Gram Panchayat, not the Gram Sabha. The Gram Panchayat is the governing body of the village, and the Gram Sabha is its foundation,  not the other way around.  Panchayat Samitis are often headed by a Block Development Officer (BDO) – an administrative official. Zila Parishads are typically not directly headed by the District Collector; the Collector may play a role but not necessarily as the head. Therefore, only the pairs related to Gram Panchayat and Panchayat Samiti accurately reflect their governing bodies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Instrument                     Governing Body Established
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act  :   Municipal Corporations
2. PESA Act                             :   Gram Sabhas
3. FRA                                  :   Nagar Panchayats
4. State Legislature Act                :   Zila Panchayats

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act deals primarily with Panchayati Raj institutions, not Municipal Corporations. The PESA Act (Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act) empowers Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) doesn't directly establish Nagar Panchayats; it deals with forest rights of communities.  Zila Panchayats are established through state legislature acts. Therefore, only the pairs related to PESA Act and State Legislature Act accurately reflect the governing body established.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                      Key Function
1. Gram Sabha                          :   Land Acquisition in Scheduled Areas
2. Panchayat                           :   Poverty Alleviation Program Implementation
3. Municipal Corporation               :   Property Tax Collection
4. Nagar Panchayat                     :   Urban Planning and Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Gram Sabhas play a crucial role in consultations regarding land acquisition in Scheduled Areas under various laws. Panchayats are involved in implementing poverty alleviation programs at the village level.  Municipal corporations are responsible for collecting property tax within their jurisdiction. Nagar Panchayats are responsible for urban planning and development in smaller urban areas.  All four pairs accurately reflect the key functions of the respective government bodies.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Local Governance Body               Tenure
1. Gram Panchayat                     :   5 Years
2. Municipal Council                  :   Variable, depending on state laws
3. Nagar Panchayat                     :   5 Years
4. Zila Panchayat                      :   5 Years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the general tenure for Gram Panchayats, Nagar Panchayats, and Zila Panchayats is often 5 years, it can vary based on state-specific legislation.  The tenure of municipal councils is not uniformly 5 years across all states; it is typically determined by state laws.  Therefore, only the pairs related to Gram Panchayats and Nagar Panchayats accurately reflect the typical 5-year tenure.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                    Decision-Making Process
1. Gram Sabha                        :   Direct Democracy
2. Municipal Council                  :   Representative Democracy
3. Nagar Panchayat                    :   Representative Democracy
4. Zila Panchayat                     :   Representative Democracy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gram Sabhas operate on the principle of direct democracy, where all eligible villagers participate in decision-making. Municipal councils, Nagar Panchayats, and Zila Panchayats function through a representative democracy, where elected representatives make decisions on behalf of the population.  All four pairs accurately reflect the decision-making process within these bodies.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                           Action Related to Panchayats
1. State Election Commission                 :   Appoints Panchayat election officials
2. State Legislature                          :   Defines the term "village" for Panchayat purposes
3. State Government                          :   Sets the tenure of Panchayat members
4. Governor                                  :   Supervises Panchayat elections directly
5. Election Commission of India              :   Provides guidelines for Panchayat elections

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The State Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to Panchayats, which inherently involves appointing election officials.  The State Legislature, as per the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, has the power to define key terms like "village" within the context of Panchayat formation. The State Government plays a crucial role in determining the tenure of Panchayat members through state legislation. The Election Commission of India provides overarching guidelines and frameworks for the conduct of elections, ensuring uniformity and adherence to constitutional principles across states.  Option 4 is incorrect because the Governor does not directly supervise Panchayat elections; this is the responsibility of the State Election Commission.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete because they exclude crucial elements of the Panchayat system's governance structure.  A comprehensive understanding of the Indian Panchayat system requires knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of all these entities.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Act                    Specific Provision Regarding Panchayats
1. Article 243A                              :   Establishes Gram Sabhas
2. Article 243K                              :   Deals with the State Election Commission
3. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act         :   Mandates a three-tier Panchayat system
4. Eleventh Schedule                         :   Lists functions of Panchayats
5. Article 40                                 :   Mentions village panchayats as units of self-government

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 243A explicitly defines and establishes the Gram Sabha as a crucial component of the Panchayati Raj system. Article 243K deals with the constitution and powers of the State Election Commission, the body responsible for conducting Panchayat elections. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act is the cornerstone of the modern Panchayat system, mandating a three-tier structure.  The Eleventh Schedule lists the 29 functional items that Panchayats are empowered to handle. Finally, Article 40 of the Directive Principles of State Policy serves as the foundational principle for the organization of village Panchayats, providing the constitutional basis for the 73rd Amendment Act.  All the pairs accurately reflect the relationship between the constitutional provision/act and its specific function related to Panchayats.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to capture the full scope of the constitutional framework governing Panchayats.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee on Panchayati Raj               Key Recommendation
1. Balwantray Mehta Committee                :   Advocated a three-tier Panchayat system
2. Ashok Mehta Committee                     :   Proposed a two-tier Panchayat system
3. L.M. Singhvi Committee                   :   Recommended a constitutional status for Panchayats
4. G.V.K. Rao Committee                    :   Focused on administrative aspects of rural development
5. Hanumantha Rao Committee                 :   Emphasized district-level planning bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Balwantray Mehta Committee, a landmark in Panchayat development, famously advocated for a three-tier system (village, intermediate, and district).  The Ashok Mehta Committee, in contrast, proposed a two-tier system, aiming for a more streamlined and efficient structure. The L.M. Singhvi Committee played a pivotal role in advocating for the constitutional recognition and protection of Panchayats. The G.V.K. Rao Committee contributed significantly by focusing on the administrative aspects, ensuring smoother implementation. The Hanumantha Rao Committee highlighted the importance of efficient district-level planning bodies for effective rural development.  Each pair accurately reflects the committee's primary focus and recommendations.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to account for the diverse contributions of these significant committees in shaping the Indian Panchayat system.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various committees and their recommendations concerning the evolution of Panchayati Raj in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Urban Local Government           Governing Authority/Ministry
1. Municipal Corporation                    :   State Government
2. Municipality                              :   State Government
3. Notified Area Committee                  :   State Government
4. Cantonment Board                         :   Ministry of Defence
5. Port Trust                               :   Central Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

Municipal corporations, municipalities, and notified area committees are all established and governed primarily by state governments through state legislation.  Cantonment boards, however, fall under the purview of the Ministry of Defence, given their location within military cantonments. Port trusts are typically managed at the national level by the Central Government, given their involvement in national and international trade. Each of the pairs accurately reflects the governing authority responsible for each type of urban local government in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they fail to account for the complete list of governing bodies and their respective jurisdictions.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the diverse forms of urban local governance in India and their hierarchical relationships with different levels of government.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Amendment Act/Article                     Provision Related to Urban Local Bodies
1. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act       :   Provides constitutional status to urban local bodies
2. Article 243P                             :   Deals with the constitution of Municipalities
3. Article 243Q                             :   Deals with the composition of Municipalities
4. Article 243X                             :   Relates to the State Finance Commission
5. Article 243ZA                           :   Deals with the State Election Commission for urban bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 is the foundational legislation that provides constitutional status and protection to urban local bodies in India.  Article 243P outlines the manner in which municipalities are to be constituted, while Article 243Q specifies their composition. Article 243X establishes the State Finance Commission, responsible for recommending the principles governing the distribution of financial resources to urban local bodies.  Article 243ZA establishes the State Election Commission responsible for conducting elections to urban local bodies. Each pair accurately identifies a specific constitutional provision or amendment related to the governance of urban local bodies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because they omit significant aspects of the constitutional framework governing urban local bodies. This question assesses the candidate's detailed knowledge of the constitutional provisions governing urban local bodies in India.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the difficulty is inherent in the subtle inaccuracies and close-but-not-quite correct options presented.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                     Power/Function
1. State Legislatures                  :   Appoints the Governor
2. Parliament                           :   Delimits constituencies in Union Territories
3. State Election Commission           :   Conducts elections to the State Legislative Assembly
4. Governor                            :   Appoints the State Election Commissioner
5. Election Commission of India        :   Supervises State Election Commissions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the Governor appoints the State Election Commissioner, and the Election Commission of India indeed supervises State Election Commissions.  Let's examine the incorrect options:

* **Option (a):** Incorrect. State Legislatures do *not* appoint the Governor; the President of India does.

* **Option (b):** Incorrect. While Parliament has significant power over delimitation, it does not solely delimit constituencies in Union Territories; the Election Commission also plays a role in this process.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect. The State Election Commission conducts elections to Panchayats and Municipalities, not the State Legislative Assembly.  The Election Commission of India conducts elections for the State Legislative Assembly.


The question tests factual recall and understanding of the distribution of powers within the Indian political system at both the state and national levels.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of each pair.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article              Related Body/Function
1. Article 324                             :   State Election Commission
2. Article 243K                            :   Panchayat Elections
3. Article 75                               :   Appointment of State Election Commissioner
4. Article 243ZA                           :   State Election Commission
5. Article 170                              :   Delimitation of constituencies for State Legislative Assemblies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Article 243K deals with the composition of the State Election Commission, and its powers and functions regarding Panchayat elections.  Article 243ZA provides for the State Election Commission to conduct elections to Panchayats and Municipalities.

The incorrect options include several plausible distractors:

* **Option (b):** Incorrect. Article 324 deals with the Election Commission of India, not the State Election Commission. Article 170 deals with the composition of the State Legislative Assemblies, not delimitation directly.  The delimitation process involves multiple steps and actors beyond just Article 170.

* **Option (c):** While 2 and 4 are correct as explained above, this option is incomplete.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect. As explained above, Article 324 and Article 170 are incorrectly paired.

This question assesses factual recall and the ability to connect specific constitutional articles with their corresponding functions within the Indian electoral system. The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's precise knowledge.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Official               Appointment Authority
1. Chief Election Commissioner      :   President of India
2. State Election Commissioner     :   Governor
3. Chief Electoral Officer (CEO)    :   Election Commission of India
4. District Election Officer (DEO)  :   State Election Commission
5. Returning Officer                 :   State Election Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  The Governor appoints the State Election Commissioner. The Election Commission of India appoints the Chief Electoral Officer. While the State Election Commission appoints many election officials, the District Election Officer and Returning Officer are typically appointed by the State Election Commission or its designated authorities.

The incorrect options introduce plausible yet incorrect pairings:

* **Option (a):** Incorrect. The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner, but the other pairings are correct.

* **Option (b):** Incorrect.  The CEO is appointed by the Election Commission of India, not the state-level commission.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect. The Chief Election Commissioner is appointed by the President, not the Governor.


This question tests the candidate's understanding of the hierarchical structure of election officials and their respective appointing authorities, requiring careful attention to detail and accurate recall of facts.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                      Key Provision
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment     :   Established Municipalities
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment     :   Established Panchayats
3. Delimitation Act, 2002            :   Redistribution of constituencies based on 2001 Census
4. Representation of the People Act, 1951 :  Established the Election Commission of India
5. Representation of the People Act, 1950 :  Provides for the conduct of elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is entirely correct. The Delimitation Act of 2002 is indeed concerned with the redistribution of constituencies based on the 2001 Census. The Representation of the People Act, 1950, lays the groundwork for the conduct of elections, including the allocation of seats and delimitation of constituencies.

Let's analyze why other options are incorrect:

* **Option (a):** Incorrect. The 73rd Amendment established Panchayats, while the 74th Amendment established Municipalities.

* **Option (c):**  Incomplete. While 3 is correct, it does not encompass all correct pairings.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, details the *conduct* of elections; the Election Commission was established by the Constitution itself.


This question tests factual knowledge of significant legislation related to the Indian electoral system and its evolution. The distractors leverage common misconceptions about the roles of different acts.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the Indian political system and its intricacies.  The distractors are created to test the candidate's precise knowledge and ability to differentiate between subtly different concepts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    State Legislative Body                Power/Function
1. State Legislature                     : Determines powers of Panchayats
2. State Legislature                     : Conducts Panchayat Elections
3. State Legislature                     : Appoints State Election Commissioner
4. State Election Commission           : Oversees Panchayat Elections
5. Parliament                           : Endows Panchayats with powers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The State Legislature, as the state's legislative body, holds the power to define and delineate the powers and authorities of Panchayats through state laws.  This is a crucial aspect of the Panchayati Raj system, ensuring that Panchayats operate within the framework established by the State.  The State Election Commission is constitutionally mandated to conduct elections for Panchayats, ensuring free and fair elections at the local level.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.

Option (b) is incorrect because while Parliament can legislate on matters in the Concurrent List that impact Panchayats, the primary authority to endow Panchayats with powers rests with the State Legislature.  The State Election Commission, not Parliament, conducts Panchayat elections.

Option (c) is incorrect as the State Legislature appoints the State Election Commissioner, but the Commissioner's primary function is to conduct elections, not to determine the powers of Panchayats.

Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair involving the State Election Commission and its role in overseeing Panchayat elections.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                     Action/Responsibility
1. Gram Sabha                           : Approves Panchayat Plans
2. Gram Sabha                           : Identifies Beneficiaries for Poverty Alleviation Programs
3. Panchayat                            : Requires Certification from Gram Sabha
4. State Legislature                     : Determines Reservation for Panchayat Chairperson
5. Union/State Government               : Transfers Funds to Panchayats

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

The Gram Sabha, as the village assembly, plays a vital role in the Panchayati Raj system.  Its primary functions include approving plans and projects proposed by the Panchayat and identifying beneficiaries for various government welfare schemes, particularly those targeting poverty alleviation.  The Panchayat, in turn, is required to obtain certification from the Gram Sabha regarding the utilization of funds for approved projects, ensuring transparency and accountability. The State Legislature, possessing legislative powers, determines the reservation of seats, including those for the Chairperson, in Panchayats. Finally, the Union and State governments are responsible for transferring funds to Panchayats, crucial for their functioning and implementing development programs.  All five pairs accurately reflect the relationships and responsibilities within the Panchayati Raj framework.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Governmental Entity                 Characteristic/Function
1. Panchayat                            : Manages Minor Water Bodies
2. Panchayat                            : Land Acquisition Consultation in Scheduled Areas
3. Gram Sabha                           : Embodiment of Direct Democracy
4. Zila Parishad                        : Chaired by District Collector
5. State Legislature                     : Determines Election Method for Village Panchayats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Panchayats are responsible for the management and conservation of minor water bodies within their jurisdiction, a critical aspect of rural development.  In Scheduled Areas, Panchayats are mandated to consult with the Gram Sabha before acquiring land for development projects, respecting the rights and concerns of tribal communities. The Gram Sabha, as a body of all registered voters in a village, exemplifies the principles of direct democracy at the grassroots level. The State Legislature, through its legislative powers, determines the method of conducting elections for village Panchayats.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Pair 4 is incorrect; while the District Collector may often play a significant administrative role, the Chairperson of the Zila Parishad is typically elected from among its members.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment Act      Provision Related to Panchayats
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act : Establishes Gram Sabha
2. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act : Defines Panchayats as institutions of self-government
3. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act : Mandates five-year term for Panchayats
4. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act :  Deals with Municipalities
5. PESA Act                             :  Applies customary law in Scheduled Areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act is the cornerstone of the Panchayati Raj system in India. It establishes the Gram Sabha as a crucial body at the village level, defines Panchayats as institutions of self-government, and mandates a five-year term for Panchayats. The 74th Amendment Act deals with the constitution and functioning of Municipalities. The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA Act), ensures that state legislation concerning Panchayats in Scheduled Areas aligns with customary law, traditional practices, and the social and religious customs of the tribal communities. Thus, all five pairs are correctly matched.  Each pair accurately reflects the specific provisions of these key legislative acts concerning local governance in India.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article Number                     Subject Matter
1. Article 243A                       : Defines Gram Sabha
2. Article 243B                       : Composition of Panchayats
3. Article 243G                       : Powers and Responsibilities of Panchayats
4. Article 243I                       : Constitution of State Finance Commission
5. Article 371                         : Mentions Governors' Special Responsibilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 243A of the Indian Constitution specifically defines the Gram Sabha and its role in the Panchayati Raj system. Article 243G outlines the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Panchayats at different levels. Article 243I mandates the constitution of State Finance Commissions to review the financial position of Panchayats. Article 371 addresses the special responsibilities of Governors in certain states.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect; Article 243C deals with the composition of Panchayats, not Article 243B.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific articles of the Constitution related to local governance.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Committee Name                    Focus/Recommendation
1. Ashok Mehta Committee             : Two-tier Panchayat System
2. Balwantray Mehta Committee         : Three-tier Panchayat System
3. L.M. Singhvi Committee            : Constitutional Status for Panchayats
4. G.V.K. Rao Committee              : Administrative Aspects of Rural Development
5. Hanumantha Rao Committee          : District-Level Planning


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

The Ashok Mehta Committee recommended a two-tier Panchayat system, aiming for a more streamlined and efficient structure. The Balwantray Mehta Committee, instrumental in the initial establishment of Panchayati Raj, proposed a three-tier system. The L.M. Singhvi Committee advocated for giving Panchayats constitutional status and protection. The G.V.K. Rao Committee focused on the administrative aspects of rural development, seeking improvements in the existing system. The Hanumantha Rao Committee specifically addressed the need for effective district-level planning within the Panchayati Raj framework. Each committee played a distinct role in shaping the evolution and structure of the Panchayati Raj system in India, making all five pairs correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    State                                  Specific Feature of Governance
1. Maharashtra                           :  Three-tier Panchayat system (Village, Panchayat Samiti, Zilla Parishad)
2. Madhya Pradesh                       : Three-tier Panchayat system (Village, Janpad Panchayat, Zila Parishad)
3. Gujarat                               : Three-tier Panchayat system (Village, Taluka Panchayat, District Panchayat)
4. Nagaland                              : Does not have a three-tier Panchayat system
5. Meghalaya                             : Does not have a three-tier Panchayat system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat all have three-tier Panchayat systems, although the names of the intermediate and district-level bodies may vary across states.  Nagaland and Meghalaya, however, are exceptions to the general three-tier structure due to their unique constitutional arrangements and the prevalence of customary law and traditional governance structures.  Therefore, all five pairs correctly match the state with a relevant characteristic of its Panchayati Raj system or its deviation from the standard model.  The question tests knowledge of the variations in the implementation of Panchayati Raj across different states.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    State                                  Provisions of Article 371
1. Maharashtra                           : Special Provisions related to development of backward areas.
2. Gujarat                               : Special Provisions related to administration of tribal areas.
3. Nagaland                              : Special Provisions related to law and order.
4. Karnataka                             : Does not have provisions under Article 371.
5. Madhya Pradesh                       : Special Provisions relating to the appointment of a Minister for Tribal Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 371 of the Indian Constitution allows for special provisions for certain states, particularly concerning the administration of tribal areas, development of backward regions, and maintaining law and order.  Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Nagaland are states that have special provisions under Article 371 which are related to development of backward areas, administration of tribal areas, and law and order. Karnataka is not explicitly mentioned in Article 371.  The statement relating to Madhya Pradesh is incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific provisions of Article 371 and their application to various states.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Urban Local Government       Example City
1. Municipal Corporation                : Mumbai
2. Municipal Corporation                : Delhi
3. Municipal Council                    :  A smaller city
4. Nagar Panchayat                      : A smaller urban area
5. Cantonment Board                     : A military cantonment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Mumbai and Delhi are examples of cities governed by Municipal Corporations, a type of urban local government designed for larger cities.  Nagar Panchayats are established for smaller urban areas, and Cantonment Boards administer municipal functions in military cantonments.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pair 3 is too general; while many smaller cities are governed by Municipal Councils, this is not universally true.  The question tests knowledge of the different types of urban local governments and their geographical context.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ministry                                  Subject Matter (Central Level)
1. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs : Deals with Urban Local Governments (excluding Cantonment Boards)
2. Ministry of Defence                     : Deals with Cantonment Boards
3. Ministry of Home Affairs                 : Deals with Urban Local Governments in Union Territories
4. Ministry of Panchayati Raj              : Deals with Panchayats at all levels
5. Ministry of Rural Development           : Oversees Rural Development Programs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

At the central level, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is primarily responsible for urban local government matters except those concerning Cantonment Boards, which fall under the Ministry of Defence. The Ministry of Home Affairs deals with urban local governments in Union Territories.  The Ministry of Panchayati Raj is specifically responsible for Panchayats. The Ministry of Rural Development oversees various rural development programs.  All five pairs accurately reflect the central government ministries and their respective roles in urban and rural local governance in India.  This question tests the candidate's familiarity with the organizational structure of the Indian central government and its engagement with local governance.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                      Key Provision/Impact
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act                 :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions in all states
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act                 :   Mandated a three-tier system of urban local bodies
3. Government of Union Territories Act, 1963         :   Established the administrative framework for Union Territories
4. States Reorganisation Act, 1956                   :   Defined the boundaries of several states and Union Territories
5. 69th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1991      :   Granted special status to Delhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act is correctly paired with the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions across all Indian states, a crucial step in decentralizing governance.  The 74th Amendment Act correctly deals with the establishment of urban local bodies, although the three-tier system is a consequence of the act's provisions rather than a direct mandate in the text itself. The Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, accurately established the administrative structure for Union Territories. The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 played a significant role in defining the boundaries and structure of states and Union Territories within India. The 69th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1991 correctly granted special status to Delhi, which is a key part of its constitutional framework.

Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the accurate pairings of the Government of Union Territories Act, the States Reorganisation Act, and the 69th Amendment Act. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits three correctly matched pairs. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the 69th Amendment Act.  Therefore, only option (d) encompasses all the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the legislative framework concerning Panchayati Raj, urban local bodies, and the administrative structure of Union Territories, including Delhi's special status.  This showcases a strong grasp of Indian constitutional history and administrative systems.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Official                              Responsibility/Function
1. State Election Commissioner                        :   Conducts elections to Panchayati Raj institutions
2. State Finance Commission                           :   Reviews the financial position of local governments
3. Administrator                                        :   Executive head of a Union Territory (except Delhi)
4. Parliament                                          :   Legislates for Union Territories
5. President                                           :   Directly administers Union Territories

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The State Election Commissioner's role in conducting Panchayati Raj elections is a key feature of decentralization. The State Finance Commission's responsibility for reviewing the financial health of local governments ensures accountability and equitable resource allocation. The Administrator serves as the executive head of Union Territories, excluding Delhi, reflecting the unique administrative structure of these entities.  Parliament's legislative power over Union Territories is a fundamental aspect of the Indian federal system. Finally, the President's direct administration of Union Territories underscores the central government's control over these areas.  The accurate matching of all five pairs demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the institutional framework and power dynamics within the Indian administrative system, covering both rural and urban local governance and the distinct position of Union Territories.  This showcases a high level of factual recall and understanding of the intricate workings of Indian governance.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Urban Local Body Type                               Population/Characteristic
1. Municipal Corporation                               :   Established in cities with populations exceeding 10 million
2. Municipality                                         :   Governs smaller urban areas
3. Nagar Panchayat                                     :   Govern transitional areas between villages and towns
4. Bombay Municipal Corporation                      :   One of the first Municipal Corporations established during British rule
5. Calcutta Municipal Corporation                     :   One of the first Municipal Corporations established during British rule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

While the 74th Amendment Act mentions three types of municipalities, the precise population criteria for each type are not explicitly stated in the given text. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect because the provided text doesn't specify a population threshold of 10 million for Municipal Corporations. However, statements 2 and 3 are accurate descriptions of Municipalities and Nagar Panchayats, respectively, based on the text's characterizations of their respective functions and areas of jurisdiction. Statements 4 and 5 are also correct, as the text explicitly mentions Bombay and Calcutta Corporations as early examples of Municipal Corporations during the British era.  The correct answer, therefore, includes only the pairs that are definitively supported by the provided text.  This highlights the importance of precise factual recall and avoiding assumptions based on general knowledge, a crucial skill for UPSC aspirants. Choosing only the undeniably correct matches demonstrates a strong analytical approach and an ability to critically evaluate information.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Panchayat system:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act introduced the Panchayat system.
2. The Panchayat system envisages a three-tier system of local governance.
3. Panchayats are not provided for in states with populations under 2 million.
4. Gram Panchayats have a fixed term of three years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act is explicitly linked to the introduction of the Panchayat system.  Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly indicates that the Panchayat system envisions a three-tier structure.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The text does not specify a minimum population requirement for the establishment of Panchayats. Statement 4 is also incorrect. The provided text does not mention a three-year term for Gram Panchayats.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are definitively supported by the text.  This question tests the ability to discern factual accuracy from potentially misleading information, a critical skill for UPSC exam success. The inclusion of plausible distractors emphasizes the need for precise factual recall and careful evaluation of information.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Union Territory                         Characteristic
1. Delhi                                      :   Has its own Legislative Assembly
2. Pondicherry                               :   Has the highest sex ratio among Union Territories
3. Andaman and Nicobar Islands              :   Is part of the Union Territories
4. Lakshadweep                               :   Has the highest literacy rate among Union Territories
5. Goa                                       :   Was formerly a Union Territory

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, making statement 1 correct.  It also confirms that Andaman and Nicobar Islands are part of the Union Territories, making statement 3 correct. The text further mentions that Lakshadweep has the highest literacy rate among Union Territories, thus statement 4 is correct.  Additionally, the text mentions Goa as a former Union Territory, validating statement 5. However, while the text mentions Pondicherry, it does not explicitly state that it possesses the highest sex ratio among Union Territories, rendering statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are definitively supported by the given text.  This question necessitates precise factual recall and the ability to differentiate between explicit statements and implied inferences, a key skillset for the UPSC examination. The use of plausible but ultimately inaccurate distractors challenges the candidate to critically analyze and only select answers directly supported by the textual evidence.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body                     Enabling Act/Amendment
1. National Commission for Scheduled Castes :  The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950
2. National Commission for Scheduled Tribes  :  The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950
3. National Human Rights Commission        :  Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
4. National Commission for Backward Classes :  102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes are both constitutionally mandated bodies, although their specific powers and functions have evolved over time through subsequent legislation.  The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950, are crucial for understanding their initial establishment.  The National Human Rights Commission, however, is a statutory body established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not a constitutional body.  The National Commission for Backward Classes gained constitutional status through the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 2018, making it a constitutional body.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the constitutional or statutory nature of the bodies or incorrectly link them to their enabling legislation.  Option (d) accurately reflects the constitutional status of three of the four bodies and their correct pairings with the relevant legislation.  Understanding the distinction between constitutional and statutory bodies is vital for UPSC aspirants, as it reflects the level of protection and authority afforded to each.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article                  Body Established/Mandated
1. Article 324                               :   National Human Rights Commission
2. Article 338B                             :   National Commission for Backward Classes
3. Article 323A                             :   National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
4. Article 243(A)                           :   National Commission for Scheduled Castes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Article 338B of the Constitution of India specifically deals with the establishment of the National Commission for Backward Classes.  The other options present incorrect pairings. Article 324 pertains to the Election Commission of India, not the National Human Rights Commission. Article 323A relates to tribunals, not the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, though it influences the Commission's legal framework.  Article 243(A) is concerned with Gram Sabhas, not the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.  Therefore, only option (b) is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific constitutional provisions and their connection to various constitutional bodies. A thorough understanding of the Constitution's articles is crucial for success in the UPSC exam.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related constitutional provisions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                             Primary Function
1. Election Commission of India             :   Overseeing municipal elections
2. National Human Rights Commission        :   Protecting rights of minorities
3. National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission :  Regulating stock market transactions
4. Supreme Court of India                  :   Interpreting Article 142

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court of India is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, including Article 142, which grants it wide-ranging powers.  The other pairings are incorrect. While the Election Commission of India conducts elections, it does not primarily oversee municipal elections; these are typically handled by state election bodies.  The National Human Rights Commission's mandate is broader than just protecting the rights of minorities; it covers the human rights of all citizens.  The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission deals with consumer disputes, not stock market regulations.  Therefore, only option (c) correctly matches the Supreme Court's primary function with its constitutional role. The question tests understanding of the distinct roles and responsibilities of various governmental and quasi-governmental bodies, a crucial aspect of Indian Polity for the UPSC.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                           Ministry/Department
1. National Human Rights Commission       :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
2. National Commission for Backward Classes:   Ministry of Home Affairs
3. Tea Board                               :   Ministry of Commerce and Industry
4. Quality Council of India                 :   Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Tea Board is indeed under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The other options are incorrect. The National Human Rights Commission falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  The National Commission for Backward Classes is under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Quality Council of India is an autonomous body and not directly under any specific ministry, though it collaborates with various government departments.  Therefore, only option (b) correctly identifies the ministry associated with the Tea Board. This question tests the candidate's awareness of the administrative structure of India and the ministries responsible for various organizations.  Such knowledge is essential for understanding the policy-making process in India.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment                      Impact on Lok Sabha
1. 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976 :   Increased the number of seats
2. 44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978 :   Reduced the term to 6 years
3. 87th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003 :   Introduced anti-defection law
4. Delimitation Commission, 2008           :   Redrew constituency boundaries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Delimitation Commission, 2008, indeed redrew the constituency boundaries impacting the Lok Sabha's composition.  The other options are incorrect. The 42nd Amendment Act did not increase the number of Lok Sabha seats, although it did introduce certain provisions affecting the Parliament's functioning. The 44th Amendment Act restored the Lok Sabha's term to five years, not six. The 87th Amendment Act dealt with the right to education, not the Lok Sabha's structure or functioning.  Therefore, only option (c) represents a correct pairing. This question tests the candidate's understanding of Constitutional Amendments and their impact on the Lok Sabha, a key aspect of the Indian political system relevant to the UPSC exam.  The distractors use amendments that are related to the Lok Sabha in some way but are not directly matched with the described impacts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article              Office/Position
1. Article 76                         :   Solicitor General of India
2. Article 148                        :   Advocate General of a State
3. Article 165                        :   Comptroller and Auditor General of India
4. Article 280                        :   Attorney General of India
5. Article 338                        :   National Commission for Scheduled Castes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Article 280 of the Indian Constitution deals with the establishment of the Finance Commission.  The other pairs are incorrectly matched.  Article 76 establishes the office of the Attorney General of India, not the Solicitor General. The Solicitor General and Additional Solicitor General are appointed by the President but are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution itself. Article 148 pertains to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), not the Advocate General.  Article 165 establishes the office of the Advocate General for each state, not the CAG. Finally, Article 338 originally dealt with the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, which was later replaced by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  The National Commission for Scheduled Castes is established under Article 338A.  The inclusion of incorrect articles and positions in the distractors highlights the need for precise knowledge of constitutional provisions and the various offices they create.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related constitutional articles and offices.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                    Title/Position Held
1. C.K. Daphtary                         :   Solicitor General of India
2. M.C. Setalvad                          :   Comptroller and Auditor General of India
3.  Nani Palkhivala                       :   Attorney General of India
4.  K.M. Munshi                           :   Advocate General of a State

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Nani Palkhivala served as the Attorney General of India. The other pairs are incorrect. C.K. Daphtary held the position of Attorney General of India, not Solicitor General. M.C. Setalvad was also an Attorney General of India.  K.M. Munshi was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement and a member of the Constituent Assembly, but he did not serve as an Advocate General of a State. The question tests factual recall of prominent legal figures and their roles within the Indian government structure. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings requires careful consideration and a strong understanding of Indian legal history.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                      Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Appoints the Attorney General of India
2. Rajya Sabha                            :   Can initiate impeachment proceedings against the President
3. President                              :   Determines the remuneration of the Attorney General
4. Ministry of Law and Justice         :   Appoints the Advocate General of a State
5. Governor of a State                    :   Presides over the Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Rajya Sabha participates in the impeachment process of the President. The President of India determines the remuneration of the Attorney General. The other pairs are incorrect. The Lok Sabha does not appoint the Attorney General; it's the President. The Ministry of Law and Justice does not appoint the Advocate General of a State; that is the responsibility of the Governor. The Speaker presides over the Lok Sabha, not the Governor. This question tests the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different branches of the Indian government and their interactions. The distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the powers of the President, Parliament, and individual ministries.



**4. Consider the following statements:**

The Attorney General of India:

1. Is a member of the Central Cabinet
2. Can vote in the Lok Sabha
3. Has the right of audience in all courts in India
4. Can be removed by the President at any time


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The Attorney General of India has the right of audience in all courts in India.  The Attorney General holds office during the pleasure of the President and can therefore be removed at any time. Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. The Attorney General is not a member of the Central Cabinet.  The Attorney General can participate in parliamentary proceedings but does not have the right to vote.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Attorney General's powers, privileges, and limitations. The distractors include plausible but false statements about the Attorney General's position within the government and their participation in parliamentary proceedings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body               Report Presented to Parliament
1. Union Finance Commission           :  By the Prime Minister
2. Public Accounts Committee         :  By the President
3. Comptroller and Auditor General   :  By the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
4. National Commission for SCs       :  By the Attorney General

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The President of India is constitutionally mandated to lay the report of the Public Accounts Committee before Parliament.  The other pairs are incorrect. The President, not the Prime Minister, causes the recommendations of the Union Finance Commission to be laid before Parliament. The CAG's report is also laid before Parliament by the President, not the Speaker.  The National Commission for Scheduled Castes' report is presented to the President, who then lays it before Parliament, not the Attorney General.  This question tests knowledge of the constitutional process of presenting reports to Parliament and the role of the President in this process.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the specific responsibilities of different constitutional bodies.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Consolidated Fund of India and related entities.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Entity           Action Related to Consolidated Fund of India
1.  Contingency Fund of India:  Source of funds for unforeseen expenditure
2.  Public Account of India  :  Receives tax revenue from Union Territories
3.  Budget of India           :  Authorizes all withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund
4.  Appropriation Bill       :  Authorizes expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because statements 3 and 4 accurately reflect the relationship between the named entities and the Consolidated Fund of India.  The Appropriation Bill is crucial for authorizing the withdrawal of money from the Consolidated Fund, including expenditure charged upon it (which doesn't require a vote in Parliament).  The Budget of India, encompassing the Annual Financial Statement and Appropriation Bill, is the primary document that authorizes the government's spending from the Consolidated Fund.

Option (a) is incorrect. While the Contingency Fund can be used to meet unforeseen expenditure, it's not the *sole* source and its usage necessitates replenishment from the Consolidated Fund.

Option (b) is incorrect. Tax revenue from Union Territories is credited to the Consolidated Fund, not the Public Account. The Public Account holds various other funds, like small savings and provident funds.

Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in options 1 and 2 as explained above.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Consolidated Fund of India:**

1.  All receipts from taxes levied by the Union Government are directly credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The President of India can authorize withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund without parliamentary approval in certain exceptional circumstances.
3.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India audits the accounts of the Consolidated Fund of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is mostly correct.  While there might be minor exceptions, the vast majority of tax revenues received by the Union Government are indeed credited to the Consolidated Fund.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President cannot authorize withdrawals without parliamentary approval.  All money bills must be approved by Parliament. The only exception is the Contingency Fund, which can be used for emergencies, but it needs subsequent parliamentary approval for replenishment.

Statement 3 is correct. The CAG audits the accounts of the Consolidated Fund as part of its responsibility to audit government finances.


**3. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following pairs:**

   Recommendation Area           Finance Commission's Role
1.  Grants-in-aid to States     :   Determination of the specific amounts only
2.  Tax revenue distribution   :   Recommendation of principles and methodology
3.  Public Account of India      :   Allocation of funds from the Public Account to States
4.  Consolidated Fund of India :   Supervision of tax levy by Union and State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2,3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Finance Commission's primary role is to recommend the principles governing the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States and the methodology for this distribution. It doesn't specify exact amounts for grants-in-aid or directly allocate funds from the Public Account.  The Finance Commission also doesn't supervise tax levies; that's the role of the CAG.

The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the Finance Commission's powers and responsibilities.  It advises, but doesn't directly determine allocations or supervise tax collection.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body              Primary Function Related to Finance
1.  Finance Commission              :   Auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments
2.  Comptroller and Auditor General :   Recommending principles for tax revenue sharing
3.  Parliament                       :   Authorizing withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched. Parliament's primary financial function is authorizing the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India through the passage of money bills and appropriation bills.

The other options are incorrect as they incorrectly attribute functions.  The CAG audits, while the Finance Commission recommends revenue-sharing principles.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Subject Matter
1. Article 266                     :   Establishment of the Finance Commission
2. Article 280                     :   Definition of the Consolidated Fund of India
3. Article 112                     :   Procedure for the introduction of Money Bills
4. Article 360                     :   Financial Emergency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission, and Article 360 deals with the declaration of a Financial Emergency.  Article 266 defines the Consolidated Fund of India, and Article 112 deals with the Annual Financial Statement.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options include incorrect pairings.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Body                     Characteristic Feature
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Nominated members participate in impeachment proceedings but not in elections.
2. Rajya Sabha                           :   Represents states and union territories proportionally.
3. State Legislative Assembly           :   Term can be extended by Parliament during a National Emergency.
4. Karnataka State Legislative Assembly:   Normal term is five years.
5. Mizoram State Legislative Assembly :   Dissolved by the Governor.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct.  The nominated members of Parliament participate in the impeachment process of the President, a crucial aspect of parliamentary procedure,  but they do not participate in the President's election, which involves a different electoral college. This highlights the distinct roles and powers within the legislative framework.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While Rajya Sabha represents states and union territories, its representation is not strictly proportional to population. It's based on a formula that considers both population and statehood, leading to unequal representation per capita.

Pair 3 is correct. The Indian Constitution empowers Parliament to extend the term of State Legislative Assemblies during a National Emergency, a crucial provision during times of national crisis. This exemplifies the federal structure's flexibility and the supremacy of Parliament in such situations.

Pair 4 is correct. State Legislative Assemblies typically have a five-year term, a fundamental aspect of their constitutional setup.  This ensures a regular cycle of elections and accountability to the electorate.

Pair 5 is correct. The Governor, as the head of the state executive, has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly under specific constitutional provisions, primarily when a government loses its majority support or faces a severe crisis. This power acts as a check and balance within the state's political system.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                  Power or Function
1. Election Commission of India       :   Appoints Returning Officers.
2. Union Public Service Commission    :   Advises the President.
3. State Public Service Commission     :   Removed by the President.
4. Joint Public Service Commission    :    Established by Parliament on request of concerned states.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct. The Election Commission of India (ECI) plays a crucial role in the conduct of elections and possesses the power to appoint Returning Officers, who are responsible for overseeing the election process at the constituency level. This demonstrates the ECI's authority and its role in ensuring free and fair elections.

Pair 2 is correct. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) provides crucial advice to the President on matters relating to appointments, promotions, and other service-related issues within the Union government. This advisory role underscores the UPSC's importance in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the civil services.

Pair 3 is correct.  Members of a State Public Service Commission can be removed by the President of India, highlighting the constitutional balance of power.  This mechanism ensures accountability and allows for the removal of members whose actions are deemed unsuitable.

Pair 4 is correct. A Joint Public Service Commission for two or more states can be established by an Act of Parliament if requested by the concerned states. This illustrates the flexibility of the Indian federal structure, allowing for inter-state cooperation in administrative matters.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                     Action/Power
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Passes the Appropriation Bill.
2. Rajya Sabha                           :    Can initiate removal of the Vice-President.
3. Parliament                           :   Determines the emoluments of the President.
4. Council of Ministers                 :   Responsible to the Lok Sabha.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct. The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament, plays a crucial role in the financial matters of the government.  The Appropriation Bill, which authorizes the government's spending, must be passed by the Lok Sabha.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's control over the executive's financial decisions.

Pair 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha, along with the Lok Sabha, can initiate the process of removing the Vice-President through impeachment. This power demonstrates the Rajya Sabha's role in maintaining the integrity of the executive branch.

Pair 3 is correct.  Parliament, through its legislative powers, determines the emoluments, allowances, and privileges of the President of India. This reflects the constitutional arrangement where Parliament controls the President's financial aspects.

Pair 4 is correct. The Council of Ministers, the executive branch of the Indian government, is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. This means the Council must maintain the confidence of the Lok Sabha; otherwise, it faces the risk of losing power through a no-confidence motion. This underlines the principle of parliamentary accountability.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure/Body                Action/Responsibility
1. Governor                               :   Dissolves the State Legislative Assembly.
2. President                             :   Administers the oath of office to the President. 
3. Chief Justice of India                :   Acts as President when both President and Vice-President's offices are vacant.
4. Prime Minister                        :    Elected by the Lok Sabha.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct. The Governor, as the head of the state executive, possesses the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly. This power acts as an important check and balance mechanism within the state's political system.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Chief Justice of India administers the oath of office to the President, not the President himself.

Pair 3 is correct. In the event of vacancies in both the President and Vice-President's offices, the Chief Justice of India (or the seniormost judge available) assumes the presidential role. This constitutional provision ensures continuity of the executive power.


Pair 4 is incorrect. The Prime Minister is not directly elected by the Lok Sabha.  The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, typically the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Lok Sabha.  The Lok Sabha, however, indirectly plays a role as the Prime Minister needs to maintain its confidence to remain in office.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                         Provision Related To
1. 42nd Amendment Act of 1976          :   Froze seat allocation in Lok Sabha.
2. 44th Amendment Act of 1978          :   Restored provisions for Lok Sabha's term.
3. 87th Amendment Act of 2003          :   Did not alter seat allocation in Lok Sabha.
4. First Amendment Act, 1951           :   Modified representation in Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 temporarily froze the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha based on the 1971 census. This was done to address concerns about population changes impacting representation.

Pair 2 is correct. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 reversed some of the changes introduced by the 42nd Amendment, including restoring the original provisions related to the term of the Lok Sabha, which had been altered during the emergency.

Pair 3 is correct. The 87th Amendment Act of 2003 did not alter the basic structure of Lok Sabha seat allocation.  While it dealt with other constitutional matters, it left the seat allocation largely unchanged.

Pair 4 is correct. The First Amendment Act of 1951 made changes to the representation in Lok Sabha, addressing certain concerns regarding the composition of the house.  These amendments were done to refine the electoral system.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Key Function/Characteristic
1. Union Public Service Commission       :   Conducts examinations for All-India Services
2. State Public Service Commission       :   Advises the Governor on appointments to state services
3. Comptroller and Auditor General of India :   Audits government accounts at both the Union and State levels
4. Finance Commission                     :   Makes recommendations on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States
5. Election Commission of India           :   Conducts elections to Parliament and State Legislatures

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched.  The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is the central recruiting agency for All-India Services and other central government positions.  State Public Service Commissions (SPSCs) perform a similar function at the state level, advising the Governor on appointments and other service matters. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is the supreme auditor of India, responsible for auditing the accounts of both the Union and State governments. The Finance Commission, established under Article 280 of the Constitution, is tasked with making recommendations on the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and duties between the Union and the States. Finally, the Election Commission of India (ECI) is an independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures.  Each body plays a crucial role in the Indian administrative and political system, upholding the principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                    Provision Related To
1. Government of India Act, 1935          :   Establishment of Joint Public Service Commissions
2. Forty-First Amendment Act, 1976        :   Retirement age of UPSC members
3. Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010 :  Protection of historical sites
4. Representation of People Act, 1951    :   Conduct of elections
5. Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957:   Domicile requirements for government jobs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Government of India Act, 1935, laid the groundwork for the establishment of Joint Public Service Commissions, enabling the sharing of administrative resources across multiple states.  The Forty-First Amendment Act, 1976, addressed the retirement age of members of the Union Public Service Commission and other related constitutional bodies. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, is related to the preservation and protection of ancient monuments and archaeological sites in India. The Representation of People Act, 1951, is the primary legislation governing the conduct of elections in India. Finally, the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, deals with the residence requirements often associated with public employment in India. Therefore, option (b) encompassing all five pairs is the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India appoints the Chairman and Members of the Finance Commission.
2.  The Parliament plays a role in the removal of judges of the Supreme Court.
3.  Parliament does not play any role in the removal of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.
4.  Sukumar Sen was the first Chief Election Commissioner of India.
5.  The Model Code of Conduct is enacted by Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The President of India appoints the Chairman and Members of the Finance Commission as per the Constitution.  The Parliament plays a crucial role in the removal of Supreme Court judges through impeachment proceedings. Sukumar Sen was indeed the first Chief Election Commissioner of India. However, statements 3 and 5 are incorrect. Parliament *does* play a role in the removal of the CAG,  and the Model Code of Conduct is not enacted by Parliament but is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India before elections.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate, making (a) the correct option.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Official/Body              Removal Process Involves
1. Judges of the Supreme Court             :   Impeachment by Parliament
2. Comptroller and Auditor General of India:   Removal by Presidential order based on Parliament’s resolution
3. Chairman, Union Public Service Commission:  Removal by Presidential order based on Parliament’s resolution
4.  Member, State Public Service Commission:  Removal by the Governor after an inquiry by the High Court
5.  Chief Election Commissioner           : Removal by Presidential order based on Parliament’s resolution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The removal of Supreme Court judges involves a complex impeachment process by Parliament. The CAG and the UPSC Chairman's removal involves a parliamentary resolution that leads to Presidential action.  A member of the State Public Service Commission can be removed by the Governor following a High Court inquiry. The Chief Election Commissioner's removal also follows a similar process as the CAG and the UPSC Chairman. Hence, option (b) is the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                      Significant Event Regarding Auditing/Accounting
1. 1976                                     :   Forty-First Amendment Act modified retirement age of CAG
2. 1975                                     :  Accounting separated from auditing for the CAG
3. 1981                                     :  CAG's role solely confined to auditing government accounts
4. 1935                                     : Establishment of the office of the Auditor General of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched.  While the Forty-First Amendment of 1976 did make changes to the Indian Constitution, it didn't directly relate to the CAG's functions or retirement age. The separation of accounting and auditing functions of the CAG happened in 1976, not 1975.  The year 1981 is also not directly associated with a significant change to the CAG's role. However, it was in 1976 that the CAG's role was primarily confined to auditing government accounts, and this separation of accounting and auditing functions is a crucial aspect of the CAG's history and evolution. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.  The establishment of the Auditor General's office predates 1935, making option 4 incorrect.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Extra-Constitutional Body               Characteristic
1. NITI Aayog                             :   Established by a Government resolution
2. Finance Commission                     :   Constitutional mandate but specific composition not detailed in the Constitution
3. Election Commission of India             :   Independent constitutional body
4. Union Public Service Commission         :   Constitutional body with detailed composition specified in the Constitution
5. Joint Public Service Commission         : Established by an act of Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. NITI Aayog is an extra-constitutional body established by a government resolution. The Finance Commission has a constitutional basis (Article 280) but the details of its composition are not explicitly defined in the Constitution. The Election Commission of India is an independent and crucial constitutional body.  The UPSC is also a constitutional body with a detailed composition specified in the Constitution. However, the Joint Public Service Commission is established through an Act of Parliament, and not a constitutional body. Therefore, only options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party                  Event/Characteristic Related to Parliament
1. Indian National Congress          :   Majority in the first Lok Sabha
2. Swatantra Party                   :   Largest opposition party in the first Lok Sabha
3.  Communist Party of India          :  Played a significant role in early Lok Sabha debates
4.  Bharatiya Janata Party           :  Majority in the 17th Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Indian National Congress held a clear majority in the first Lok Sabha.  The Swatantra Party was the largest opposition party in the first Lok Sabha. The Communist Party of India was a significant player in the early Lok Sabha and participated actively in parliamentary debates.  The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved a majority in the 17th Lok Sabha. Each pairing reflects a historically accurate relationship between a specific political party and its role or position within the Indian Parliament.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Subject Matter
1. Article 3                         :    Formation of new states
2. Article 17                        :   Abolition of untouchability
3. Article 21                        :   Right to life and personal liberty
4. Article 356                       :   President's rule in states
5. Article 368                       :   Amendment of the Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution deals with the formation of new states and alteration of boundaries. Article 17 abolishes untouchability. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. Article 356 allows for the imposition of President's rule in a state under certain circumstances.  Article 368 outlines the process for amending the Constitution.  Each of these articles plays a significant role in the structure and functioning of the Indian Constitution and government; therefore, all pairings are accurate.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Schedule                                    Subject Matter
1. First Schedule                           :   States and Union Territories
2. Second Schedule                          :   Salaries of the President, Governors, etc.
3. Third Schedule                           :   Forms of Oaths or Affirmations
4. Fourth Schedule                           :   Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha
5. Fifth Schedule                           :   Administration of Scheduled Areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The First Schedule lists the states and union territories of India. The Second Schedule specifies the salaries and allowances of the President, Governors, and other high-ranking officials. The Third Schedule details the forms of oaths or affirmations to be taken by various constitutional office holders. The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha, representing different states. The Fifth Schedule outlines the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes.  Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer, as all pairings are accurate reflections of the content of the respective schedules within the Indian Constitution.



**10. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                            Special Provision/Procedure
1. Money Bill                             :   Originates in Lok Sabha only
2. Ordinary Bill                           :   Can be introduced in either House
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill          :   Requires special majority for passage
4. Financial Bill                          :   Deals with matters other than taxation and borrowing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Money Bills, as per Article 110 of the Constitution, must originate in the Lok Sabha. Ordinary Bills can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. Constitutional Amendment Bills require a special majority (Article 368) for their passage.  Statement 4 is incorrect; Financial Bills deal with taxation and borrowing but also encompass other financial matters. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate, and the correct answer is (a).  The other options incorrectly include statement 4.


**11. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative List                     Power Vested In
1. Union List                            :   Parliament
2. State List                             :   State Legislatures
3. Concurrent List                       :   Both Parliament and State Legislatures (Parliament has overriding power)
4. Residuary Powers                      :   Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Union List, under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, lists subjects on which only the Parliament can legislate. The State List contains subjects on which only the state legislatures can make laws. The Concurrent List has subjects on which both the Parliament and state legislatures can legislate, but in case of conflict, the Parliament's law prevails.  Residuary powers, or subjects not explicitly mentioned in either of the lists, are vested in the Parliament. This division of legislative powers forms the cornerstone of the Indian federal structure.  Therefore, option (a) is correct.


**12.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee of Parliament                    Function
1. Public Accounts Committee                 :   Examines the audit reports of the CAG
2. Estimates Committee                       :   Scrutinizes the budget estimates
3. Committee on Public Undertakings           :   Examines the working of public sector undertakings
4. Committee on Subordinate Legislation      :   Reviews delegated legislation
5. Committee on Government Assurances        :   Monitors implementation of government assurances

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Public Accounts Committee examines the audit reports submitted by the CAG and holds the executive accountable. The Estimates Committee scrutinizes the budget estimates presented by the government. The Committee on Public Undertakings examines the working of public sector undertakings, assessing their efficiency and effectiveness. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation reviews delegated legislation to ensure that it remains within the bounds of the powers delegated by Parliament. Finally, the Committee on Government Assurances monitors whether the government is fulfilling its promises made in Parliament.  These committees are instrumental in parliamentary oversight of the executive and the administrative processes.  Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

    Governor's Power/Function             Related Constitutional Article
1. Appointment of State Election Commissioner: Article 243 K
2. Pardon, reprieve, respite, remission or commutation of punishment: Article 161
3. Power to dissolve State Legislative Assembly : Article 174
4.  Assent to Bills passed by the State Legislature: Article 200
5.  Appointment of Judges to High Courts    : Article 217


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Article 161 grants the Governor the power of pardon, reprieve, etc. Article 200 deals with the Governor's power to assent to, or withhold assent from, or return bills passed by the State Legislature. Article 217 relates to the appointment of High Court judges.  However, the appointment of the State Election Commissioner is not directly covered by Article 243K; it falls under the Governor’s powers.  The Governor's power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly is also not exclusively covered by Article 174, which primarily deals with the session of the State Legislature.  Therefore, only options 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**14. Which of the following is/are not necessarily a consequence of the proclamation of President's Rule in a state?**

(a) Dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly
(b) Removal of the State Council of Ministers
(c) Suspension of Fundamental Rights in the State
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly and the removal of the State Council of Ministers are common practices under President's Rule (Article 356), the suspension of Fundamental Rights is not a necessary consequence. President's rule is invoked when a state's constitutional machinery breaks down, and while it involves taking over the state government's functions, the fundamental rights of citizens are not automatically suspended. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the imposition of President's Rule should be a last resort and should not be used to curtail fundamental rights unnecessarily.  Therefore, only (c) is not a necessary consequence.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   First Chief Election Commissioner     Year of Appointment
1. Sukumar Sen                          :   1950
2. T. Swaminathan                       :   1958
3. K.V.K. Sundaram                        :   1967
4. S. P. Sen Verma                       :   1972

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Sukumar Sen was appointed the first Chief Election Commissioner in 1950, establishing the office. The subsequent Chief Election Commissioners, T. Swaminathan, K.V.K. Sundaram, and S. P. Sen Verma, held office in the years indicated.  This sequence reflects the historical timeline of the Chief Election Commissioners of India.  The other options incorrectly omit one or more of these accurately matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Provision related to Municipalities       Constitutional Amendment
1.  Reservation of seats for SCs and STs in proportion to their population in municipal areas : 73rd Amendment
2.  Mandatory periodic elections every 5 years                                              : 74th Amendment
3.  One-third of seats reserved for women (excluding SC/ST women reservations)           : 74th Amendment
4.  Procedure for maintenance of accounts and audit decided by the State Governor          : 73rd Amendment
5. Constitution of Nagar Panchayats for smaller urban areas                               : 74th Amendment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 74th Amendment Act of the Constitution deals with the organization of Municipalities.  Option (b) correctly identifies three key provisions introduced by this amendment.  The 74th Amendment mandates periodic elections every five years (pair 2), reserves one-third of seats for women (excluding those reserved for SC/ST women) (pair 3), and empowers the constitution of Nagar Panchayats for smaller urban areas (pair 5).  While the reservation of seats for SCs and STs in proportion to their population is a crucial feature of local body governance, it's not exclusively linked to the 74th Amendment; the principle applies across various levels of local governance and is reinforced by other legislation. The procedure for maintenance of accounts and audit is largely determined by state laws and not specifically dictated by a single constitutional amendment, though the 73rd and 74th amendments provide a framework for such processes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body          Primary Function
1.  State Finance Commission     :   Recommending financial assistance to Panchayats
2.  Union Finance Commission    :   Determining the principles governing grants-in-aid to States
3.  Election Commission         :   Conducting elections to the President and Vice-President
4.  Public Service Commission  :   Recruiting and managing civil servants at the state level
5.  State Public Service Commission :  Recommending financial assistance to Municipalities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Finance Commission's primary role is to define principles governing grants-in-aid to states (pair 2).  The Election Commission is constitutionally mandated to conduct presidential and vice-presidential elections (pair 3).  State Public Service Commissions are responsible for recruitment and management of state civil servants (pair 4).  While State Finance Commissions deal with the financial distribution within states, they don't directly recommend financial assistance to Panchayats; their function is broader, concerning the distribution of resources among different tiers of local government.   The function of recommending financial assistance to Municipalities is not a primary function of any of the listed constitutional bodies.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment        Key Provision
1.  61st Amendment                 :   Lowered the voting age to 18 years
2.  63rd Amendment                 :   Provided for reservation of seats for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha
3.  73rd Amendment                 :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
4.  74th Amendment                 :   Established Municipalities
5.  42nd Amendment                :   Added "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 61st Amendment lowered the voting age to 18 (pair 1).  The 73rd Amendment established Panchayati Raj Institutions (pair 3). The 74th Amendment established Municipalities (pair 4). The 42nd Amendment added "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble (pair 5).  The 63rd Amendment dealt with reservation of seats for SCs and STs, but not exclusively in the Lok Sabha; it affected other legislative bodies as well. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Office/Position                   Primary Responsibility
1.  Lokayukta                       :   Investigating complaints of corruption against public officials
2.  Comptroller and Auditor General :   Auditing government accounts and ensuring financial accountability
3.  Governor                         :   Appointing the Chief Minister
4.  Chief Minister                  :   Head of the State Government
5.  President                       :   Appointing the Governor


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Lokayukta investigates corruption allegations (pair 1). The CAG audits government accounts (pair 2). The Governor appoints the Chief Minister (pair 3). The Chief Minister heads the state government (pair 4). The President appoints the Governor (pair 5).  These are all fundamental aspects of the Indian administrative and governmental structure.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept of Human Rights            Emphasis
1.  Right to Property                 :   Economic Security
2.  Right to Equality                 :   Social Justice
3.  Right to Religion                :   Freedom of Conscience
4.  Dignity of Man as a Human Being :   Inherent Worth and Value
5.  Right to Life and Personal Liberty :  Protection from arbitrary state action


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the connections in pairs 1 and 2 are somewhat less direct than the others, all the pairs in options (d) are fundamentally correct.  The right to property is related to economic security, but it is not the primary emphasis. Similarly, the right to equality is linked to social justice but is not exclusively focused on it. However, the right to religion does directly emphasize freedom of conscience (pair 3), and the dignity of man as a human being is centrally about inherent worth and value (pair 4).  The right to life and personal liberty is especially connected to protection from arbitrary state action (pair 5). Therefore, option (d) encompasses the most accurate and direct relationships among the pairs presented.  Options (a), (b), and (c) omit crucial pairs showcasing the core principles of human rights.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Reform                                     Key Feature
1. Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms                  :   Introduction of Dyarchy in provinces
2. Government of India Act, 1919              :   Establishment of Public Service Commission
3. Government of India Act, 1935              :   Introduction of Provincial Autonomy
4. Indian Councils Act, 1892                   :   Expansion of Legislative Councils

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, which formed the basis for the Government of India Act, 1919, introduced the system of Dyarchy in the provinces.  This system divided the provincial government's functions into "reserved" subjects (controlled by the Governor) and "transferred" subjects (controlled by the ministers responsible to the legislature).  The Government of India Act, 1919, also established the Public Service Commission to oversee recruitment and appointments to the civil services, a significant step towards professionalizing the bureaucracy. The Government of India Act, 1935, a landmark piece of legislation, introduced provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance powers to the provinces.  While the Indian Councils Act, 1892, did lead to some expansion of the legislative councils, it didn't introduce any of the major structural changes seen in the other acts. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government of India Act                             Impact on Governance
1. Government of India Act, 1919                    :   Establishment of a bicameral legislature at the center
2. Government of India Act, 1935                    :   Introduction of federal structure
3. Government of India Act, 1919                    :   Increased Indian representation in the central legislature
4. Government of India Act, 1935                    :   Establishment of a federal court

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced a significant reform by establishing a bicameral legislature at the center, comprising the Council of State (upper house) and the Legislative Assembly (lower house). This Act also increased Indian representation in the central legislature, although it still fell short of full self-rule.  The Government of India Act, 1935, marked a crucial step towards a federal structure by establishing a federation with both central and provincial legislatures.  The Act also established a Federal Court, a significant judicial development within the framework of the Indian governance system.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  The 1919 Act's expansion of the legislature and the 1935 Act's creation of a federal system are key features of their respective impacts on Indian governance.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                                 Key Function
1. Election Commission of India                        :   Delimitation of constituencies
2. Comptroller and Auditor General of India           :   Auditing the accounts of public sector undertakings
3. Union Public Service Commission                    :   Recruitment to All India Services
4. Finance Commission                               :   Recommending the principles governing grants-in-aid to states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India audits the accounts of all government bodies, including public sector undertakings, to ensure financial accountability. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is primarily responsible for recruitment to various All India Services and other central government services. The Finance Commission is tasked with recommending the principles governing the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States and the allocation of grants-in-aid to States.  While the Election Commission of India (ECI) conducts elections and oversees the electoral process, the delimitation of constituencies is the responsibility of the Delimitation Commission, a separate body established under the Delimitation Commission Act. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government of India Act                         Specific Provision
1. Government of India Act, 1919                   :   Introduction of diarchy in provinces
2. Government of India Act, 1935                   :   Establishment of a Federal Court
3. Government of India Act, 1919                   :   Establishment of a bicameral legislature
4. Government of India Act, 1935                   :   Provision for Provincial Autonomy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced the system of dyarchy, dividing power between elected ministers and the Governor. The Government of India Act, 1935, established a Federal Court as part of its federal structure. The 1919 Act also established a bicameral legislature at the central level. The 1935 Act provided for significant provincial autonomy, giving more power to the provinces. Hence, all four pairs are correctly matched, reflecting key features of these acts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Historical Act/Event                                  Impact

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Pitt's India Act of 1784 established the Board of Control to oversee the East India Company's affairs, marking a crucial step in British government control over India.  The Regulating Act of 1773 established the Supreme Court in Calcutta, aiming to improve the administration of justice.  The Charter Act of 1833 significantly altered the East India Company's role by abolishing its monopoly in trade, opening up the market to other British companies. The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced the system of dyarchy in the provinces, a key feature of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, reflecting significant legislative and administrative developments in British India.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act                       Specific Provision
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act                 :   Establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act                 :   Establishment of Nagar Palikas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act is pivotal for establishing Panchayati Raj Institutions at the village level, empowering local self-governance.  The 74th Amendment Act similarly focuses on establishing urban local bodies, known as Nagar Palikas or Municipalities.  The 101st Amendment Act introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system in India, a major reform in indirect taxation.  The 103rd Amendment Act introduced a 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in educational institutions and government jobs.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, showcasing the significant constitutional amendments and their related provisions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Fund                        Key Characteristic
1. Consolidated Fund of India                         :   Receives all tax revenue of the Union Government
2. Contingency Fund of India                         :   Meant for unforeseen expenditures
3. Public Account of India                           :   Houses various government funds and accounts
4. National Small Savings Fund                       :  Managed by the Government of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India is the primary repository for all government revenues, including tax receipts and other sources of income. The Contingency Fund of India is a reserve fund established to meet unforeseen and urgent expenditures, providing flexibility in financial management. The Public Account of India houses various funds and accounts, including those related to small savings, provident funds, and other government transactions. The National Small Savings Fund is a significant component of the public debt, managed by the government. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, highlighting the key functions and characteristics of these financial institutions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  Legislative Body                                      Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                                          :   Initiating Money Bills
2. Rajya Sabha                                         :   Amending the Constitution
3. Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha)           :   Removal of the President
4. State Legislative Assembly                         :   Passing State Budgets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha, as the lower house of Parliament, holds the exclusive power to initiate money bills, reflecting its financial authority. The Rajya Sabha plays a crucial role in the constitutional amendment process, as its concurrence is required.  Both houses of Parliament together constitute the legislative body that can remove the President through impeachment proceedings. State Legislative Assemblies are responsible for passing their respective state budgets. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating the powers and functions of these legislative bodies.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Official/Body                           Specific Responsibility

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Chief Election Commissioner, ensuring the independence of the election body. The Prime Minister advises the President on the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), a key constitutional official. Parliament plays a crucial role in approving the Union Budget, exercising its financial powers. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union Government, ensuring accountability and transparency in government finances.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating the crucial roles and responsibilities of these key governmental players.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article                                 Subject Matter

2. Article 324                                          :   Election Commission of India
3. Article 266                                          :   Consolidated Fund of India
4. Article 243                                          :   Panchayats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 148 of the Indian Constitution deals with the establishment and functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). Article 324 pertains to the Election Commission of India, outlining its composition, powers, and functions. Article 266 specifically addresses the Consolidated Fund of India, the primary repository of government revenues.  Article 243, however, deals with Panchayats and not the other subjects mentioned in the pairs.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                         Key Characteristic
1. NITI Aayog                               :   Full-time Vice-Chairperson
2. Planning Commission                       :   Operated under cooperative federalism
3. National Development Council (NDC)       :   Replaced by NITI Aayog
4.  Union Cabinet                           : Established NITI Aayog


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because the National Development Council (NDC) was indeed replaced by NITI Aayog, and the Union Cabinet, being the highest decision-making body of the Government of India, is responsible for establishing NITI Aayog.  NITI Aayog does have a full-time Vice-Chairperson, a crucial part of its structure. However,  the Planning Commission did not primarily operate under the principle of cooperative federalism; while it consulted with states, its decision-making process was often criticized as top-down. Therefore, pairing the Planning Commission with cooperative federalism is inaccurate.  The other options are incorrect due to the mismatched pairs explained above.  Understanding the evolution from the Planning Commission to NITI Aayog, including the change in governance structure and federal dynamics, is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of Indian economic policymaking.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                             Role/Function
1. NITI Aayog                               :   Replaced the National Development Council
2. Planning Commission                       :   Formulated Five-Year Plans for India
3.  National Institute for Transforming India: Full-time Chairman
4.  Government of India                     : Established the Planning Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because NITI Aayog did indeed replace the National Development Council (NDC) in its role of coordinating national development strategies. The Planning Commission was the primary body responsible for formulating India's Five-Year Plans, a core aspect of its function. The Government of India established the Planning Commission.  Pairing the National Institute for Transforming India with a "Full-time Chairman" is incorrect, while NITI Aayog is headed by the Prime Minister, who is not a full-time chairman in the same sense as the head of a private corporation.  The other options are incorrect as they include mismatched pairs.  This question tests knowledge of the institutional evolution of Indian planning and the roles played by different government bodies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                            Relationship to NITI Aayog
1. State Governments                         :   Equal partners in policy-making
2. Planning Commission                       :   Preceded NITI Aayog
3. Parliament                               :   Created NITI Aayog
4. Central Government                        :   Receives recommendations from NITI Aayog


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. NITI Aayog explicitly aims for equal partnership with state governments in policy-making, a significant departure from the Planning Commission's top-down approach. The Planning Commission indeed preceded NITI Aayog. NITI Aayog makes recommendations to the Central Government, influencing policy.  The statement that Parliament created NITI Aayog is incorrect; it was established by the Government of India, a distinction crucial to understanding the body's non-constitutional nature. The other options incorrectly include the mismatched pair involving Parliament.  This question tests the understanding of NITI Aayog's role within the Indian federal structure and its relationship with other governmental bodies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                                    Role related to NITI Aayog
1. Prime Minister of India                   :   Full-time Chairman of NITI Aayog
2. Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog             :   Appointed by the President
3. Chief Ministers of all the States         :   Members of NITI Aayog
4.  Members of the NITI Aayog               :  Appointed by the Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The Prime Minister of India is the Chairperson (not full-time Chairman) of NITI Aayog, a key aspect of its structure. Chief Ministers of all states are members of NITI Aayog, reflecting its federal character. The other pairs are incorrect. The Vice-Chairman is appointed by the Prime Minister, not the President. The members of NITI Aayog are not appointed by the Lok Sabha; their appointment process involves the Prime Minister and other relevant authorities. The other options include these incorrect pairings.  This question requires understanding the composition and leadership of NITI Aayog and the roles of key individuals within the organization.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Action Related to NITI Aayog
1. Central Government                           :   Replaced the Planning Commission with NITI Aayog
2. Planning Commission                          :   Was replaced by NITI Aayog
3. State/Ministry                              : Coordinates with NITI Aayog
4.  Union Cabinet                               :  Created NITI Aayog


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer. The central government played a key role in the transition from the Planning Commission to NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission was indeed replaced by NITI Aayog, marking a significant shift in India's development planning.  NITI Aayog coordinates with various State/Ministries as part of its collaborative federalism approach. The statement that the Union Cabinet *created* NITI Aayog is a nuanced point. While the Cabinet approved its formation,  the precise phrasing implies a more direct role than what actually occurred.  The other options are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair involving the Union Cabinet. The question tests understanding of the institutional changes and the roles of different parts of the Indian government.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                           Relationship with the President of India
1. Union Public Service Commission         :   Appoints the Chairman and Members
2. Comptroller and Auditor General of India :   Appoints the Chairman
3. Chief Election Commissioner              :   Appoints based on the advice of the Prime Minister
4.  Council of Ministers                     :  Advises the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner based on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers advises the President on various matters of governance.  The other pairs are incorrect.  The President appoints the Chairman and Members of the UPSC. The President appoints the Comptroller and Auditor General, not just the Chairman. The other options mistakenly include the incorrect pairs. This question tests knowledge of the President's role in appointing key constitutional and governmental officials.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                         Power/Function
1. President of India                       :   Can dissolve the Lok Sabha
2. Prime Minister                          :   Appoints the Chief Election Commissioner
3. Governor of a State                      :   Appoints the Chief Minister
4.  Chief Justice of India                  : Can dismiss the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The President of India has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha.  The Governor of a state appoints the Chief Minister. The other pairs are incorrect. The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Chief Justice of India cannot dismiss the President; the President can only be removed through impeachment by Parliament. The other options incorrectly include these pairings. This question tests the understanding of the powers and functions of different high-ranking officials within the Indian governmental structure.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Political Body                             Electoral System Used
1. Lok Sabha                                 :   Proportional Representation
2. Rajya Sabha                               :   Proportional Representation
3. President of India                         :   Proportional Representation
4.  State Legislative Councils                 : First-Past-the-Post


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Rajya Sabha uses a system of proportional representation. The election of the President of India also employs proportional representation. The Lok Sabha uses the First-Past-the-Post system, and State Legislative Councils also utilize different systems which are not necessarily First-Past-the-Post. The other options contain mismatched pairs. This question assesses understanding of different electoral systems used in India at various levels of government.  The nuanced understanding of the application of proportional representation is key here.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                           Location/Jurisdiction
1. NITI Aayog                               :   New Delhi
2. Planning Commission                       :   Mumbai
3. Central Vigilance Commission              :   Kolkata
4.  Union Public Service Commission          : Chennai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only option (a) is correct. NITI Aayog is located in New Delhi. The other locations are incorrect. The Planning Commission was also located in New Delhi. The Central Vigilance Commission and the Union Public Service Commission are both located in New Delhi. The other options mistakenly include the incorrect locations. This question tests factual knowledge about the locations of key Indian governmental bodies.  Knowing the locations helps place these bodies within the broader context of Indian administration.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

     Act/Amendment                             Key Provision Related to the Executive
1. 42nd Constitutional Amendment             :   Made Ministerial advice binding on the President
2. 44th Constitutional Amendment             :   Strengthened the power of the Prime Minister
3. Government of India Act, 1935            :   Established a bicameral legislature
4.  Constitution of India                     :  Established the office of the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act made the advice of the Council of Ministers binding on the President in most matters, significantly altering the balance of power. The Constitution of India established the office of the President, defining its powers and functions.  The 44th Amendment did not primarily strengthen the Prime Minister's power; instead, it focused on other aspects of the Constitution. The Government of India Act, 1935, established a bicameral legislature at the federal level, but it's not directly related to executive power in the same way as the other options. The other options contain mismatched pairs. This question tests the understanding of key constitutional amendments impacting the executive branch's powers and structure.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                      Associated Act/Legislation
1. Central Vigilance Commission     :     Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947
2. Central Bureau of Investigation  :     Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946
3. Union Public Service Commission  :     Government of India Act, 1919
4. State Public Service Commission   :     Government of India Act, 1935

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) was established in 2003 under the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003.  While the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, falls under its superintendence, the 1947 Act is not directly related to its establishment. The  CBI's origins are rooted in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, making option 2 correct.  The UPSC's roots trace back to the 1919 Act. However, the 1935 Act is associated with the establishment of the Joint Public Service Commission, not the State Public Service Commission. The State Public Service Commissions were established under the Government of India Act, 1935, thus making option 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                  Appointing Authority
1. Chief Justice of India             :     Parliament
2. Comptroller and Auditor General :     President of India
3. Governor of a State               :     Prime Minister of India
4.  Union Public Service Commission Chairman:  Governor of a State


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India, not Parliament. The President also appoints the Comptroller and Auditor General, making option 2 correct.  The President, not the Prime Minister, appoints the Governors of states. The Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission is appointed by the President, not the Governor of a State.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they contain at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body             Key Function/Responsibility
1. Finance Commission               :    Manages the Contingency Fund of India
2. Election Commission of India     :    Conducts elections for the President of India
3.  Union Public Service Commission:    Appoints Ministers to the Council of Ministers
4.  State Public Service Commission :    Conducts recruitment for the All India Services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission advises on the distribution of financial resources between the Union and states; it does not manage the Contingency Fund. The Election Commission conducts elections for the President, making option 2 correct. The Council of Ministers is appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister; the UPSC is not involved in this process. The State Public Service Commission conducts recruitment for state services, not the All India Services (which is the UPSC's responsibility). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Post            Removal Procedure
1. Judge of the Supreme Court     :     Impeachment by Parliament
2. Comptroller and Auditor General:     Removal by the President
3. Governor of a State             :     Removal by the Prime Minister
4.  Speaker of Lok Sabha           :     Removal by the Rajya Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The removal procedure for Supreme Court judges is impeachment by Parliament, making option 1 correct.  The President removes the Comptroller and Auditor General, making option 2 correct.  The President, not the Prime Minister, removes a Governor. The Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, can remove the Speaker through a no-confidence motion. Therefore, only options 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                  Effect on the President's Powers
1. 42nd Constitutional Amendment :   Reduced the President's powers
2. 44th Constitutional Amendment :   Increased the President's powers
3. First Amendment Act             :    Clarified the President's powers concerning Fundamental Rights
4. Forty-First Amendment Act      :     Limited the President's powers regarding state governments.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act expanded the President's powers, particularly in relation to the declaration of emergencies. The 44th Amendment Act further limited the President's powers concerning the declaration of emergencies.  The First Amendment primarily dealt with clarifying the scope of Fundamental Rights, with minimal direct impact on presidential powers. The Forty-First Amendment related to the President's role in the event of a state government breakdown but didn't limit presidential powers in the broad sense. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 exhibit a reasonably accurate relationship between the act and its impact on presidential powers, although the effect on presidential powers in pair 3 is indirect and limited. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the relationship between the amendments and the President's powers.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                Location
1. Supreme Court                    :    Mumbai
2. High Court of Calcutta           :    Kolkata
3. Central Vigilance Commission    :    Chennai
4. Union Public Service Commission  :    Delhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court is located in Delhi, not Mumbai. The High Court of Calcutta is indeed located in Kolkata, making option 2 correct. The Central Vigilance Commission's headquarters are in Delhi, not Chennai. The UPSC's headquarters are in Delhi, making option 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Organization           Annual Report Publication
1. Central Vigilance Commission     :    2018
2. Union Public Service Commission :    2019
3. Election Commission of India     :    2020
4.  Finance Commission               :    2021

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four organizations publish annual reports, but the years mentioned are arbitrary and not necessarily the years in which those specific reports were published.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect because they wrongly assume the accuracy of the year pairings.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee on Panchayati Raj     Recommendation
1. Ashok Mehta Committee           :   Three-tier panchayati raj system
2. Balwantray Mehta Committee      :   Two-tier panchayati raj system
3. G.V.K. Rao Committee           :   One-tier panchayati raj system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ashok Mehta Committee recommended a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj. The Balwantray Mehta Committee recommended a three-tier system,  not a two-tier system. The GVK Rao Committee focused on administrative reforms in rural development and didn't specifically propose a particular tier structure for Panchayati Raj.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched, although with a slight inaccuracy in the Balwantray Mehta Committee's recommendation. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article      Subject Matter
1. Article 21                   :    Right to privacy
2. Article 23                   :    Prohibition of trafficking in human beings
3. Article 25                   :    Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion
4. Article 16                   :    Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment
5. Article 32                   :     Right to Constitutional Remedies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 21, while encompassing the right to life, has been interpreted to include the right to privacy by the Supreme Court.  Article 23 prohibits trafficking and forced labour. Article 25 deals with religious freedom. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in public employment. Article 32 grants the right to constitutional remedies.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched, albeit with a nuanced interpretation of Article 21.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article      Power/Function
1. Article 154                  :   Defines the executive power of the state
2. Article 161                  :   Grants the Governor pardoning power
3. Article 213                  :   Grants the Governor ordinance-making power
4. Article 356                  :   Deals with the imposition of President's Rule in a state


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 154 vests the executive power of the state in the Governor.  Article 161 provides the Governor with pardoning powers.  Article 213 deals with the Governor's power to issue ordinances. Article 356 outlines the procedure for imposing President's Rule in a state.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Appointing Authority
1. Comptroller and Auditor General of India : Lok Sabha Speaker
2. State Public Service Commission         : President of India
3. National Human Rights Commission      : Prime Minister of India
4. Delimitation Commission                : Election Commission of India
5. State Election Commission              : Governor of the respective state

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The State Public Service Commission is appointed by the Governor of the respective state.  The President of India plays no role in their appointment. This makes option 2 incorrect.  The Governor appoints the Chairperson and members of the State Public Service Commission. This makes option 2 correct. The State Election Commission is appointed by the Governor of the respective state, making option 5 correct. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India is appointed by the President, not the Lok Sabha Speaker (option 1 is incorrect). The National Human Rights Commission's Chairperson and members are appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister (option 3 is incorrect). The Delimitation Commission is appointed by the President, not the Election Commission of India (option 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution              Subject Matter
1. Article 310                               : Tenure of office of the Prime Minister
2. Article 148                              :  Powers and functions of the Election Commission
3. Article 326                              : Adult Suffrage
4. Article 153                              :  Appointment of the Governor
5. Article 266                              : Consolidated Fund of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 326 of the Indian Constitution deals with the electorate based on adult suffrage, making pair 3 correct. Article 266 deals with the Consolidated Fund of India, making pair 5 correct.  Article 310 deals with the tenure of civil servants, including all-India services and not the Prime Minister (pair 1 is incorrect). Article 148 deals with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, not the Election Commission (pair 2 is incorrect).  Article 153 deals with the Governor, but it doesn't specify the *appointment* process (pair 4 is incorrect; the appointment is done by the President). Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                  Area of Study
1. Vohra Committee                         : Police Reform
2. Sarkaria Commission                      : Centre-State relations
3. Nanavati Commission                      :  2002 Gujarat riots
4. Punchhi Commission                      :  Centre-State relations
5. Second Administrative Reforms Commission: Electoral reforms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Nanavati Commission was indeed set up to investigate the 2002 Gujarat riots, making pair 3 correct.  The Vohra Committee focused on the nexus between politicians and criminals, not police reform (pair 1 is incorrect). The Sarkaria Commission and Punchhi Commission both dealt with Centre-State relations, but the question asks for specific committee-area pairings, and thus these are not uniquely matched (pairs 2 and 4 are incorrect). The Second Administrative Reforms Commission focused on various aspects of governance, but not specifically electoral reforms (pair 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Organization             Primary Function
1. Union Public Service Commission     :  Conducts recruitment for state services
2. State Public Service Commission     :  Conducts recruitment for central services
3. Comptroller and Auditor General of India: Audits accounts of the Union and States
4. Election Commission of India         : Delimits parliamentary and assembly constituencies
5. Delimitation Commission             :  Oversees the conduct of elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) audits the accounts of both the Union and the states, making pair 3 correct. The UPSC conducts recruitment for central services, not state services (pair 1 is incorrect). State PSCs conduct recruitment for state services, not central services (pair 2 is incorrect). The Election Commission of India conducts elections, while the Delimitation Commission is responsible for constituency delimitation (pairs 4 and 5 are incorrect).  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                 Provision
1. Article 148                              :  Establishes the Election Commission
2. Article 149                              :  Establishes the Union Public Service Commission
3. Article 324                              :  Establishes the Comptroller and Auditor General
4. Article 326                              :  Enshrines adult franchise
5. Article 310                              :  Defines the Doctrine of Pleasure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 and 5 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 326 of the Indian Constitution guarantees adult franchise, making pair 4 correct. Article 310 relates to the Doctrine of Pleasure, which governs the tenure of certain government officials, making pair 5 correct. Article 148 establishes the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), not the Election Commission (pair 1 is incorrect). Article 149 defines the duties and powers of the CAG, not establishing the UPSC (pair 2 is incorrect). Article 324 deals with the Election Commission, not the CAG (pair 3 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                     Recommendation
1. Balwantray Mehta Committee Report       : Three-tier Panchayati Raj system
2. Ashok Mehta Committee Report            :  Two-tier Panchayati Raj system
3. G.V.K. Rao Committee Report            :  Strengthening existing rural development programs
4. L.M. Singhvi Committee Report          :  Constitutional status for Gram Sabhas
5. Second Administrative Reforms Commission Report:  Electoral reforms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Balwantray Mehta Committee recommended a three-tier Panchayati Raj system (pair 1 is correct). The Ashok Mehta Committee advocated for a two-tier Panchayati Raj system (pair 2 is correct). The G.V.K. Rao Committee focused on improving the existing administrative setup for rural development and poverty alleviation, not strengthening programs as stated (pair 3 is incorrect).  The L.M. Singhvi Committee did not specifically recommend constitutional status for Gram Sabhas (pair 4 is incorrect). The Second Administrative Reforms Commission's report covered many areas, but not specifically electoral reforms in the context of Panchayati Raj (pair 5 is incorrect).  Therefore only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Individual/Body                          Report Submitted To
1. Comptroller and Auditor General of India:  Parliament
2. State Public Service Commission         : Governor
3. Finance Commission                      : President
4. Election Commission of India             : Parliament
5. Governor of a state                      : President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India submits its reports to the Parliament, making pair 1 correct. The State Public Service Commission reports to the Governor of the respective state, making pair 2 correct. The Governor of a state reports to the President, making pair 5 correct. The Finance Commission submits its report to the President, not the Parliament (pair 3 is incorrect). The Election Commission does not directly report to the Parliament. It reports to the President (pair 4 is incorrect). Therefore, only pairs 1, 2 and 5 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body                    Composition/Appointment
1.  Union Public Service Commission      :  Appointed by the Prime Minister
2.  State Public Service Commission       :  Appointed by the Governor
3.  Finance Commission                    :  Appointed by the Election Commission
4.  Election Commission of India          :  Appointed by the President
5. Delimitation Commission               :  Appointed by the Lok Sabha Speaker


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The State Public Service Commission is appointed by the Governor, making pair 2 correct. The Election Commission of India is appointed by the President, making pair 4 correct.  The UPSC is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister (pair 1 is incorrect). The Finance Commission is appointed by the President, not the Election Commission (pair 3 is incorrect). The Delimitation Commission is also appointed by the President, not the Lok Sabha Speaker (pair 5 is incorrect). Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                     Accountability/Reporting
1.  Chief Minister                      :  Governor
2.  Council of Ministers (State)        :  State Legislative Assembly
3.  Comptroller and Auditor General of India:  President
4.  Union Council of Ministers         :  Parliament
5.  Governor of a state                  :  President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 4 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

A Chief Minister holds office during the pleasure of the Governor, making pair 1 correct. The Union Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Parliament, making pair 4 correct.  The Governor of a state holds office during the pleasure of the President, making pair 5 correct. The Council of Ministers at the state level is accountable to the State Legislative Assembly, not directly to the President (pair 2 is incorrect). The CAG reports to the Parliament, not the President (pair 3 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Article                        Subject Governed
1.  Article 161                         :  Powers of the President related to pardons
2.  Article 72                          :  Powers of the Governor related to pardons
3.  Article 154                         :  Executive power of the state
4.  Article 310                         :  Tenure of office of Ministers
5.  Article 356                         :  President's rule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 154 deals with the executive power of the state, making pair 3 correct. Article 356 deals with President's rule, making pair 5 correct. Article 72 outlines the President's power of pardon, not the Governor's (pair 2 is incorrect).  Article 161 deals with the Governor's pardoning power, not the President's (pair 1 is incorrect). Article 310 deals with the tenure of civil servants, not Ministers (pair 4 is incorrect). Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Defining Article
1. Union Public Service Commission          : Article 315
2. Comptroller and Auditor General of India : Article 148
3. Election Commission of India            : Article 324
4. Finance Commission                     : Article 280

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 148 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), outlining its establishment, powers, and functions.  Article 324 establishes the Election Commission of India, responsible for conducting elections to Parliament and State Legislatures. Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission, which advises the President on the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States.  However, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is defined under Article 315, not Article 316 as suggested in a distractor.  Article 316 deals with the appointment of UPSC members, not the establishment of the commission itself. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of incorrect articles as distractors, such as pairing the UPSC with Article 316, tests the candidate's precise knowledge of constitutional provisions and their ability to distinguish between closely related but distinct articles.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governmental Official                Appointment Authority
1. Governor of a State                     :  State Legislative Assembly
2. Chief Justice of India                  :  President of India
3. Comptroller and Auditor General of India :  President of India
4. Attorney General of India              :  Prime Minister of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).  The Governor of a state is appointed by the President, not elected by the State Legislative Assembly. The Attorney General is also appointed by the President, on the advice of the Prime Minister.  Option (b) correctly identifies the appointment authorities for the CJI and CAG.  The incorrect pairings act as effective distractors, particularly the Governor's appointment, testing the candidate's knowledge of the precise process of appointing key constitutional figures.  The inclusion of the Attorney General, who is appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister but by the President, further complicates the question, demanding a deep understanding of the Indian constitutional framework.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body                   Primary Function
1. National Human Rights Commission     :  Punishing human rights violators
2. Finance Commission                    :  Distribution of financial resources
3. Comptroller and Auditor General of India:  Auditing government accounts
4. Election Commission                   :  Conducting elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission's primary role is advising on the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States.  The CAG audits government accounts, ensuring financial accountability. The Election Commission conducts elections.  However, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) does not punish human rights violators; its role is primarily recommendatory. The NHRC investigates allegations, makes recommendations, and reports to the government.  It lacks the power to impose punishments or directly provide relief.  The inclusion of the NHRC with a misleading function serves as a strong distractor, requiring candidates to possess a nuanced understanding of its powers and limitations within the Indian constitutional system. This question assesses both factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG):**

1. The CAG is appointed by the President of India.
2. The CAG submits audit reports to the President and the Parliament.
3. The CAG has the power to initiate criminal proceedings against individuals found guilty of financial irregularities.
4. The CAG's salary and allowances are determined by the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the CAG (Statement 1 is correct). The CAG submits audit reports to the President and Parliament (Statement 2 is correct).  However, the CAG does *not* have the power to initiate criminal proceedings; it can only submit its findings and recommendations to the appropriate authorities who then decide on further action (Statement 3 is incorrect). The Parliament determines the CAG's salary and allowances (Statement 4 is correct).  Option (b) accurately reflects the correct statements.  The incorrect statement about the CAG's power to initiate criminal proceedings acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the CAG's role and limitations within the Indian legal and constitutional framework. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the CAG's powers and limitations.


**5. With reference to the President of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Power/Function                                   Related Constitutional Article
1. Appointment of Governors of States                 : Article 153
2.  Granting pardon in cases of death sentence      : Article 72
3.  Dissolution of Lok Sabha                         : Article 85
4.  Appointment of the Prime Minister                : Article 75

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 153 deals with the appointment of Governors by the President. Article 72 grants the President the power to grant pardons, including in cases of death sentences.  Article 75 deals with the appointment of the Prime Minister.  However, the President dissolves the Lok Sabha under Article 85, not Article 87 as suggested in a distractor. Article 87 relates to the address by the President to Parliament, not the dissolution of the lower house. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The inclusion of inaccurate articles as distractors tests the candidate's ability to recall specific constitutional provisions linked to the President's powers.  This question primarily assesses factual recall and the ability to match powers with the correct constitutional articles.



**6. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following pairs:**

   Power/Function                                     Source of Power
1.  Dissolving the State Legislative Assembly          :  Constitution of India, Article 174
2.  Appointing the Chief Minister                     :  Constitution of India, Article 164
3.  Recommending President's Rule to the President    :  Constitution of India, Article 356
4.  Granting pardons for offences against State laws :  Constitution of India, Article 161


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Governor’s power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly is derived from Article 174 of the Constitution.  Article 164 empowers the Governor to appoint the Chief Minister. Article 356 allows the Governor to recommend President's Rule to the President. Article 161 grants the Governor the power to pardon offences against state laws. All four pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate’s detailed understanding of the Governor’s powers and their constitutional basis. The question’s difficulty stems from requiring accurate recall of the specific articles related to each power of the Governor.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Commission/Body                                 Head/Chairperson Appointment Authority
1. Union Public Service Commission                 : Chairperson                  : President
2. National Human Rights Commission              : Chairperson                  : President
3. State Human Rights Commission                  : Chairperson                  : Governor
4. Finance Commission                             : Chairperson                  : Prime Minister

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the Chairpersons of the Union Public Service Commission and the National Human Rights Commission. The Governor appoints the Chairperson of the State Human Rights Commission.  However, the Chairperson of the Finance Commission is not appointed by the Prime Minister; while the Prime Minister heads the committee that recommends the appointment, the President makes the actual appointment.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The inclusion of the Finance Commission with an almost-correct but ultimately inaccurate appointment authority serves as a strong distractor, requiring candidates to carefully analyze the nuances of the appointment process for different constitutional bodies.  This question evaluates the candidate's knowledge of the appointment processes for various constitutional bodies, testing both factual recall and analytical skills.


**8. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following pairs:**

    Ex-Officio Member                                   Organization
1. Chairperson, National Commission for Scheduled Castes: Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
2. Chairperson, National Commission for Women       : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. Chairperson, National Commission for Minorities   : Ministry of Minority Affairs
4. Chairperson, National Commission for Backward Classes : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Women falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The National Commission for Minorities is under the Ministry of Minority Affairs. The National Commission for Backward Classes falls under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  However, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes is also under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not a separate ministry as suggested in the distractor. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of an almost-correct but ultimately incorrect ministry pairing acts as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the organizational structure of various governmental commissions and their respective ministries. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the administrative structure of Indian government bodies.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article          Subject Matter
1. Article 148                     :  Election Commission
2. Article 324                     :  Finance Commission
3. Article 280                     :  Comptroller and Auditor General
4. Article 315                     :  Union Public Service Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 315 deals with the Union Public Service Commission. Article 148 correctly defines the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.  Article 324 establishes the Election Commission. Article 280 correctly defines the Finance Commission. This question tests the examinee's knowledge of the specific articles that define various constitutional bodies. The incorrect pairings are designed to be plausible distractors, requiring careful attention to detail. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to link constitutional articles with their respective subjects.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

      Body/Commission                      Reporting Authority
1.  Union Public Service Commission       :  Parliament
2.  State Public Service Commission      :  Governor
3.  Comptroller and Auditor General of India:  President
4.  Finance Commission                    :  President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) submits its reports to the President of India. The Finance Commission submits its reports to the President. The UPSC submits reports to the President, not directly to Parliament, although Parliament scrutinizes its reports.  The State Public Service Commission reports to the Governor. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The incorrect pairings act as strong distractors, requiring careful understanding of the reporting structures of different constitutional bodies. This question tests the examinee's knowledge of the reporting structures of different constitutional bodies, requiring accurate recall of factual information.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commission                                       Established Under
1. National Commission for Scheduled Castes     :   Article 338A
2. National Commission for Scheduled Tribes      :   Article 338
3. National Commission for Backward Classes      :   The 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018
4. National Human Rights Commission             :   Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) was established under Article 338 of the Constitution of India, which was later amended by the 89th Amendment Act of 2003.  The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) was established under Article 338A of the Constitution, added by the 89th Amendment Act of 2003. The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) gained constitutional status through the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 2018.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a statutory body established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not a constitutional body. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because the NCSC is established under Article 338, not 338A. Option (b) is incorrect because the NCST is established under Article 338A, not Article 338. Option (d) is incorrect because while the NHRC is correctly matched, the NCSC's establishing article is incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                    Effect on Commissions
1. 89th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003    :   Established the National Commission for Backward Classes
2. 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018   :   Granted constitutional status to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes
3. Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993       :   Established the National Human Rights Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 89th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2003 established the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, not the National Commission for Backward Classes. The 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 2018 granted constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes, not the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, correctly established the National Human Rights Commission.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 338 originally established the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.  Article 338A, added later, established the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. Article 338B establishes the National Commission for Backward Classes.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they misrepresent the articles related to the commissions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Option (d) is incorrect because at least one pair is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Primary Concern
1. National Commission for Women                :   Scheduled Castes

The National Commission for Backward Classes deals with the welfare and rights of Backward Classes. Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly pair organizations with their areas of concern.


**5. With reference to the establishment of various commissions, consider the following pairs:**

   Commission                                    Establishing Act/Amendment

The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes was established by the 89th Constitutional Amendment Act, not the 102nd. The National Commission for Backward Classes received constitutional status through the 102nd Amendment, not the 89th.  The National Human Rights Commission was correctly established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings of commissions and their establishing legislation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Constitution of India and its relationship with other laws and institutions.  Each question follows the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                              Year of Enactment
1. Indian Treasure and Trove Act                :   1879

4. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act : 1952
5. Antiquities and Art Treasure Act              :   1973
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall regarding the enactment years of significant Indian laws related to cultural heritage and antiquities.  All the provided years are incorrect.  The correct enactment years are as follows:

1. **Indian Treasure and Trove Act:** 1878
2. **Ancient Monuments Preservation Act:** 1904
3. **The Antiquities (Export Control) Act:** 1947
4. **The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act:** 1951
5. **Antiquities and Art Treasure Act:** 1972

The question includes plausible distractors—years close to the actual enactment years—to increase the difficulty level.  Option (d) is correct because none of the provided pairs are correctly matched.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of specific historical details.


**2. With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                     Subject Matter
1. Article 370                               :   Special status for Jammu & Kashmir (now repealed)
2. Article 324                               :   Election Commission of India
3. Article 291                               :   Power of the State to borrow
4. Article 83                                :   Composition of the Council of States
5. Eighth Schedule                           :   Recognition of Classical Languages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's understanding of the subject matter covered by various articles of the Indian Constitution and its schedules.  Option (b) is the correct answer because:

* **Article 370** (now repealed) did deal with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.
* **Article 324** pertains to the Election Commission of India.
* **Eighth Schedule** lists the recognized languages of India, which includes Classical Languages.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

* **Article 291** deals with the power of the State to borrow, not the subject matter presented in the pair.  State government loan consent is mandated by the Constitution, but not defined in Article 291.
* **Article 83** deals with the composition of the Lok Sabha (House of the People), not the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).

The question is designed to be challenging by including plausible but incorrect pairings and a comprehensive list of options. This assesses the candidate's ability to recall and differentiate between specific constitutional provisions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                         Power/Function
1. Union Cabinet                             :   Appoints the Chief Election Commissioner
2. Parliament                               :   Establishes NITI Aayog
3. President of India                        :   Constitutes the Finance Commission
4. High Courts                               :   Defined in the Constitution of India
5. Lok Sabha                                 :   Solely responsible for passing the Union Budget


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

This question assesses conceptual understanding and factual recall regarding the roles and powers of various Indian governmental bodies. Option (c) is correct because:

* The **Union Cabinet** advises the President on the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner.
* The **President of India** appoints the members of the Finance Commission.
* **High Courts** are established and their structure is detailed within the Constitution of India.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because:

* While Parliament has the power to legislate, the **Union Cabinet** is the body that establishes new organizations like NITI Aayog.
* The Union Budget requires the approval of both houses of Parliament, it is not solely the responsibility of the **Lok Sabha**.

The question differentiates between the roles of different bodies in the Indian government, making it challenging by including distractors that play on overlapping responsibilities. This tests the candidate's ability to analyze and distinguish between the functions of different branches of government.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Language                                    Schedule/Article
1. Hindi                                       :   Eighth Schedule
2. Sanskrit                                    :   Eighth Schedule
3. English                                     :   Article 343(1)
4. Official Languages of States               :  Article 345
5. Twenty-two languages recognized            :   Eighth Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Constitution's provisions regarding language.  All the pairs are correctly matched:

1. Hindi is listed in the Eighth Schedule.
2. Sanskrit is listed in the Eighth Schedule.
3. Article 343(1) deals with the official language of the Union.  While Hindi is the official language, English also holds a significant position.
4. Article 345 deals with the official language of states.
5. The Eighth Schedule lists 22 languages.


All options other than (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs. The question assesses factual recall of constitutional provisions related to language policy in India.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes the question deceptively easy unless the candidate has memorized the details.


**5. With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act           Provision Amended/Added
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992:   Added Part IX-A (Panchayats)
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992:   Added Part IX-B (Municipalities)
3. 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002:    Right to Education
4. 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016:  Goods and Services Tax (GST)
5. 58th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1987:   Lowering the voting age to 18


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant Constitutional Amendment Acts and their impact.  All the pairs are correctly matched.

1. The 73rd Amendment added Part IX-A, dealing with Panchayati Raj institutions.
2. The 74th Amendment added Part IX-B, dealing with Municipalities.
3. The 86th Amendment added the Right to Education as a Fundamental Right.
4. The 101st Amendment introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
5. The 61st Amendment Act of 1989 lowered the voting age to 18 years.  The 58th amendment is a distractor.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs. The question assesses the candidate's ability to link constitutional amendments with specific legal provisions.  The difficulty lies in the comprehensive nature of the correct answer, requiring thorough knowledge of several amendments.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act             Year of Enactment
1.  First Constitutional Amendment Act     :   1952
2.  Forty-Second Constitutional Amendment Act :  1976
3.  Fifty-eighth Constitutional Amendment Act :  1987
4. Seventy-third Constitutional Amendment Act: 1993
5. Seventy-fourth Constitutional Amendment Act: 1992

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The First Constitutional Amendment Act was enacted in 1951, not 1952.  The Forty-Second Amendment Act was indeed enacted in 1976, significantly altering the Preamble by adding "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity." The Fifty-eighth Amendment Act, enacted in 1987, lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. The Seventy-third Amendment Act, related to Panchayati Raj Institutions, was enacted in 1992, not 1993, while the Seventy-fourth Amendment Act, concerning Municipalities, was enacted in 1992.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  Option (a) correctly identifies only the pairs related to the 42nd and 58th Amendment Acts, which are accurately matched with their years of enactment.  This question tests factual recall of significant constitutional amendments and their timelines, crucial knowledge for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution              Subject Matter
1. Article 29                               :  Protection of interests of minorities
2. Article 324                               :  Election Commission
3. Article 370                               :  Special status of Jammu and Kashmir
4.  Article 39A                              :  Equal justice and free legal aid
5. Articles 82 and 170                      :  Delimitation of constituencies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

Article 29 of the Constitution of India explicitly safeguards the interests of minorities based on language or culture.  Article 324 deals with the Election Commission of India and its powers and functions. Article 370, prior to its revocation, granted special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.  Article 39A is directly related to ensuring equal justice and providing free legal aid to the underprivileged. Articles 82 and 170 deal with the allocation of seats in Parliament and State Legislatures, respectively, and the procedures for delimitation of constituencies.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of specific articles and their associated subjects, a critical aspect of Indian Polity preparation for the UPSC exam.  The inclusion of multiple articles ensures a comprehensive assessment of the candidate's knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                    Key Provision
1.  Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878   :   Regulation of treasure trove discovery
2.  Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904:  Protection of ancient monuments
3.  Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947 :  Control over export of antiques
4.  Public Records Act, 1993              :   Management of public records
5.  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972:  Protection of cultural heritage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Each of the acts listed is correctly paired with its primary focus. The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878, deals with the legal aspects of discovering and claiming treasure troves. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, focuses on safeguarding ancient monuments and archaeological sites. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947, regulates the export of antiques to prevent the illegal outflow of India's cultural heritage. The Public Records Act, 1993, aims at the proper management and preservation of public records. The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of antiquities and art treasures.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of specific Indian laws related to cultural heritage and governance. The question's difficulty stems from the number of acts and the need for precise knowledge of each act's purpose.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                      Defined in the Constitution of India?
1.  High Courts                           :   Yes
2.  NITI Aayog                            :   No
3.  Finance Commission                   :   Yes
4.  State Election Commissions            :   Yes
5.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):  Yes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

High Courts, Finance Commissions, State Election Commissions, and the UPSC are all explicitly mentioned and defined within the Constitution of India.  Their establishment, powers, and functions are detailed in various articles.  However, NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a post-constitutional body, established by a resolution of the Union Cabinet, replacing the Planning Commission.  Therefore, only the pairs concerning High Courts, Finance Commission, State Election Commissions, and UPSC are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of constitutional bodies and their origins, a critical element in understanding the Indian governmental structure.  The inclusion of NITI Aayog as a distractor increases the question's difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Language                       Mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution?
1.  Hindi                            :   Yes
2.  Sanskrit                         :   Yes
3.  Kannada                          :   Yes
4.  Konkani                           :   Yes
5.  Sindhi                            :   Yes
6.  Bhojpuri                          :   No
7.  Marathi                           :   Yes
8.  Tamil                             :   Yes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 only
(b) All eight
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 only

**Explanation:**

The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages recognized by the Constitution.  Hindi, Sanskrit, Kannada, Konkani, Sindhi, Marathi, and Tamil are all included in this list. However, Bhojpuri is not currently included in the Eighth Schedule, although it is a widely spoken language in India.  Therefore, only the seven pairs (excluding Bhojpuri) are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall of the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution, demonstrating knowledge of linguistic diversity and constitutional provisions in India. The inclusion of Bhojpuri as a distractor increases the complexity of the question.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                 Role related to the Constitution of India
1.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar                    :   Chairman of the Drafting Committee
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru                      :   Moved the Objectives Resolution
3.  Rajendra Prasad                       :   First President of India
4.  Prem Behari Narain Raizada            :   Calligrapher of the Preamble
5.  Nand Lal Bose                         :   Illuminated the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, as the chairman of the Drafting Committee, played a pivotal role in drafting the Constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru presented the Objectives Resolution, which greatly influenced the Constitution's framing. Rajendra Prasad served as the first President of India after the Constitution's adoption. Prem Behari Narain Raizada was responsible for the calligraphy of the Preamble, and Nand Lal Bose illuminated the original copies of the Constitution. Thus, all five pairs are correctly matched.  This question assesses the knowledge of key figures involved in the Constitution-making process and their specific contributions, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the historical context of the Constitution.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**


   Date                                   Event related to the Constitution of India

(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India was adopted on November 26, 1949, by the Constituent Assembly. It came into force on January 26, 1950.  The Constituent Assembly held its first meeting on December 9, 1946.  Elections to the Constituent Assembly were held in July-August 1946. The final meeting of the Constituent Assembly took place on January 24, 1950.  All five pairs accurately reflect significant dates and events in the history of the Indian Constitution. This question tests the understanding of the chronology of events leading to the creation and implementation of the Indian Constitution, a key area for UPSC preparation.  The inclusion of multiple dates and events increases the question's difficulty.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Constitution of India and related aspects.  Each question adheres to the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 32 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, providing citizens with the ability to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. Part IV-A deals with Fundamental Duties, outlining the moral obligations of citizens towards the nation. Article 370, although now inoperative, historically granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The Eighth Schedule lists the official languages recognized by the Indian Constitution.  Finally, Part III of the Constitution comprehensively covers Fundamental Rights, outlining the basic human rights guaranteed to all citizens.  There is no mismatch in any of the given pairs.

(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a significant constitutional amendment and its impact. The 42nd Amendment significantly altered the Preamble's wording. The 44th Amendment removed the Right to Property as a fundamental right, transforming it into a legal right. The 73rd and 74th Amendments introduced the three-tier Panchayati Raj system and urban local government structures, respectively.  The First Amendment Act added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, allowing for the protection of certain laws from judicial review.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body            Function
1. Election Commission of India   :  Conducts elections to Parliament and State Legislatures
2. Finance Commission             :  Recommends the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States
3. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) :  Audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments
4. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :  Conducts civil service examinations
5. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):  Investigates human rights violations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately depict the constitutional bodies and their primary functions. The Election Commission is responsible for conducting free and fair elections. The Finance Commission addresses the crucial financial distribution between the Union and States. The CAG ensures the accountability of government spending. The UPSC plays a vital role in recruiting civil servants.  The NHRC investigates human rights violations. Thus, all the given pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                Description
1.  Federalism                  :  A system of government with a strong central government and weak state governments.
2.  Secularism                   :  The principle of separation of religion from the state.
3.  Judicial Review              :  The power of the judiciary to review the constitutionality of laws.
4.  Emergency Provisions         :  Mechanisms to deal with threats to national security.
5.  Directive Principles of State Policy :  Non-justiciable guidelines for the state to promote social and economic welfare.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

While options 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, the description of federalism in option 1 is inaccurate. The Indian federal system is characterized by a balance of power between the central and state governments,  not necessarily a strong center and weak states.  Secularism is correctly defined in option 2.  Judicial review, emergency provisions, and Directive Principles are also accurately described in options 3, 4, and 5, respectively.  Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Castes/Tribes    State/Union Territory
1.  Santhals                   :   Jharkhand
2.  Bhils                      :   Rajasthan
3.  Gonds                      :   Madhya Pradesh
4.  Toda                       :   Tamil Nadu
5.  Lepchas                    :   Sikkim


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately link Scheduled Castes/Tribes with their prominent presence in the respective states/union territories.  Santhals are a significant tribal group in Jharkhand. Bhils are found predominantly in Rajasthan. Gonds are a large tribal population in Madhya Pradesh. The Toda tribe is native to the Nilgiri hills of Tamil Nadu.  Lepchas are an indigenous group in Sikkim.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched.  The question effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of various Scheduled Tribes in India.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article/Schedule          Related Legal Concept/Act
1. Article 324                               :  Election Commission of India
2. Eighth Schedule                         :  Official Languages of India
3. Fifth Schedule                            :  Administration of Scheduled Areas
4.  Tenth Schedule                           :  Anti-Defection Law
5. Part III                                  :   Fundamental Rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 324 of the Constitution of India deals with the Election Commission of India, its composition, powers, and functions.  The Eighth Schedule lists the official languages recognized by the Indian Constitution. The Fifth Schedule outlines provisions for the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and the welfare of Scheduled Tribes residing in those areas. The Tenth Schedule, added through the 52nd Amendment Act, 1985, is commonly known as the Anti-Defection Law, which addresses the issue of legislators changing parties. Finally, Part III of the Constitution is dedicated to Fundamental Rights, which are guaranteed to Indian citizens.  Each pair directly links a specific constitutional provision with its corresponding legal concept or act, demonstrating a precise understanding of the Indian Constitution's structure and content. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                    Provision/Impact
1. 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976         :  Added "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble
2. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992         :  Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992         :  Established Urban Local Bodies
4. 52nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1985         :  Added the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law)
5. 44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978         :  Removed Right to Property as a Fundamental Right


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a significant constitutional amendment and its resulting impact on the Indian legal and political landscape. The 42nd Amendment significantly altered the Preamble, adding "Socialist" and "Secular" to describe the Indian state. The 73rd and 74th Amendments established the three-tier Panchayati Raj system and urban local bodies, respectively, marking a crucial step towards decentralization. The 52nd Amendment introduced the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law) to curb political defections.  The 44th Amendment removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights, transforming it into a legal right under Article 300A.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Legal Document Section/Part                 Content/Concept
1. Preamble                                    :  Establishes a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic
2. Part III                                    :  Fundamental Rights
3. Part IV                                    :  Directive Principles of State Policy
4. Part IV-A                                  : Fundamental Duties
5. Appendices I-V                               :  Detailed Articles and Schedules


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question tests the knowledge of the basic structure and content of the Indian Constitution. The Preamble concisely outlines the nature of the Indian state as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic. Part III explicitly details the Fundamental Rights of citizens. Part IV lists the Directive Principles of State Policy, guiding principles for the state. Part IV-A contains the Fundamental Duties of citizens.  Appendices I-V provide supplementary information, including the complete text of articles and schedules.  Therefore, all five pairs accurately reflect the content and organization of the Indian Constitution.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                             Associated Constitutional Provision
1.  Economic Justice                          :  Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV)
2.  Social Justice                            :  Preamble and Directive Principles of State Policy
3.  Liberty of Thought and Expression        :  Fundamental Rights (Article 19)
4.  Equality before the Law                  :  Fundamental Rights (Article 14)
5.  Anti-Defection Law                       :  Tenth Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately link legal concepts with their relevant constitutional provisions. Economic justice is a core principle within the Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV), aiming for equitable distribution of resources. Social justice, a broader concept, finds mention in both the Preamble and the Directive Principles.  Liberty of thought and expression is a Fundamental Right guaranteed under Article 19. Equality before the law, another Fundamental Right, is enshrined in Article 14. The anti-defection law is explicitly detailed in the Tenth Schedule. Thus, a complete understanding of the Indian Constitution's framework is necessary to answer correctly. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and hence incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Law                                       Basis in the Constitution of India
1. Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878      :  Implicitly through the Constitution's mandate to protect national heritage
2. Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904 :  Implicitly through the Constitution's mandate to protect national heritage
3. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947:  Implicitly through the Constitution's mandate to protect national heritage
4. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act, 1951: Implicitly through the Constitution's mandate to protect national heritage
5. Public Records Act, 1993                  :  Implicitly through the Constitution's mandate to protect national heritage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the Constitution of India doesn't explicitly mention these specific acts,  they are all implicitly based on the Constitution's overarching aim to protect and preserve India's cultural heritage. The Constitution's commitment to protecting Indian culture and its various aspects provides the underlying justification for the existence and enforcement of these laws.  Each act contributes to the preservation of India's historical and cultural assets. Therefore, the Constitution's implicit mandate forms the basis for all five laws. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the constitutional basis for all five laws.  The correct answer requires a nuanced understanding of the Constitution's implied powers and its commitment to cultural preservation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Event                                      Associated Figure/Entity
1. Third Round Table Conference                 :   Indian National Congress participation
2. Government of India Act, 1935              :   Establishment of Provincial Public Service Commission
3. Government of India Act, 1935              :    Joint electorates
4. Wavell Plan                                   :   Shimla Conference
5.  Government of India Act, 1935              :   Provincial autonomy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, was a landmark legislation that significantly reshaped the Indian political landscape.  The act established a system of provincial autonomy, granting significant self-governance powers to the provinces. This is reflected in the correct matching of pair 5. The Act also implemented a system of joint electorates, where members of different communities would vote together in the same electorate, a crucial aspect of the electoral process, correctly matching pair 3. Furthermore, the establishment of Provincial Public Service Commissions was a key administrative reform introduced by the 1935 Act, making pair 2 also correct.

Pair 1 is incorrect because the Indian National Congress did *not* participate in the Third Round Table Conference. While some individual Congress leaders attended, the party as a whole boycotted it due to disagreements with the British government's approach to constitutional reforms. Pair 4 is incorrectly matched as the Wavell Plan was directly associated with the Shimla Conference, but the conference itself wasn't a feature *of* the Wavell Plan; the Wavell Plan was the agenda for the conference.  The other options are incorrect because they include at least one of these incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                     Subject Matter
1. Article 371A                               :   Special provisions for Andhra Pradesh
2. Fifth Schedule                              :   Administration of Scheduled Areas in several states
3. Seventh Schedule                             :   Taxation demarcation (provincial and local)
4. Sixth Schedule                              :   Autonomous districts in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram
5. Article 371-I                               : Special provisions for Sikkim

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals specifically with the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in various states, except Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. This makes pair 2 a correct match.  The Sixth Schedule outlines the governance structure for tribal areas in the four northeastern states mentioned above; they are constituted as autonomous districts under this Schedule. Therefore, pair 4 is also correctly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect because Article 371A pertains to special provisions for Nagaland, not Andhra Pradesh.  Article 371D addresses special provisions for Andhra Pradesh. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Seventh Schedule deals with the Union, State, and Concurrent Lists of subjects on which the Union and State legislatures can make laws, not specifically with taxation demarcation at the provincial and local levels.  Though related, the division of powers regarding taxation is a broader subject covered in the Seventh Schedule. While the 1935 Act did impact taxation, the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution is the relevant constitutional provision for the distribution of powers. Pair 5 is incorrect because Article 371-I relates to special provisions for Goa, not Sikkim; Article 371F addresses special provisions for Sikkim.  Only options (a) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Plan                                      Provision/Feature
1. Government of India Act, 1935              :   Equal representation for Hindus and Muslims in the Executive Council
2. Wavell Plan                                   :   Proposed equal representation for Hindus and Muslims in the Executive Council
3. Government of India Act, 1935              :   Establishment of the Federal Public Service Commission
4. Government of India Act, 1935              :   Provided representation for depressed classes
5.  Indian Constitution                         :  Proposed an All-India Federation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Wavell Plan aimed to achieve a degree of power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims in the Executive Council by providing equal representation. This makes pair 2 correct.  The Government of India Act, 1935, established a Federal Public Service Commission to manage appointments to the federal services, making pair 3 correct. The Act also included provisions for representation of depressed classes, making pair 4 correct.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While the 1935 Act did establish a framework for governance, it did not explicitly mandate equal representation for Hindus and Muslims in the Executive Council; the Wavell Plan attempted to address this later.  Pair 5 is incorrect; the 1935 Act, not the Indian Constitution, proposed the All-India Federation. The Indian Constitution ultimately did not implement a fully realized All-India Federation due to the integration of Princely States being incomplete.  Option (a) is the only option that correctly identifies all the accurately matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment Act              Provision/Effect
1. 42nd Amendment                             :   Addition of "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble
2. 57th Amendment                             :   Special provisions for Nagaland
3. 371A                                    :   Special provisions for Sikkim
4. 371F                                    :   Special provisions for Goa
5. 371-I                                    :  Special provisions for Mizoram

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment to the Indian Constitution is famously known for adding the words "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble, reflecting a shift in the nation's ideological stance.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Pair 2 is incorrect; the 57th Amendment Act deals with special provisions for Sikkim and not Nagaland. The special provision for Nagaland is Article 371A. Pair 3 is incorrect; Article 371A is for Nagaland not Sikkim. Article 371F contains special provisions for Sikkim. Pair 4 is incorrect; Article 371-I relates to Goa not Sikkim. Article 371G deals with special provisions for Mizoram.  Pair 5 is incorrect; Article 371-I is for Goa, not Mizoram. Article 371G contains special provisions for Mizoram. Only option (b) accurately reflects the correct matching pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

     State                                    Special Constitutional Provision
1. Nagaland                                  :  Article 371-E
2. Assam                                     :  Article 371-B
3. Manipur                                   :  Article 371-C
4. Andhra Pradesh                             :  Article 371-D
5. Goa                                       :  Article 371-I

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution incorporates several Articles providing special provisions for various states, reflecting regional specificities and the need for tailored governance approaches.  Article 371A deals with special provisions for Nagaland, Article 371B for Assam, Article 371C for Manipur, Article 371D for Andhra Pradesh, and Article 371-I for Goa.  All the pairs are correctly matched; therefore, option (d) is correct.  There are no incorrect pairings in this question.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills, focusing on factual recall and analysis with plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                  Role related to Constituent Assembly
    1. Dr. Rajendra Prasad :  Vice-President of the Constituent Assembly
    2. V.T. Krishnamachari: Temporary President of the Constituent Assembly
    3. Dr. Sachchidananda Sinha:  President of the Constituent Assembly
    4. H.C. Mukherjee     :  Vice-President of the Constituent Assembly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Dr. Rajendra Prasad was indeed elected President of the Constituent Assembly.  Option 1 is correctly matched. H.C. Mukherjee served as one of the Vice-Presidents of the Constituent Assembly, making option 4 correct. Option 2 is incorrect; V.T. Krishnamachari was elected as a Vice-President, not the Temporary President. The Temporary President was Dr. Sachchidananda Sinha, which makes option 3 incorrect as well.  Understanding the different roles and the chronology of elections within the Constituent Assembly is crucial for correctly answering this question.  The distractors are carefully chosen to include plausible, but ultimately inaccurate, pairings of individuals and their roles.


**2. With reference to the Constituent Assembly, consider the following pairs:**

    Political Party           Representation in Constituent Assembly
    1. Muslim League          :  Dominated the Assembly
    2. Congress Party          :  Had a significant minority representation
    3. Scheduled Castes       :  Were significantly underrepresented
    4. Princely States          :  Initially lacked participation but later joined

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option 4 accurately reflects the historical reality of the Princely States' involvement in the Constituent Assembly.  Their initial reluctance to participate was a significant challenge, eventually overcome through negotiations.  Options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. While the Muslim League and Congress both had representation, neither dominated the assembly in the way option 1 suggests.  The Congress party held a substantial majority.  Scheduled Castes, while represented, were not significantly underrepresented as option 3 incorrectly states; they had reserved seats.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the complex power dynamics and representation within the Constituent Assembly.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Key Concept in the Preamble       Description
    1.  Liberty                         :  Assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.
    2.  Equality                       :  Justice, social, economic and political
    3.  Fraternity                     :  Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship
    4.  Justice                         :  Equality of status and of opportunity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d) None of the above

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  The definitions of the key concepts in the Preamble are deliberately jumbled to create challenging distractors.  The correct pairings are: Liberty – freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship; Equality – equality of status and opportunity; Fraternity – assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation; Justice – social, economic and political justice. This question tests the candidate's precise understanding of the Preamble's core values and their accurate definitions, highlighting the need for detailed knowledge rather than superficial understanding.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitution's framing, consider the following pairs:**

    Document                     Role in Constitution-making
    1. Cabinet Mission Plan       :  Final determination of the Constituent Assembly's composition
    2. Objectives Resolution      :  Provided the philosophical underpinning for the Preamble
    3. Government of India Act 1935: Directly influenced the federal structure of the Constitution
    4. Indian Independence Act 1947: Determined the initial strength of the Constituent Assembly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Objectives Resolution, moved by Jawaharlal Nehru, indeed provided the core ideological framework for the Preamble, making option 2 correct. The Government of India Act 1935 significantly shaped the federal features of the Indian Constitution, making option 3 correct.  Options 1 and 4 are incorrect. The Cabinet Mission Plan did influence the Constituent Assembly's formation, but it didn't make the *final* determination of its composition.  The Indian Independence Act 1947, while setting the stage for independence, didn’t determine the Constituent Assembly's initial strength; that was decided earlier. The question tests knowledge of the various documents and their roles in shaping the Indian Constitution.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article Number       Subject Matter in the Constitution
    1. Article 61          :  Removal of the Vice-President
    2. Article 94          :  Removal of the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
    3. Article 67(b)       :  Impeachment of the President
    4. Article 90          :  Removal of the Speaker of Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 61 correctly deals with the procedure for the impeachment of the President, making option 3 correct. Article 67(b) outlines the process for removing the Vice-President, making option 1 correct.  Options 2 and 4 are incorrect.  Article 94 pertains to the removal of judges, not the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Article 90 deals with the disqualification of members of the Rajya Sabha, not the removal of the Lok Sabha Speaker. This question tests detailed knowledge of specific articles within the Indian Constitution and their associated procedures.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates familiar with the general functions of these articles but not their precise content.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Schedule        Subject Matter
    1. Third Schedule                 : List of languages
    2. Fourth Schedule                : Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha
    3. Seventh Schedule               : Forms of oath or affirmations
    4. Eighth Schedule                : List of subjects for laws

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only option 2 is correctly matched; the Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  The other options are incorrect: The Third Schedule lists forms of oath or affirmation, the Seventh Schedule outlines the Union, State, and Concurrent lists, and the Eighth Schedule lists the recognized languages of India. The question tests knowledge of the various schedules of the Indian Constitution and their respective functions, using plausible but incorrect pairings as distractors.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Subject          Order of Appearance in the Constitution
    1. Citizenship                      :  Before Fundamental Rights
    2. Fundamental Duties              :  After Directive Principles of State Policy
    3. Directive Principles of State Policy: Before Citizenship
    4. The Union and its Territory     : After Fundamental Rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Only option 1 is correct. Citizenship is dealt with before Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution. The other options are incorrect: Fundamental Duties appear *after* Directive Principles, Directive Principles appear *before* Citizenship, and The Union and its territory are discussed before Fundamental Rights. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the sequential arrangement of subjects in the Indian Constitution. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's precise knowledge of the order of constitutional provisions.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision          Country of Origin (Primary Influence)
    1. Fundamental Rights            :  USA
    2. Directive Principles of State Policy: Ireland
    3. Emergency Powers              :  Germany
    4. Residual Powers of Centre      :  Australia

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Fundamental Rights provisions in the Indian Constitution draw significant inspiration from the US Constitution.  The Directive Principles of State Policy have their origins in the Irish Constitution.  The Emergency powers are largely based on the Weimar Constitution of Germany. The allocation of residuary powers to the Centre is influenced by the Australian Constitution. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the diverse sources of inspiration for the Indian Constitution.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Article Number           Provision
    1. Article 61              : Removal of the Vice President
    2. Article 67(b)           : Impeachment of the President
    3. Article 90              : Removal of the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
    4. Article 94              : Removal of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Article 61 correctly deals with the procedure for removing the President, and Article 67(b) correctly pertains to the impeachment of the President.  Options 3 and 4 are incorrect: Article 90 deals with the disqualification of Rajya Sabha members, and Article 94 concerns the removal of judges. This question demands precise knowledge of constitutional articles and their corresponding provisions.  The distractors utilize similar article numbers to those of the correct answers but relate to different subjects, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Constituent Assembly:**

    1. It was based on adult suffrage.
    2. It was a result of direct election.
    3. It was a multi-party body.
    4. It worked through various committees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The Constituent Assembly was a multi-party body, representing various political viewpoints and interests. It functioned effectively through a series of committees, which facilitated the drafting and discussion of the Constitution. Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect; the Assembly was not based on adult suffrage (universal adult franchise was not in place) and its members were indirectly elected through provincial assemblies.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the nature and functioning of the Constituent Assembly, using distractors that represent common misconceptions.


These ten questions provide a comprehensive yet challenging assessment of knowledge related to the Constituent Assembly and related constitutional aspects.  The distractors are carefully constructed to test the candidate’s deep understanding of the subject matter, going beyond simple memorization.

1. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Subject Matter
   1. Article 52                     :  Office of Vice-President
   2. Article 53                     :  Executive power of the Union
   3. Article 54                     :  Election of the President
   4. Article 61                     :  Procedure for impeachment of the President

   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
   (a) 1 only
   (b) 2 and 3 only
   (c) 3 and 4 only
   (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 52 of the Indian Constitution deals with the President of India, not the Vice-President.  The Vice-President is addressed in Article 66. Article 53 correctly establishes that the executive power of the Union is vested in the President. However, Article 52 defines the office of the President, not the executive power.  Article 54 accurately outlines the election of the President.  Crucially, Article 61 precisely details the procedure for the impeachment of the President. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options include incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of constitutional articles and their specific subject matter.  A comprehensive understanding of the Indian Constitution is crucial for success in the UPSC examination, demanding not just familiarity but also a deep grasp of individual articles and their functions within the broader framework of governance.


2. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Power or Function
   1. Article 72                      :  Pardon power of the Governor
   2. Article 74                      :  Council of Ministers to aid and advise the President
   3. Article 148                    :  Establishment of the Union Public Service Commission
   4. Article 280                    :  Appointment of the Election Commission

   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
   (a) 1 only
   (b) 2 and 3 only
   (c) 3 only
   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 72 correctly describes the President's power of pardon, not the Governor's. The Governor's pardoning power is defined in Article 161. Article 74 accurately states the role of the Council of Ministers in aiding and advising the President. Article 148 correctly pertains to the establishment of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).  Article 280, however, deals with the establishment of the Finance Commission, not the Election Commission which is established by law. The Election Commission of India's formation is not directly mandated by a specific constitutional article but established through legislation.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The incorrect pairings in options (a), (c), and (d) demonstrate the importance of precise knowledge of constitutional provisions for accurate matching. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the Indian Constitution's framework, essential for the UPSC exam.


3. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Position                                  Method of Removal
   1. President of India                     :  Impeachment by Parliament
   2. Judge of Supreme Court                :  Removal by the President
   3. Governor of a State                    :  Removal by the President
   4. Speaker of Lok Sabha                  :  No formal removal mechanism in the Constitution

   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
   (a) 1 and 2 only
   (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
   (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India can be removed through impeachment by Parliament (Article 61), making pair 1 correct. Judges of the Supreme Court can be removed by the President on an address by Parliament (Article 124), thus pair 2 is correct.  Governors of states are also removed by the President (Article 156), making pair 3 correct.  However, while the Speaker of Lok Sabha can be removed through a no-confidence motion, there isn't a specific constitutional provision for their removal. The Speaker's removal is a parliamentary process. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the removal processes of various constitutional office holders, a crucial aspect of Indian governance and a frequent theme in UPSC questions.  The distractors emphasize the need for precise knowledge, avoiding generalizations.


4. **With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Schedule                                 Subject Matter
   1. Second Schedule                         :  Oath of office for the President
   2. Third Schedule                          :  Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha
   3. Fourth Schedule                         :  Oath or affirmation by members of Parliament
   4. Fifth Schedule                          :  Administration of Scheduled Areas

   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
   (a) 1 only
   (b) 1 and 4 only
   (c) 3 and 4 only
   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Second Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with salaries and allowances of various dignitaries, including the President, making pair 1 correct. The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha, not the Third Schedule. The Third Schedule deals with oaths and affirmations. The Fifth Schedule correctly addresses the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes.  The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian Constitution's schedules and their contents, requiring precise factual recall. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


5. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                   Functions
   1. Comptroller and Auditor General of India  :  Auditing the accounts of the Union and States
   2. Union Public Service Commission      :   Conducting recruitment for state-level services
   3. Finance Commission                     :  Recommending principles governing the distribution of taxes
   4. National Human Rights Commission     :  Investigating human rights violations

   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
   (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
   (b) 1 and 3 only
   (c) 1 and 4 only
   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India audits the accounts of the Union and States, making pair 1 correct. The UPSC conducts recruitment primarily for All-India Services and certain other central services, not state-level services. State Public Service Commissions handle recruitment for state-level services. The Finance Commission recommends principles for the distribution of tax revenues between the Centre and the States, making pair 3 correct. The National Human Rights Commission investigates human rights violations at the national level. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the functions of key constitutional bodies.  The distractors highlight the importance of distinguishing between the roles and responsibilities of various organizations.


6. **With reference to the Indian Parliamentary System, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bill                              Legislative Procedure
    1. Money Bill                               :  Can be introduced only on the recommendation of the President
    2. Ordinary Bill                             :  Requires the assent of the President for enactment
    3. Constitutional Amendment Bill          :  Requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament
    4. Private Member's Bill                   :  Introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister


   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
   (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
   (b) 1, 3, and 4 only
   (c) 2 and 4 only
   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

A Money Bill, as per Article 110, can only be introduced in Parliament on the recommendation of the President.  Ordinary Bills require the President's assent for enactment (Article 111).  Constitutional Amendment Bills need a special majority in both Houses (Article 368). Private Member's Bills are introduced by MPs who are not ministers.  All four pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of different types of bills and their legislative procedures within the Indian Parliament. The inclusion of all correct pairs makes the question challenging, demanding comprehensive knowledge of parliamentary procedures.


7. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act         Key Provision
   1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act :  Establishment of Panchayats at the village, intermediate and district levels
   2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act :  Establishment of Municipalities at the three levels
   3. 91st Constitutional Amendment Act :  Reservation of seats for SCs and STs in proportion to their population
   4. 52nd Constitutional Amendment Act:  Addition of the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law)


   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
   (a) 1 and 2 only
   (b) 1, 2, and 4 only
   (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
   (d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act established the three-tier panchayati raj system. The 74th Amendment Act established the three-tier municipal system. The 52nd Amendment Act introduced the Tenth Schedule, dealing with anti-defection. However, the 91st Amendment Act does not directly deal with reservation of seats in the proportion to their population.  It deals with reservation of seats for SCs and STs in local bodies, but not necessarily in direct proportion to their population.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge about specific Constitutional Amendment Acts and their key features, requiring precise factual recall and understanding of the nuances of legislative changes.


8. **Consider the following pairs:**

    Article                                  Power or Function
    1. Article 352                               :  Proclamation of Financial Emergency
    2. Article 356                               :  Proclamation of President's Rule in a State
    3. Article 360                               :  Proclamation of National Emergency
    4. Article 365                               :  Failure of a State to comply with the directions of the Union

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 2 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency, not a Financial Emergency. Article 356 correctly relates to the President's Rule in a state. Article 360 correctly defines the Financial Emergency. Article 365 accurately describes the consequences of a state's failure to comply with Union directives. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution, a critical area for UPSC aspirants. The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


9. **With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Article                                         Provision
    1. Article 32                                    :  Right to Constitutional Remedies
    2. Article 370                                   :  Special status for Jammu and Kashmir (now repealed)
    3. Article 368                                   :  Amendment of the Constitution
    4. Article 356                                   :  President's Rule in a State

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Article 32 correctly guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, including the right to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of Fundamental Rights.  Article 370, though now repealed, previously granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 368 correctly outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution.  Article 356 correctly deals with the imposition of President's rule in a state.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of crucial articles of the Indian Constitution and their functions. The inclusion of all correct answers makes this a challenging question, demanding a deep understanding of the Indian constitutional framework.


10. **Consider the following pairs:**

    Fundamental Right                                    Article
    1. Right to Equality                                :  Article 17
    2. Right to Freedom                                 :  Article 20
    3. Right against Exploitation                         :  Article 24
    4. Right to Freedom of Religion                       :  Article 25

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 17 deals with the abolition of untouchability, not the right to equality, which is covered by Articles 14-18. Article 20 protects against ex-post facto laws and double jeopardy, not the entire right to freedom, which encompasses Articles 19-22. Article 24 correctly prohibits the employment of children in hazardous work. Article 25 correctly guarantees the freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Fundamental Rights and their corresponding articles.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's detailed understanding of the rights guaranteed under Part III of the Indian Constitution.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Body/Position
1. Article 148                     :   Attorney General of India
2. Article 280                     :   Union Public Service Commission
3. Article 315                     :   Finance Commission
4. Article 323 (A)                 :   Comptroller and Auditor General of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 148 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), outlining its establishment, functions, and responsibilities.  Article 280 pertains to the Finance Commission, a body responsible for recommending the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States. Article 315 concerns the establishment of Public Service Commissions at the Union and State levels. Finally, Article 323(A) relates to Administrative Tribunals, designed to provide a mechanism for resolving disputes related to government service.  Therefore, only the pair linking Article 148 to the CAG is correctly matched. The other pairs incorrectly associate the articles with different constitutional bodies. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional provisions related to the mentioned entities.  Understanding the specific functions and jurisdictions of each constitutional body is crucial for accurate matching.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to differentiate between closely related constitutional articles and their corresponding bodies.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body             Key Function/Responsibility
1. Finance Commission             :   Audits government accounts
2. Comptroller and Auditor General :   Recommends principles governing financial distribution between Union and States
3. Union Public Service Commission :   Conducts recruitment for All-India Services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is primarily responsible for conducting examinations and recruitment for All-India Services and other central government positions. The Finance Commission's core responsibility is to recommend principles for the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States. This includes examining the financial position of the Union and States and making recommendations on grants-in-aid and other fiscal transfers. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits the accounts of the Union and State governments, ensuring accountability and transparency in public spending. Thus, only the pair relating the UPSC to All-India Services recruitment is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly assign the functions of the CAG and the Finance Commission. This question tests factual recall and the ability to accurately associate key functions with their respective constitutional bodies.  It highlights the need for precise knowledge of the roles of these vital institutions within the Indian governmental structure.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body            Source of Funding/Compensation
1. Finance Commission           :   Contingency Fund of India
2. Comptroller and Auditor General:   Parliamentary Allocations
3. Union Public Service Commission:   Taxes and duties levied by the Union

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) receives its funding through parliamentary allocations, reflecting its role as an independent constitutional body. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is also funded by the Union government, primarily from taxes and other duties levied by the Union. The Finance Commission, however, does not directly receive funding from the Contingency Fund of India. Instead, its recommendations regarding financial distribution influence the allocation of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India, but the Commission itself has its own budget approved by the Parliament. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 correctly match the funding sources with the respective bodies. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the financial mechanisms that support key constitutional bodies and the subtle differences in their funding arrangements.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body           Reporting Authority/Structure
1. Finance Commission           :   State Legislature
2. Comptroller and Auditor General:   President of India
3. Union Public Service Commission:   Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submits its reports to the President, who then lays them before Parliament. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) also submits its annual reports to the Parliament, maintaining its accountability. The Finance Commission, however, does not directly report to the State Legislature. While its recommendations impact State finances, its reports are submitted to the President, who then presents them to Parliament.  The State Legislature may discuss the Commission’s report but does not directly receive it. Thus, only options 2 and 3 accurately reflect the reporting structures of these constitutional bodies. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the accountability mechanisms within the Indian governmental framework, requiring a nuanced understanding of the reporting relationships of different constitutional bodies.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   State                                     Specific Feature
1. Assam                                   :   Mara Autonomous District
2. Meghalaya                               :   Chakma Autonomous District
3. Tripura                                 :   Khasi Hills Autonomous District
4. Mizoram                                :   Bodoland Territorial Region

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the administration of tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  However, the specific autonomous districts and regions mentioned in the pairs are incorrectly assigned to the states.  Assam includes the Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao districts, Meghalaya has Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills, and Garo Hills districts. Tripura has the Tripura Tribal Areas District, and Mizoram has Chakma, Mara, and Lai districts.  The Bodoland Territorial Region is located in Assam, not Mizoram.  Therefore, none of the pairs is correctly matched. This question tests factual recall and requires in-depth knowledge of the administrative structure of the tribal areas in Northeast India as detailed in the Sixth Schedule.  The incorrect pairs act as effective distractors, demanding precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act     Specific Constitutional Schedule Affected
1. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992        :   Fourth Schedule
2. 74th Amendment Act, 1992        :   Eleventh Schedule
3. 52nd Amendment Act, 1985        :   Tenth Schedule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The 74th Amendment Act of 1992 added the Twelfth Schedule to the Constitution, dealing with municipalities. The 52nd Amendment Act of 1985 introduced the Tenth Schedule, which addresses anti-defection laws. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 added the Eleventh Schedule, concerning Panchayats. The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 correctly link the Constitutional Amendment Acts with the Schedules they affected. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of the Indian Constitution through amendments, requiring knowledge of specific amendment acts and the schedules they altered.  The incorrect pairing serves as a strong distractor, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of constitutional history.


**7. With reference to the allocation of financial resources in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Institution                  Role in Resource Allocation
1. Finance Commission                :   Allocates funds to Panchayats and Municipalities only
2. Union Government                  :   Receives all Union tax revenues
3. State Governments                 :   Collects all State tax revenues

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Union Government receives all revenues collected through Union taxes. State Governments similarly collect revenues from State taxes. The Finance Commission's role in resource allocation is broader than only Panchayats and Municipalities; it recommends the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States, which then trickles down to local bodies.  While the Finance Commission’s recommendations influence funding for Panchayats and Municipalities, it's not its sole function. The other two pairs accurately describe the revenue streams of the Union and State Governments. This question assesses understanding of the complex financial architecture of the Indian federation, requiring knowledge of both Union and State roles, and the Finance Commission's broader mandate. The inclusion of an incomplete description of the Finance Commission's role acts as a significant distractor.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Schedule of the Indian Constitution    Subject Matter
1. Fourth Schedule                        :   Languages
2. Eleventh Schedule                      :   Panchayati Raj
3. Sixth Schedule                         :   Administration of tribal areas in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Fourth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the allocation of seats in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha). The Eleventh Schedule lists the 29 functional items of Panchayati Raj institutions. The Sixth Schedule deals with the administration of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, not Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Goa.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 correctly match the schedules with their subject matter. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the schedules of the Indian Constitution, requiring precise recall of the subject matter of each schedule and identification of incorrect geographical references.  The inclusion of a factually incorrect statement in pair 3 serves as a crucial distractor.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body              Appointment Process
1. Finance Commission                : Appointed by the Prime Minister
2. Comptroller and Auditor General  : Appointed by the President
3. Union Public Service Commission :  Appointed by the Governor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is appointed by the President of India. The Finance Commission is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister, based on the recommendation of the President. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) members are also appointed by the President, not the Governor.  Therefore, only the pair concerning the CAG's appointment process is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the appointment procedures for key constitutional bodies, emphasizing the role of the President in appointing both the CAG and the members of the UPSC.  Incorrect options involving the Prime Minister and Governor serve as effective distractors.


**10. With reference to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                           Source of Inspiration
1.  Sovereign, Socialist, Secular     :  Soviet Constitution
2.  Democratic, Republic            :  American Constitution
3.  Justice, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity : French Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The ideals of Justice, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity in the Indian Preamble are inspired by the French Revolution and the French Constitution. The concepts of Sovereign, Socialist, and Secular were added later through the 42nd Amendment. While the American Constitution influenced the concepts of a democratic republic, the Soviet Constitution's influence is primarily seen in the incorporation of socialist ideals into the Preamble.  The pair connecting Democratic and Republic to the American Constitution is accurate, but the other pairings require a nuanced understanding of the historical and ideological influences on the drafting of the Preamble.  This question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the influences on the Preamble, requiring knowledge of multiple constitutional sources and their impact on the Indian Constitution's foundational principles.  The incorrect pairing serves as a distractor, requiring careful analysis.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the Indian Constitution, its key figures, and the Supreme Court's role.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                                    Role/Association
    1. Dr. Rajendra Prasad                   :   Member, Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution
    2. B.R. Ambedkar                         :   President, Constituent Assembly
    3. B.N. Rau                              :   Legal advisor to the Constituent Assembly
    4. K.M. Munshi                           :   Chairman, Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

B.N. Rau served as the principal legal advisor to the Constituent Assembly, playing a crucial role in drafting the Constitution.  K.M. Munshi chaired the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, significantly contributing to their inclusion in the Constitution.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad was not a member of the Drafting Committee; B.R. Ambedkar chaired the Drafting Committee, not the Constituent Assembly.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the President of the Constituent Assembly.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly link individuals to roles they did not hold. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to differentiate between various roles and responsibilities within the Constituent Assembly and the Constitution-making process.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Article Number                     Subject Matter
    1. Article 44                         :   Organization of Village Panchayats
    2. Article 40                         :   Uniform Civil Code
    3. Article 39A                        :   Equal Justice and Free Legal Aid
    4. Article 48                         :   Organization of Agriculture

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 39A of the Indian Constitution deals with equal justice and free legal aid. Article 40 addresses the organization of village panchayats, while Article 44 advocates for a uniform civil code.  Article 48 relates to the organization of agriculture and animal husbandry, not solely agriculture. Option (c) is correct because it accurately identifies the subject matter of Article 39A. The other options contain mismatched pairs, testing the candidate's ability to recall and accurately associate articles with their respective subject matters. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act                                      Key Provision/Impact
    1. Government of India Act, 1858      :   Introduced dyarchy in provinces.
    2. Indian Councils Act, 1892          :   Increased Indian representation in legislative councils.
    3. Indian Councils Act, 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms) :  Introduced separate electorates.
    4. Government of India Act, 1935      :   Separation of Burma from India.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did indeed increase Indian representation in legislative councils, expanding limited participation in governance. The Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms) introduced separate electorates for Muslims, a significant step in communal politics. The Government of India Act of 1858 transferred power from the East India Company to the British Crown, and the Government of India Act of 1935 introduced provincial autonomy, not dyarchy. The separation of Burma from India occurred through the Indian Independence Act of 1947.  Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of significant historical acts and their provisions, assessing factual recall and analytical skills.


**4. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Jurisdiction                                     Legal Basis/Characteristic
    1. Original Jurisdiction in inter-state water disputes :   Article 131
    2. Appellate Jurisdiction over High Courts         :   Article 132
    3. Advisory Jurisdiction on Presidential references :   Article 143
    4. Power to issue writs                             :   Article 32

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction over High Courts is established by Article 132 of the Constitution.  Article 143 empowers the President to seek the Supreme Court's opinion on any legal matter, forming the basis of its advisory jurisdiction. Article 131 grants original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States or between States, but not specifically inter-state water disputes.   Article 32, while related to the Supreme Court's power to issue writs, is primarily concerned with the enforcement of fundamental rights, not the general writ jurisdiction. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are accurately matched.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Supreme Court's various jurisdictions, assessing factual recall and analytical skills.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body                     Appointment Authority
    1. Union Public Service Commission      :   Parliament
    2. Comptroller and Auditor General    :   President
    3. Election Commission of India          :   Parliament
    4. Finance Commission                   :   President


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 2 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is appointed by the President. The Finance Commission is also appointed by the President. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and the Election Commission of India are not appointed by the President; their members are appointed by the President on the advice of the government.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the appointment procedures for various constitutional bodies, assessing factual recall and analytical skills.


**6. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bill                                   Special Feature
    1. Money Bill                                 :   Can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha
    2. Financial Bill                             :   Requires the President's recommendation for introduction
    3. Constitutional Amendment Bill             :   Requires a special majority for passage
    4. Private Member's Bill                       :  Always passed by a simple majority

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Money Bills can only originate in the Lok Sabha.  Financial Bills require the President's recommendation for introduction. Constitutional Amendment Bills require a special majority for passage.  Private Member's Bills can be passed by a simple or special majority depending on the bill's nature. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of different types of bills and their passage through Parliament, testing factual recall and analytical abilities.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Act/Reform                 Impact on Indian Governance
    1. Charter Act of 1833                  :   Established a separate legislative council for India
    2. Indian Councils Act of 1861          :   Introduced a system of dyarchy in the provinces
    3. Government of India Act of 1919      :   Provided for the establishment of a Federal Court
    4. Government of India Act of 1935      :   Introduced a bicameral legislature at the Centre


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Charter Act of 1833 established a legislative council for the Governor-General of India. The Government of India Act of 1935 established a bicameral legislature at the centre, which comprised of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and the Federal Assembly (Lok Sabha).  The Indian Councils Act of 1861 did not introduce dyarchy; that came later with the Government of India Act of 1919.  The Government of India Act of 1919 did introduce dyarchy in provinces, but it did not provide for a Federal Court; this was a feature of the Government of India Act of 1935. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the evolution of the Indian legislative system, assessing factual recall and analytical skills.




**8.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment Act          Significant Change Related to the President
    1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976           :   Reduced the President's discretionary powers
    2. 44th Amendment Act, 1978           :   Strengthened the President's powers in financial matters
    3. 52nd Amendment Act, 1985           :   Clarified the President's role in the appointment of Governors
    4. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992           :   Established an electoral college for the President


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The 52nd Amendment Act, 1985, primarily dealt with the anti-defection law but also clarified the President's role in the appointment of Governors.  The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly expanded the scope of the powers of the Parliament, and the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 also curbed the powers of the Parliament. The 73rd Amendment Act did not change the President's electoral college.  The other options contain inaccurate pairings of amendments and their impact on the President's powers.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of constitutional amendments and their effects on the executive branch, evaluating their understanding of constitutional evolution and analytical skills.




**9. With reference to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Term in the Preamble                    Meaning/Implication
    1. Sovereign                               :   India is a monarchy
    2. Socialist                                :   India's commitment to social welfare
    3. Secular                                 :   India is a theocratic state
    4. Democratic                              :   India's commitment to the rule of law
    5. Republic                               :   India is a parliamentary democracy


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

"Socialist" in the Preamble reflects India's commitment to a social welfare state and reducing socioeconomic inequalities. "Democratic" signifies the commitment to the principles of democracy, including popular sovereignty and the rule of law.  "Sovereign" means India is an independent state, not a monarchy. "Secular" means India is a non-theocratic state. "Republic" means India is a state where the head of the state is elected, not a hereditary monarch; it does not define the system of government as parliamentary. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses understanding of the key terms in the Preamble and their implications, testing conceptual understanding and analytical skills.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept                             Supreme Court Judgement/Doctrine
    1.  Basic Structure Doctrine                :   Kesavananda Bharati Case
    2.  Doctrine of Severability                :   Minerva Mills Case
    3.  Doctrine of Prospective Overruling   :   Golaknath Case
    4.  Judicial Review                         :   Berubari Union Case

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 1 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 only


**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) is landmark for establishing the "basic structure" doctrine, limiting Parliament's amending power.  The other options incorrectly link legal concepts to Supreme Court judgements.  The Doctrine of Severability was not primarily established in Minerva Mills, although it was discussed. The Doctrine of Prospective Overruling is associated with the Golaknath case, but the court didn't explicitly create the doctrine.  The Berubari Union case dealt with the extent of Parliament's power to cede territory but did not primarily establish the concept of judicial review.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of landmark Supreme Court cases and their legal doctrines, assessing factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills.  The close relationship between the distractor options makes the question more challenging.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act       Provision Added/Amended
1. 42nd Amendment Act (1976)          :   Added "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity" to the Preamble
2. 44th Amendment Act (1978)          :   Removed "Right to Property" from Fundamental Rights
3. 86th Amendment Act (2002)          :   Added the right to education as a Fundamental Right
4. 73rd Amendment Act (1992)          :   Added Part IX dealing with Panchayats
5. 74th Amendment Act (1992)          :   Added Part IX-A dealing with Municipalities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched.  The 42nd Amendment significantly altered the Preamble by incorporating the socialist, secular, and integrity aspects, reflecting a shift in the nation's ideological stance. The 44th Amendment removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights, reclassifying it as a legal right under Article 300-A. The 86th Amendment enshrined the Right to Education as a Fundamental Right, making education accessible to children between the ages of 6 and 14. The 73rd and 74th Amendments introduced significant changes to the structure of local governance by adding Part IX (Panchayats) and Part IX-A (Municipalities) respectively, which were landmark steps in decentralization.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the correct matching of all the pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution     Subject Matter
1. Article 51A                               :   Directive Principles of State Policy
2. Article 32                                 :   Enforcement of Fundamental Rights
3. Article 368                                :   Amendment of the Constitution
4. Article 37                                 :   Directive Principles of State Policy are not enforceable by courts
5. Article 123                               :   President's Ordinance-Making Power

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Articles 32, 368, and 123 are correctly paired with their respective subjects. Article 32 deals with the right to constitutional remedies, which is a crucial aspect of the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. Article 123 grants the President the power to issue ordinances during parliamentary recess. However, Article 51A relates to Fundamental Duties, not Directive Principles of State Policy, which are found in Part IV, and Article 37 clarifies the non-justiciable nature of Directive Principles, not that they are themselves part of the subject matter of the article.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Act                                  Key Feature
1. Government of India Act, 1909                :   Introduction of Dyarchy at the provincial level
2. Government of India Act, 1919                :   Introduction of Dyarchy at the central level
3. Government of India Act, 1935                :   Establishment of a Federal System
4. Indian Independence Act, 1947               :   Grant of Independence to India and Pakistan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 is correctly matched with the establishment of a federal system. This Act laid the foundation for a federal structure in India, although it was not fully implemented before independence. The Indian Independence Act of 1947 is correctly matched with the granting of independence to India and Pakistan, marking the end of British rule. However, the Government of India Act, 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms) introduced communal representation and the expansion of legislative councils, not Dyarchy at the provincial level.  Dyarchy at the provincial level was introduced by the Government of India Act, 1919 (Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms). Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (c) is the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                      Mode of Appointment
1. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)   :   Appointed by the Parliament
2. Election Commission of India             :   Appointed by the President
3. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Appointed by the President
4. Finance Commission                      :   Appointed by the President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India, the Union Public Service Commission, and the Finance Commission are all appointed by the President of India.  This is a key aspect of their constitutional position, ensuring a degree of independence from the executive branch.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is, however, appointed by the President, not the Parliament.  The President appoints the CAG on the advice of the Prime Minister. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Constitutional Provision       Feature Borrowed
1. Government of India Act, 1935          :   Directive Principles of State Policy
2. British Constitution                    :   Parliamentary Government System
3. US Constitution                         :   Fundamental Rights
4. Irish Constitution                      :   Emergency Provisions
5. Canadian Constitution                   :   Federal Scheme with a strong Centre

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The British Constitution served as a model for India's parliamentary system. The US Constitution influenced the inclusion of Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution. The Canadian Constitution provided the framework for a federal structure with a strong central government in India. However, Directive Principles of State Policy were primarily influenced by the Irish Constitution, not the Government of India Act of 1935, although the 1935 Act did contain some elements that foreshadowed them. Emergency provisions were inspired by several sources, including the Weimar Constitution, and not solely the Irish Constitution. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (b) is the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   List in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution     Type of Subject
1. Union List                                               :   Matters relating to Defence
2. State List                                                :   Matters relating to Public Order
3. Concurrent List                                          :   Matters relating to Criminal Law
4. Residuary Powers                                          :   Matters not explicitly mentioned in other lists

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Union List encompasses subjects of national importance such as defense, which requires uniformity across the country. The State List includes subjects like public order, which are best managed at the state level.  The Concurrent List contains subjects like criminal law, allowing both the Union and State governments to legislate. The Residuary Powers are vested in the Union government, covering areas not specified in the Union, State or Concurrent Lists. Therefore, option (b) is correct.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee related to Constitutional Amendments     Recommendation
1. Swaran Singh Committee                       :   Inclusion of Fundamental Duties
2. Sarkaria Commission                         :   Centre-State relations
3. Punchhi Commission                          :   Centre-State relations
4. Rajamannar Committee                       :   Restructuring of Centre-State relations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The Swaran Singh Committee recommended the inclusion of Fundamental Duties in the Constitution. The Sarkaria Commission and Punchhi Commission both dealt with Centre-State relations, focusing on improving intergovernmental coordination and resolving disputes. The Rajamannar Committee also focused on Centre-State relations, advocating for greater state autonomy. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is the correct answer.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) on Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy, and Fundamental Duties,  incorporating the provided target content.  The questions are designed to be challenging and avoid obvious answers.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                       Provision
1. Article 14                                   :   Right to Constitutional Remedies
2. Article 19                                   :   Protection of life and personal liberty
3. Article 21                                   :   Right to freedom of speech and expression
4. Article 32                                   :   Equality before the law
5. Article 51A                                  :   Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. Article 51A of the Indian Constitution enumerates the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens.  The other options present incorrect pairings. Article 14 deals with equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, not the right to constitutional remedies (Article 32). Article 19 guarantees six freedoms, including freedom of speech and expression, while Article 21 protects the right to life and personal liberty. Article 32 is the right to constitutional remedies, not equality before the law. The incorrect pairings are designed as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of constitutional articles and their provisions.  A thorough understanding of the fundamental rights is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                     Constitutional Location
1.  Fundamental Rights                         :   Part IV-A
2.  Directive Principles of State Policy       :   Part III
3.  Fundamental Duties                         :   Part IV
4.  Right to Constitutional Remedies          :   Part III


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Fundamental Duties are enshrined in Part IV-A of the Indian Constitution (Article 51A).  Fundamental Rights are located in Part III, while Directive Principles of State Policy are in Part IV. The right to constitutional remedies, which is a crucial aspect of Fundamental Rights, is also within Part III.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific parts of the Constitution where these key legal principles are enshrined. The incorrect options are carefully constructed to challenge candidates' understanding and ability to distinguish between closely related constitutional provisions.


**3. With reference to the relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Relationship                                 Description
1.  Complementary                             :   DPSPs are legally enforceable, FRs are not.
2.  Supplementary                             :   FRs guarantee individual liberties; DPSPs outline social and economic goals.
3.  Conflicting                               :   In case of conflict, FRs prevail.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy are indeed supplementary, with FRs focusing on individual liberties and DPSPs outlining social and economic goals for the state to strive towards. In case of conflict between a Fundamental Right and a Directive Principle, the courts have generally held that Fundamental Rights prevail, as they are justiciable.  Pair 1 is incorrect because it reverses the justiciability:  Fundamental Rights are justiciable (enforceable in courts), while Directive Principles are not. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the nuanced relationship between these two crucial components of the Indian Constitution, highlighting the potential for conflict and the established precedence in such scenarios.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment Act                            Effect on Fundamental Rights
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976                :   Removed the right to property as a Fundamental Right
2. 44th Amendment Act, 1978                :   Added socialist, secular, and integrity to the Preamble
3. 86th Amendment Act, 2002               :   Made the right to education a Fundamental Right
4. 97th Amendment Act, 2011               :   Introduced Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The 86th Amendment Act, 2002, indeed added the right to education as a Fundamental Right under Article 21A. The other options present incorrect pairings. The 42nd Amendment Act added socialist, secular, and integrity to the Preamble, not removing the right to property (that happened with the 44th Amendment).  The 44th Amendment Act removed the right to property as a Fundamental Right, not adding the words to the Preamble. The 97th Amendment Act did not introduce Fundamental Duties; they were already present (Article 51A).  This question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific constitutional amendment acts and their effects on Fundamental Rights, requiring precise knowledge of Indian constitutional history. The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's detailed recall of amendment acts and their consequences.



**5. With reference to Fundamental Rights and their limitations, consider the following pairs:**

   Right                                      Limitation
1. Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression :  Reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order
2. Right to Life and Personal Liberty        :   Preventive detention under Article 22
3. Right to Equality                         :   Affirmative action for Scheduled Castes and Tribes
4. Right to Freedom of Religion              :   Public order


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Each Fundamental Right mentioned has specific limitations.  Freedom of speech and expression is subject to reasonable restrictions to maintain public order.  The right to life and personal liberty can be limited by preventive detention under Article 22.  The right to equality allows for affirmative action to uplift Scheduled Castes and Tribes.  Freedom of religion is also subject to limitations in the interest of public order. This question tests not only the knowledge of Fundamental Rights but also their crucial limitations, emphasizing a comprehensive understanding of the balance between individual liberties and societal needs. The inclusion of all correct pairs makes this a challenging question, requiring in-depth knowledge of the subject.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body                      Function related to Fundamental Rights
1.  National Human Rights Commission       :    Enforces Fundamental Rights directly.
2.  Supreme Court                          :    Protects Fundamental Rights through judicial review.
3.  High Courts                             :    Investigates human rights violations.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in protecting Fundamental Rights through its power of judicial review. It can declare laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights as null and void. The National Human Rights Commission investigates human rights violations, but it does not directly enforce Fundamental Rights; its recommendations are advisory. High Courts also have jurisdiction to protect Fundamental Rights through writs, but their primary function is not investigating human rights violations.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles of different constitutional bodies in safeguarding Fundamental Rights, requiring knowledge beyond simple definition and going into the specific functions of each body.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's nuanced understanding of the topic.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to property was a Fundamental Right in the original Constitution of India.
2.  The right to property is now a legal right under Article 300A.
3.  The Supreme Court can enforce Directive Principles of State Policy directly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The right to property, originally a Fundamental Right (Article 31), was removed from Part III by the 44th Amendment Act, 1978, and is now a Constitutional right under Article 300A. Statement 1 is incorrect because the right to property was removed as a fundamental right.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the Directive Principles are non-justiciable; the Supreme Court cannot directly enforce them. This question tests the understanding of the evolution of the right to property within the Indian Constitution and the nature of Directive Principles. The incorrect options are designed as plausible distractors, requiring the candidates to have precise knowledge of the legal status of these rights.


**8. With reference to the  Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Subject                                    List
1.  Police                                     :   Union List
2.  Education                                  :   State List
3.  Forestry                                   :   Concurrent List
4.  Atomic Energy                              :   State List
5.  Census                                     :   Concurrent List

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Education is primarily a State List subject. Forestry is a Concurrent List subject, meaning both the Union and State governments can legislate on it. Census is also a Concurrent List subject.  Pair 1 is incorrect because Police is a State List subject. Pair 4 is incorrect because Atomic Energy falls under the Union List.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the distribution of powers between the Union and the States under the Seventh Schedule. The inclusion of plausible distractors increases the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge of subject allocation to the different lists.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                          Key Feature
1. Regulating Act, 1773                        :   Established the Board of Control
2. Pitt's India Act, 1784                      :   Appointment of a Law Member in the Governor-General's Council
3. Charter Act, 1813                          :   Establishment of the Supreme Court in Calcutta
4. Charter Act, 1833                          :   Permission to English missionaries to work in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Charter Act of 1833 permitted English missionaries to work in India. The other pairs contain incorrect information. The Regulating Act of 1773 established the Supreme Court in Calcutta, not the Board of Control (which came with Pitt's India Act). The Pitt's India Act of 1784 created the Board of Control, not the appointment of a Law Member (that happened later). The Charter Act of 1813 granted permission to Christian missionaries to work in India, not the Supreme Court's establishment. This question tests detailed knowledge of the historical evolution of British rule in India, requiring accurate recall of legislative acts and their specific provisions.  The carefully constructed distractors necessitate a precise understanding of 18th and 19th-century Indian history.



**10.  With reference to the Indian Constitution's sources, consider the following pairs:**

    Source                                       Feature Borrowed
1. Government of India Act, 1935              :   Fundamental Rights
2. British Constitution                         :   Directive Principles of State Policy
3. Irish Constitution                           :   Federation with a strong Centre
4. Canadian Constitution                      :   Concurrent List
5. Australian Constitution                     :   Method of election of the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Concurrent List in the Indian Constitution was borrowed from the Australian Constitution. The other pairings are incorrect.  The Government of India Act, 1935, provided the framework for the federal scheme, not Fundamental Rights (though it influenced them). The Directive Principles of State Policy were inspired by the Irish Constitution.  The Federation with a strong centre was influenced by several sources, including the Canadian Constitution, but not exclusively. The method of election of the President was influenced by various sources and not solely by the Australian Constitution. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the diverse sources that influenced the framing of the Indian Constitution. The carefully chosen distractors ensure that only candidates with a strong understanding of constitutional history will answer correctly.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                          Prominent Feature
1. Indian Councils Act of 1861                   :   Introduced the principle of election in India
2. Indian Councils Act of 1892                   :   Expanded the legislative councils
3. Government of India Act of 1919               :   Introduced dyarchy in provinces
4. Government of India Act of 1935               :   Established an All-India Federation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Councils Act of 1861, while not introducing widespread elections, did mark the first instance of introducing an element of election in the Indian legislative councils.  The Act of 1892 significantly expanded the legislative councils, increasing the number of elected members. The Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced the system of dyarchy, dividing power between Indian ministers and British officials in the provinces.  Finally, the Government of India Act of 1935 established a federal structure with an All-India Federation, a crucial step towards greater Indian self-governance. All the pairs are thus correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act              Provision Added/Amended
1. 42nd Amendment Act                         :   Inserted the word "Secular" in the Preamble
2. 44th Amendment Act                         :   Deleted the Right to Property as a Fundamental Right
3. 73rd Amendment Act                        :   Added Part IX to the Constitution dealing with Panchayats
4. 74th Amendment Act                        :   Added Part IX-A to the Constitution dealing with Municipalities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Preamble by adding the words "socialist," "secular," and "integrity."  The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights, placing it as a legal right under Article 300A.  The 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts of 1992 introduced Part IX and Part IX-A respectively, establishing the constitutional framework for Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local bodies.  Therefore, all four pairs are accurately matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                      Subject Matter
1. Article 112                               :   Annual Financial Statement (Budget)
2. Article 265                               :   Prohibition of taxes without authorization of law
3. Article 117                               :   Money bills can originate only in Lok Sabha
4. Article 352                               :   Proclamation of Emergency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 112 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Annual Financial Statement, commonly known as the Union Budget. Article 265 prohibits the levying of taxes except by the authority of law. Article 117 specifies that money bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. Article 352 outlines the procedure for the proclamation of a national emergency.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Act                             Key Feature Introduced
1. Government of India Act, 1919              :   Provincial Autonomy
2. Government of India Act, 1935              :   Dyarchy at the Centre
3. Indian Independence Act, 1947              :   Transfer of Power
4. Indian Councils Act, 1892                  :   Communal Representation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1919 did not introduce Provincial Autonomy; it introduced Dyarchy at the Provincial level. The Government of India Act of 1935 did not introduce Dyarchy at the Centre; it established a federal structure. The Indian Independence Act of 1947 is correctly paired with the transfer of power to India. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 is correctly paired with the introduction of communal representation. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

The Finance Commission is responsible for recommending the principles guiding the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States and grants-in-aid to States. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) investigates allegations of human rights violations. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is involved in preventing corruption in government and enforcing the code of conduct for civil servants. The State Election Commission (SEC) conducts elections to local bodies, such as Panchayats and Municipalities. All pairs are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Schedule of the Constitution                Subject Matter
1.  Eleventh Schedule                        :   Panchayats
2.  Twelfth Schedule                         :   Municipalities
3.  Ninth Schedule                            :   Certain laws relating to land reforms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Eleventh Schedule, added by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992, deals with the powers, authority, and responsibilities of Panchayats. The Twelfth Schedule, also added by the 73rd Amendment, deals with Municipalities. The Ninth Schedule initially protected certain land reform laws from judicial review, although this protection has been partially curtailed by Supreme Court rulings.  The Tenth Schedule, added by the 52nd Amendment Act of 1985, deals with the anti-defection law.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Constitutional Provisions          Specific Feature
1. Government of India Act, 1935            :   Federal Scheme
2. British Constitution                       :   Parliamentary System
3. US Constitution                           :   Judicial Review
4. Irish Constitution                         :   Directive Principles of State Policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution borrowed significantly from various sources. The Government of India Act, 1935, served as a major source for the federal scheme of the Indian Constitution. The British Constitution provided the foundation for the parliamentary system in India.  The US Constitution influenced the incorporation of the concept of judicial review. The Irish Constitution was the source for the Directive Principles of State Policy. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body              Head/Appointing Authority
1. Union Public Service Commission : Prime Minister
2. Election Commission of India     : President
3. Supreme Court of India           : Chief Justice of India
4. Finance Commission               : President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correct pairs are 2 and 4. The Election Commission of India's Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President of India.  The Finance Commission is also appointed by the President. Option 1 is incorrect because the Chairman and members of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) are appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister plays no role in the appointment of UPSC members. Option 3 is incorrect because the Chief Justice of India is the head of the Supreme Court but the Judges themselves are appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice and other Judges. The Chief Justice does not appoint the other judges.  Therefore, only options 2 and 4 represent accurate pairings.  Understanding the appointing authorities for these crucial constitutional bodies is essential for comprehending the Indian governmental structure and the checks and balances within it.  The question tests factual recall about the structure of key constitutional bodies and their relationship with the executive branch.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                      Key Constitutional Provision
1. Parliament                           : Article 79
2. Council of Ministers                  : Article 74
3. Rajya Sabha                           : Article 80
4. Lok Sabha                             : Article 81
5. President's Rule                      : Article 356


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 79 of the Constitution deals with the composition of Parliament, Article 74 with the Council of Ministers, Article 80 with the composition of the Rajya Sabha, Article 81 with the composition of the Lok Sabha, and Article 356 with the power of the President to impose President's Rule in a State.  This question tests factual knowledge about the fundamental articles of the Indian Constitution that define the structure of the government and the emergency provisions.  A thorough understanding of these articles is crucial for comprehending the framework of Indian governance. The inclusion of multiple correct pairs increases the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge rather than relying on partial recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   High Court Function                 Constitutional Basis
1. Writ Jurisdiction                     : Article 226
2. Power of Superintendence             : Article 227
3. Original Jurisdiction in Revenue Matters: Article 246
4. Appellate Jurisdiction               : Article 136


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Article 226 of the Indian Constitution grants High Courts the power to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and other legal remedies. Article 227 empowers High Courts to supervise the functioning of subordinate courts.  Option 3 is incorrect as Article 246 deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States, not the original jurisdiction of High Courts in revenue matters.  While High Courts may have original jurisdiction in revenue matters, it's not specifically mentioned in Article 246.  Option 4 is incorrect; Article 136 pertains to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction, not the High Courts.  This question assesses the student's understanding of the specific constitutional provisions governing the jurisdiction and powers of High Courts, demanding precise knowledge of the relevant articles.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Power                     Constitutional Article
1.  Appointment of Chief Minister     : Article 163
2.  Dissolution of State Legislative Assembly: Article 174
3.  Ordinance-making Power            : Article 213
4.  Pardoning Power                     : Article 161


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correctly matched pairs are 1, 3, and 4.  Article 163 relates to the Governor’s power to appoint the Chief Minister. Article 213 deals with the Governor's power to promulgate ordinances. Article 161 gives the Governor the power of pardon.  Option 2 is incorrect. While the Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly under Article 356 (President's Rule),  Article 174 deals with the sessions of the State Legislature, not its dissolution. This question tests the student's knowledge of the specific powers of the Governor as outlined in the Constitution, requiring them to differentiate between the articles governing various gubernatorial functions. The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as Article 174, increases the difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Emergency                  Constitutional Article
1. National Emergency                 : Article 356
2. State Emergency (President's Rule) : Article 352
3. Financial Emergency                : Article 360
4. Constitutional Breakdown           : Article 365


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Article 360 of the Constitution deals with the proclamation of a financial emergency.  Option 1 is incorrect; Article 356 deals with the proclamation of President's Rule in a State, which is a State emergency, not a national emergency.  Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a national emergency.  Option 4 is incorrect; Article 365 deals with the failure of a state to comply with the directions of the Union, leading to potential action, but not directly proclaiming an emergency.  This question tests the understanding of the different types of emergencies under the Indian Constitution and the articles that govern them.  The incorrect options are designed to be plausible distractors, making the question challenging.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                          Key Constitutional Change
1. 42nd Amendment Act (1976)           : Added Fundamental Duties
2. 73rd Amendment Act (1992)           : Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 74th Amendment Act (1992)           : Established Municipalities
4. First Amendment Act (1951)           : Added the Ninth Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The 42nd Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 73rd Amendment Act provided constitutional status to Panchayati Raj institutions. The 74th Amendment Act similarly gave constitutional status to Municipalities. The First Amendment Act added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, which was intended to protect certain laws from judicial review.  This question tests the student's knowledge of significant constitutional amendments and their impact on the Indian political system.  The inclusion of multiple correct pairs requires thorough knowledge of the subject matter.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                     Focus Area
1. Balwantray Mehta Committee                  : Community Development Programme
2. Ashok Mehta Committee                       : Two-tier Panchayati Raj System
3. G.V.K. Rao Committee                       : Existing Administrative Arrangements for Rural Development
4. L.M. Singhvi Committee                     : Panchayati Raj Elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Ashok Mehta Committee recommended a two-tier Panchayati Raj system. The G.V.K. Rao Committee focused on existing administrative arrangements for rural development. The L.M. Singhvi Committee dealt with Panchayati Raj elections.  Option 1 is incorrect; the Balwantray Mehta Committee's primary focus was on the three-tier Panchayati Raj system, not solely on the Community Development Programme, although the CDP was a relevant context.  This question tests the student's knowledge of various committees that have studied and shaped the Panchayati Raj system in India.  The incorrect pairing serves as a distractor, demanding precise knowledge of each committee's mandate.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                                  Constitutional Location
1. Fundamental Rights                             : Part IV
2. Directive Principles of State Policy           : Part III
3. Fundamental Duties                             : Part IV-A
4. Emergency Provisions                           : Part XVIII


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Fundamental Duties are enshrined in Part IV-A of the Constitution. Emergency provisions are detailed in Part XVIII.  Option 1 is incorrect; Fundamental Rights are found in Part III.  Option 2 is also incorrect; Directive Principles of State Policy are located in Part IV.  This question tests the student's knowledge of the location of key legal concepts within the Indian Constitution, requiring precise recall of the constitutional parts where these concepts are defined. The strategically placed incorrect options increase the question's difficulty.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                                   Key Characteristic
1. Fundamental Rights                               : Non-justiciable
2. Directive Principles of State Policy              : Justiciable
3. Fundamental Duties                               : Non-justiciable
4. Emergency Provisions                            : Suspensive


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Fundamental Duties are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts. Emergency provisions, particularly under Article 356 (President's Rule), can have a suspensive effect on certain fundamental rights.  Option 1 is incorrect; Fundamental Rights are justiciable.  Option 2 is incorrect; Directive Principles are non-justiciable.  This question tests the student's understanding of the justiciability of various legal concepts within the Indian Constitution, requiring an understanding of the legal implications of each concept. The incorrect options are designed to challenge the student's knowledge.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Area Provision                    Constitutional Feature
1.  Tribes Advisory Council                 : Part X, Article 244
2.  Governor's Power of Direction           : Fifth Schedule
3.  President's Power to Declare Areas     : Sixth Schedule
4.  Annual Report to the President           : Fifth Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The Tribes Advisory Council is mentioned in Part X, Article 244 of the Constitution. The Governor's power of direction regarding scheduled areas is a feature of the Fifth Schedule. The Governor's submission of annual reports on the administration of scheduled areas to the President is also a feature of the Fifth Schedule. Option 3 is incorrect; the President's power to declare scheduled areas is a provision of the Fifth Schedule, not the Sixth Schedule. The Sixth Schedule deals with the administration of tribal areas in four Northeastern states. This question tests the student's knowledge about the constitutional provisions related to the administration of scheduled areas and the roles of the President and Governor in this process.  The incorrect pairing acts as a distractor, demanding detailed knowledge of the Fifth and Sixth Schedules.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties, the organization of village panchayats, and the structure of the Indian Union as a Union of States.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding accurate factual recall and conceptual understanding.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 32 of the Indian Constitution deals with the remedies available for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, making it a crucial provision for their protection.  Article 14 guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, a cornerstone of the Indian legal system. Article 51A outlines the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens, which complement the Fundamental Rights. Part IV of the Constitution encompasses the Directive Principles of State Policy, which aim to guide the state towards social and economic justice. Finally, the Seventh Schedule, a critical component of the Indian Constitution's federal structure, divides legislative powers among the Union, State, and Concurrent Lists.  All the pairs are correctly matched; therefore, option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.

(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UPSC's primary role is conducting recruitment examinations for various civil services and advising the President on appointments. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President.  The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments, ensuring financial accountability. The Attorney General represents the Union Government in the Supreme Court and advises on legal matters. The NHRC investigates human rights violations.  All the given pairs are correctly matched.

(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 17 of the Constitution abolishes untouchability. Articles 25 to 28 guarantee freedom of conscience and the free profession, practice, and propagation of religion.  Article 32 provides the right to constitutional remedies, including the right to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights. Article 21A, added by the 86th Amendment, guarantees the right to education.  Article 300A, added by the 44th Amendment, provides for the right to property as a legal right, not a fundamental right.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The First Schedule lists the states and union territories of India. The Second Schedule specifies the salaries and allowances of various constitutional functionaries, including the President and Governors. The Third Schedule details the forms of oaths and affirmations.  The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha).  The Ninth Schedule originally aimed to protect certain land reform laws from judicial review, though this protection has been significantly curtailed by judicial pronouncements.  All pairs are correctly matched. Other options incorrectly omit some of the correct pairs.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                           Article Number

Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission. Article 323A establishes the National Human Rights Commission. All the pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual recall of constitutional provisions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1858 transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British Crown, establishing the office of the Secretary of State for India to oversee Indian administration.  This Secretary of State was a member of the British Cabinet, responsible to the British Parliament.  This is accurately reflected in pair 1.

The Indian Councils Act of 1861 introduced a limited form of Indian participation in the legislative councils, but did not establish separate electorates. Separate electorates were a feature of the Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms).  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

The Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the legislative councils, but it *did not* grant non-official majorities in provincial legislative councils.  Official majorities were maintained. Thus, pair 3 is incorrect.

The Government of India Act of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms) introduced dyarchy, dividing provincial subjects into transferred and reserved categories.  The transferred subjects were administered by ministers responsible to the provincial legislature, while reserved subjects remained under the Governor's control.  This makes pair 4 correct.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment                                 Significant Impact
1. First Amendment (1951)                               : Introduced the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution
2. Fourth Amendment (1955)                               :  Limited the scope of judicial review of fundamental rights
3. Forty-second Amendment (1976)                          :  Added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution
4. Ninety-ninth Amendment (2014)                         : Established the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The First Amendment Act of 1951 added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, which aimed to protect certain land reform laws from judicial review.  This is correctly matched in pair 1.

The Fourth Amendment Act, 1955, did deal with fundamental rights but it didn't directly limit the scope of judicial review in the way the question implies.  The primary aim was to amend Article 31 to safeguard the right to acquire property for public purposes. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

The Forty-second Amendment Act of 1976 added Fundamental Duties to Part IV-A of the Constitution. This is accurately reflected in pair 3.

The Ninety-ninth Amendment Act of 2014 attempted to establish the NJAC, but this Act was later struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. Thus, pair 4 is incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Powers                                    Nature of Power
1. Appointing the Chief Minister                       : Discretionary Power
2. Dismissing a Chief Minister                         : Discretionary Power
3. Dissolving the State Legislative Assembly           : Discretionary Power  
4. Reserving a state bill for the President's consideration : Discretionary Power

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d) All four

**Explanation:**

While the Governor's actions are generally bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers, the Constitution does grant the Governor certain discretionary powers in specific situations.  These include the appointment of the Chief Minister (when no single party or coalition has a clear majority), the dismissal of a Chief Minister (in cases of loss of confidence or other constitutional violations), dissolving the State Legislative Assembly (under certain circumstances such as prolonged instability), and reserving a state bill for the President's consideration (if it affects matters of national interest).  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. The degree of discretion might vary depending on the specific context, but the power itself exists.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                        Main Purpose
1. The Indian Independence Act, 1947                :  Established the office of Governor-General
2. Government of India Act, 1935                    : Introduced provincial autonomy
3. Indian Councils Act, 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms) :  Introduced dyarchy in provinces
4. Regulating Act, 1773                               : Created the Board of Control

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Independence Act, 1947, paved the way for the independence of India and Pakistan, and while it did eventually lead to the office of Governor-General being created in the interim period, its primary purpose wasn't establishing that office; it was about granting independence.  Therefore, pair 1, while not entirely inaccurate, is a slightly weak match.

The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced significant constitutional reforms, including a federal structure and a substantial degree of provincial autonomy.  This is a strong and accurate match in pair 2.

The Indian Councils Act of 1909 introduced some reforms but not provincial autonomy or dyarchy. Dyarchy was a feature of the Government of India Act of 1919.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.

The Regulating Act of 1773 aimed to improve the governance of the East India Company but did not create the Board of Control. That was created by Pitt's India Act of 1784.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Election                                     Governing Body
1. Lok Sabha Elections                                   : Election Commission of India
2. Presidential Elections                               : Electoral College
3. State Legislative Assembly Elections                 : Election Commission of India
4. Municipal Corporation Elections                      : State Election Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d) All four

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India conducts elections for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.  This is correctly shown in pairs 1 and 3.  Presidential elections in India are conducted by an Electoral College comprising elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies. This is correctly shown in pair 2. Municipal corporation elections are overseen by the respective State Election Commissions, making pair 4 correct.  All four pairs accurately reflect the constitutional arrangements for these various elections.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Body                                      Power Regarding Money Bills
1. Lok Sabha                                             :  Can originate Money Bills
2. Rajya Sabha                                            : Can delay Money Bills for a maximum of 14 days
3. President of India                                     :  Can return Money Bills for reconsideration
4. State Legislative Assemblies                       : Can introduce Money Bills related to state taxes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha has exclusive power to originate Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments to Money Bills but cannot reject or amend them.  The President can return a Money Bill for reconsideration, but the Lok Sabha's decision is final. State Legislative Assemblies can also introduce Money Bills related to state taxes. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Tribe Area                                   Governing Body
1.  Areas under Fifth Schedule                           :  Governor
2. Areas under Sixth Schedule                           :  Governor
3.  Areas under Fifth Schedule                           :  Parliament
4.  Areas under Sixth Schedule                          :  Autonomous District Councils

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Both the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution deal with the administration of Scheduled Areas, but they do so in different ways. The Fifth Schedule provides for the administration of Scheduled Areas in states other than those mentioned in the Sixth Schedule.  While the Governor plays a role in the administration of these areas, the primary responsibility is vested in the state government.  Therefore, pair 1 is partially correct in that the Governor is involved.  Pair 2 is also partially correct, as the Governor has oversight, but direct governance is not always the case.  Pair 3 is inaccurate because while Parliament can make laws for these areas, the primary governance is with the respective states.  Pair 4 is correct as the Sixth Schedule specifically establishes Autonomous District Councils to administer the tribal areas in the four northeastern states.  The councils have significant autonomy.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Power                                    Source of Power
1.  Parliament's power to legislate on State List items:  Concurrent List
2.  State Legislature's power to legislate               : State List
3. Parliament's power to legislate on residual matters:  Residual Powers
4. Governor's power to promulgate ordinances         : Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Parliament's power to legislate on State List items arises during a national emergency or if a resolution is passed by the Lok Sabha for the national interest. It is not derived from the Concurrent List.  Pair 2 is correct as State Legislatures derive their legislative powers from the State List of the Seventh Schedule. Pair 3 is correct, as residual powers, not specifically mentioned in any list, rest with the Parliament. Pair 4 is correct. The Constitution empowers the Governor to promulgate ordinances when the legislature is not in session.

**6. Consider the following pairs:**

     Legal Doctrine                      Supreme Court Application
    1. Doctrine of Severability           :   Used to uphold partial validity of laws
    2. Doctrine of Prospective Overruling :   Applied in cases involving significant constitutional changes
    3. Doctrine of Waiver                 :   Used in cases where a party relinquishes a right
    4. Doctrine of Eclipse                :   Applied when a pre-constitutional law is inconsistent with a constitutional law
    5. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction:   Used to reconcile conflicting provisions within a law or between different laws

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d) All of the above

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Supreme Court extensively uses these legal doctrines in its judgments.

* **Doctrine of Severability:** This doctrine allows courts to strike down only the invalid parts of a law while upholding the remaining valid portions. The Supreme Court frequently employs this to preserve as much of a legislative enactment as possible while ensuring constitutional compliance.

* **Doctrine of Prospective Overruling:** This allows the court to declare a previous judgment incorrect without invalidating the actions taken based on that judgment. This is vital when dealing with significant constitutional changes, allowing for a smooth transition while correcting legal errors. The Supreme Court has used this cautiously, often announcing prospective overruling to provide clarity and avoid chaos in the legal system.

* **Doctrine of Waiver:**  This principle involves a party voluntarily giving up a known right or claim. The Supreme Court considers this in various contexts, including procedural matters, where a party's actions might suggest a waiver of certain rights or objections.

* **Doctrine of Eclipse:** This applies when a pre-constitutional law is inconsistent with a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. The pre-constitutional law is not repealed but is rendered inoperative (eclipsed) to the extent it conflicts with the fundamental right.  The Supreme Court uses this to reconcile older laws with the Constitution's guarantees.

* **Doctrine of Harmonious Construction:** This mandates interpreting multiple laws or conflicting provisions within a single law in a way that harmonizes them, avoiding contradictions. The Supreme Court utilizes this to maintain consistency and coherence within the legal framework.  It avoids rendering laws completely void whenever possible, aiming for a practical and functional legal system.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment          Impact on Supreme Court Jurisdiction
    1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976      :   Curtailed the Supreme Court's power of judicial review
    2. 44th Amendment Act, 1978      :   Reinstated certain powers of judicial review
    3. 99th Constitutional Amendment, 2014 :   Declared the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act unconstitutional

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the impact of the constitutional amendments on the Supreme Court's jurisdiction.

* **42nd Amendment Act, 1976:**  This amendment, enacted during the Emergency, significantly curtailed the Supreme Court's power of judicial review, particularly concerning the fundamental rights and the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution.  The amendment attempted to limit the scope of judicial review, aiming to reduce judicial intervention in legislative and executive actions.

* **44th Amendment Act, 1978:** This amendment, enacted after the Emergency, partially reversed the restrictions imposed by the 42nd Amendment. It reinstated some of the Supreme Court's powers of judicial review, restoring a degree of balance between the judiciary and the legislature.  The 44th Amendment aimed to address the concerns raised about the excessive concentration of power in the executive and legislature.

* **99th Constitutional Amendment, 2014:** This amendment introduced the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), aiming to alter the process of appointing judges to the higher judiciary.  However, the Supreme Court, in a landmark judgment, declared the NJAC Act unconstitutional, thereby reaffirming its role in judicial appointments. This highlights the Supreme Court's power to review and invalidate legislative actions that it deems to violate the Constitution's fundamental principles.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept                     Supreme Court's Role
    1. Fundamental Rights              :   Interpretation and enforcement through Article 32
    2. Directive Principles of State Policy:   Interpretation and guidance for policy formulation
    3. Basic Structure Doctrine          :   Defined and applied to limit the amending power of Parliament
    4. Contempt of Court               :   Power to punish for violations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in all four areas listed.

* **Fundamental Rights:**  The Supreme Court interprets and enforces fundamental rights, primarily through its writ jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution.  It has played a pivotal role in shaping the understanding and application of these rights, protecting citizens from state actions that infringe upon their fundamental rights.

* **Directive Principles of State Policy:** While not directly justiciable, the Supreme Court has interpreted and used the Directive Principles to guide the government in policy formulation.  The court has often emphasized the importance of these principles in achieving social and economic justice, influencing government policies to align with constitutional ideals.

* **Basic Structure Doctrine:** This doctrine, first articulated in the *Kesavananda Bharati* case, limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has defined certain aspects of the Constitution as its "basic structure," which cannot be altered through constitutional amendments. This assertion greatly influences the balance of power between the legislature and judiciary.

* **Contempt of Court:** The Supreme Court has the inherent power to punish individuals or entities for contempt of court, which undermines the dignity and authority of the judiciary. This power is essential to maintain the court's independence and effectiveness.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body              Relationship with Supreme Court
    1. Parliament                   :   Can enlarge the Supreme Court's jurisdiction
    2. President                    :   Appoints judges to the Supreme Court
    3. Council of Ministers          :   Subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court
    4. Union Public Service Commission:   Subject to scrutiny by the Supreme Court regarding its conduct


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately depict the relationship between the named government bodies and the Supreme Court.

* **Parliament:** The Parliament, through legislation, has the power to alter the jurisdiction and structure of the Supreme Court.  This demonstrates the interplay between the legislative and judicial branches.

* **President:**  The President of India, as per the Constitution, plays a significant role in the appointment of Supreme Court judges. This appointment process, though subject to the Supreme Court's scrutiny in certain aspects (collegium system), ultimately involves presidential assent.

* **Council of Ministers:** The actions of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch) are subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.  The court can declare executive actions unconstitutional if they violate the Constitution. This ensures the executive branch adheres to the rule of law.

* **Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):** The Supreme Court can inquire into the UPSC's conduct, particularly if there are allegations of irregularities or violations of constitutional provisions. This oversight is crucial for maintaining the impartiality and integrity of the UPSC, a vital institution for civil service appointments.


**10.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Case                       Key Ruling/Outcome
    1. Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973):  Established the doctrine of basic structure
    2. Minerva Mills Case (1980)     :  Reaffirmed the doctrine of basic structure
    3. Golak Nath Case (1967)       :  Limited Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights
    4. Shankari Prasad Case          :  Upheld Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Three of the pairs are correctly matched.

* **Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973):**  This landmark case established the doctrine of basic structure, which limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  The court ruled that while the Parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental features.

* **Minerva Mills Case (1980):**  This case reaffirmed and further clarified the doctrine of basic structure, reinforcing the limitations on the Parliament's amending power.  The court reiterated the importance of maintaining the essential features of the Constitution, preventing any attempts to alter its core values or principles.

* **Golak Nath Case (1967):**  This case initially limited the Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights.  However, this ruling was later overturned by the 24th Amendment.  The Golak Nath case significantly impacted the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary in constitutional amendment matters.

* **Shankari Prasad Case:**  This case initially upheld Parliament's unfettered power to amend fundamental rights.  This decision was later overturned by the Golak Nath case and subsequently modified by the 24th Amendment.  The Shankari Prasad case illustrates the evolving interpretation of the Constitution.  The initial ruling was later considered to be too broad in its interpretation of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment  |  Impact on Parliament
1. 42nd Amendment           | Increased Lok Sabha seats
2. 44th Amendment           |  Limited President's emergency powers
3. 73rd Amendment           |  Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
4. 74th Amendment           | Established Urban Local Bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Indian Constitution, including increasing the strength of the Lok Sabha.  This directly impacted Parliament's composition and functioning.  Option 2 is incorrect because the 44th Amendment (1978) primarily aimed at restoring balance between the executive and judiciary, limiting the scope of the President's emergency powers, not directly impacting Parliament’s powers. Options 3 and 4 are also incorrect as the 73rd and 74th Amendments (1992) pertained to Panchayati Raj and Urban Local Bodies respectively, establishing these institutions at the local level and not directly altering Parliament's structure or powers.  These amendments did not directly enhance or diminish Parliament's authority. Thus, only statement 1 accurately reflects a direct impact on Parliament resulting from a constitutional amendment.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept             |  Primary Associated Body
1. Judicial Review             |  High Courts
2. Writ Jurisdiction           |  Parliament
3. Fundamental Duties         |  Supreme Court
4. Directive Principles        |  Executive


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Judicial review, the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws and government actions, is primarily associated with High Courts and the Supreme Court.  Option 2 is incorrect as writ jurisdiction, the power to issue writs to enforce fundamental rights, primarily resides with the High Courts and Supreme Court, not Parliament. Option 3 is incorrect; while Parliament enforces Fundamental Duties, the Supreme Court doesn't have a primary role in their enforcement.  Option 4 is incorrect because Directive Principles, while guiding the state's policies, are primarily implemented by the executive branch of government, not the judiciary. Therefore, only the pairing of Judicial Review with the judiciary (High Courts and Supreme Court) is entirely accurate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment |  Specific Provision Affected
1. 42nd Amendment           | Article 368 (Amendment Procedure)
2. 44th Amendment           | Article 352 (National Emergency)
3. 52nd Amendment           | Article 356 (President's Rule)
4. 73rd Amendment           |  Part IX (Panchayats)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment significantly altered Article 368, the article dealing with the amendment procedure of the Constitution. The 44th Amendment modified Article 352, relating to the proclamation of a National Emergency, to limit its scope. The 52nd Amendment introduced the Tenth Schedule, affecting Article 102 and 191, dealing with anti-defection.  The 73rd Amendment added Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats.  Each amendment listed directly affected the specific constitutional provision mentioned in the corresponding pair.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body        |   Primary Area of Responsibility
1. National Investigation Agency (NIA) |  Economic Policy
2. Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) |  National Security
3. Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment |  Public Works Projects
4. Central Law Enforcement Agency |  Minority Institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) is the apex body in India responsible for national security matters. Option 1 is incorrect; the NIA deals with national security, not economic policy.  Option 3 is incorrect; the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment focuses on social welfare and empowerment, not public works projects. Option 4 is incorrect; while a Central Law Enforcement Agency might indirectly relate to minority institutions through law enforcement, its primary focus is broader than just minority institutions. Therefore, only the CCS's responsibility for national security is accurately matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Concept       |  Related Term
1. Democracy              |  Kratia
2. Inclusive Democracy     |  Caste System
3. Representative Democracy |  Universal Adult Franchise
4.  Sovereign State        |  Demos


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The term "democracy" is derived from the Greek words "demos" (people) and "kratia" (rule). Universal adult franchise is a key feature of representative democracy, where citizens elect representatives to govern. Option 2 is incorrect; the caste system is an obstacle to inclusive democracy, not a related term. Option 4 is incorrect; "Demos" relates to democracy, not a sovereign state.  Therefore, only the pairs linking "democracy" with "kratia" and "representative democracy" with "universal adult franchise" are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body        |  Legislative Function
1. Lok Sabha               |  Passes Money Bills
2. Rajya Sabha             |  Introduces Money Bills
3. President                |  Withholds Assent to Bills
4.  State Legislatures     |  Amends the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha, being the lower house, has the primary role in passing Money Bills. The President can withhold assent to bills, effectively vetoing legislation. Option 2 is incorrect; Money Bills are introduced in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. Option 4 is incorrect; the Constitution is amended by Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), not State Legislatures.  Therefore, only the pairs linking Lok Sabha with passing Money Bills and the President with withholding assent are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Document         |  Key Power Granted
1.  42nd Amendment        | Curtailed Supreme Court's Power
2.  Representation of the People Act, 1951 | Allocates Seats in Lok Sabha
3.  Government of India Act, 1935 | Established Indian Federalism
4.  The Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, 2019 | Abolished Article 370


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act curtailed the power of judicial review, indirectly affecting the Supreme Court's power. The Government of India Act, 1935, laid the foundation for the federal structure of India. The 2019 order on Jammu and Kashmir abolished Article 370. Option 2 is incorrect because the Representation of the People Act, 1951, deals with electoral matters, not seat allocation in Lok Sabha; that is determined by the Delimitation Commission and the Constitution itself. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are accurately matched.


**8.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Article           |  Subject Matter
1. Article 14              | Equality before Law
2. Article 17              | Abolition of Untouchability
3. Article 21              | Right to Life and Personal Liberty
4. Article 32              | Right to Constitutional Remedies
5. Article 16              | Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Each of the articles listed accurately corresponds to the subject matter described. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, Article 17 abolishes untouchability, Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, Article 32 provides for the right to constitutional remedies, and Article 16 ensures equality of opportunity in public employment.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

     Schedule               |  Primary Subject Matter
1. Ninth Schedule           |  Land Reforms
2. Tenth Schedule           |  Anti-Defection Law
3. Eleventh Schedule       |  Panchayats
4. Twelfth Schedule        |  Municipalities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Ninth Schedule was initially intended to protect land reform laws from judicial review. The Tenth Schedule deals with the anti-defection law. The Eleventh Schedule lists the powers and responsibilities of Panchayats, and the Twelfth Schedule those of Municipalities.  Each schedule listed accurately corresponds to the subject matter described. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Source of Borrowing    | Constitutional Feature
1. Government of India Act, 1935 |  Directive Principles of State Policy
2. British Constitution     |  Parliamentary System
3. Irish Constitution       |  Method of Election of President
4. Canadian Constitution   |  Vesting of Residuary Powers in the Centre
5. US Constitution         |  Judicial Review


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution borrowed several features from various sources. The parliamentary system was adopted from the British Constitution. The method of electing the President was influenced by the Irish Constitution. The vesting of residuary powers in the Centre was inspired by the Canadian Constitution.  Judicial review was adopted from the US Constitution.  Option 1 is incorrect; the Government of India Act, 1935, provided the framework for federalism and other administrative details, not the Directive Principles of State Policy; those were borrowed from the Irish Constitution. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.

1. Consider the following pairs:

   Government Body                  Action Related to Parliament
1. President                          :   Addresses a joint session of Parliament
2. Prime Minister                     :   Presents the annual budget to Parliament
3. Supreme Court Judge               :   Impeachable by Parliament
4. Comptroller and Auditor General  :   Submits reports to Parliament
5. Union Public Service Commission  :   Jurisdiction can be enlarged by Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India addresses joint sessions of Parliament, a key constitutional function.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is a crucial constitutional body that submits audit reports to Parliament, enabling parliamentary oversight of government finances.  The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is also a constitutional body whose jurisdiction and powers can be modified by Parliament through legislation.

Option (a) is incorrect because while the President and CAG correctly match, the impeachment process for Supreme Court judges involves a complex procedure, with Parliament initiating the process through a resolution, but not directly impeaching. The President plays a key role in this process.

Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairings of the UPSC and the CAG with their respective parliamentary functions.

Option (d) is incorrect because the Prime Minister does not directly present the annual budget to Parliament. It is presented by the Finance Minister, though the Prime Minister leads the government responsible for the budget.  This is a crucial point for UPSC aspirants, highlighting the distinction between the Prime Minister's role as head of government and the Finance Minister's role in budgetary matters.


2. Consider the following pairs:

   Legislative Body                     Power or Function
1. Lok Sabha                           :   Exclusive power to initiate money bills
2. Rajya Sabha                         :   Power to amend the Constitution
3. State Legislative Assembly          :   Power to legislate on subjects in the State List
4. State Legislative Council          :   Power to introduce money bills
5. Parliament                          :   Power to legislate on residuary subjects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha holds the sole power to initiate money bills, a crucial aspect of India's parliamentary system. The Rajya Sabha, while not having the sole power, participates in the constitutional amendment process. State Legislative Assemblies possess the authority to make laws on matters listed in the State List.  Parliament holds the power to legislate on subjects not explicitly mentioned in the Union List or State List (residuary powers).

Option (a) is incorrect because State Legislative Councils do not have the power to introduce money bills; this power is vested solely in the Lok Sabha.

Option (b) is incorrect as it excludes the correct matching of the Rajya Sabha's role in constitutional amendments and Parliament's residuary powers.

Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the important roles of Rajya Sabha and Parliament in constitutional amendments and residuary legislation respectively. These omissions demonstrate a lack of comprehensive understanding of the Indian legislative framework, a crucial area for UPSC exams.



3. Consider the following pairs:

   Constitutional Body                 Responsibility
1. Election Commission of India       :   Appointment of Governors
2. Union Public Service Commission   :   Conducting civil services examinations
3. Finance Commission                  :   Recommending the distribution of tax revenue
4. Comptroller and Auditor General    :   Auditing the accounts of the President
5. National Human Rights Commission :   Investigating human rights violations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The UPSC conducts the civil services examination, a core function. The Finance Commission is responsible for recommending the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States. The NHRC investigates human rights violations, a key mandate.

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of the NHRC.

Option (c) is incorrect because the Election Commission does not appoint Governors; the President does.

Option (d) is incorrect because the CAG audits government accounts, but not those of the President.  The President's accounts are audited separately under the provisions of the Constitution.  This detail highlights the necessity of precise factual knowledge for UPSC preparation.


4. Consider the following pairs:

   Act                                  Provision
1. Government of India Act 1935       :   Established a bicameral legislature at the Centre
2. Indian Independence Act 1947       :   Provided for the formation of Constituent Assemblies
3. Indian Councils Act 1909           :   Introduced separate electorates
4. Government of India Act 1919       :   Introduced dyarchy in provinces
5. Regulating Act of 1773             :   Established a Supreme Court in Bombay


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 established a bicameral legislature at the center. The Indian Independence Act of 1947, leading to India's independence, paved the way for the formation of Constituent Assemblies.  The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced the system of dyarchy in the provinces.


Option (a) is incorrect because while the first three pairings are correct, the Regulating Act of 1773 established the Supreme Court in Calcutta, not Bombay.

Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs the Regulating Act of 1773 with the establishment of a Supreme Court in Bombay.

Option (d) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of the Government of India Act 1935 and the Indian Independence Act 1947.  These omissions would result in significant marks deduction in a UPSC examination setting.


5. Consider the following pairs:

   Amendment Act                       Key Feature
1. 42nd Amendment Act                 :   Introduced Fundamental Duties
2. 44th Amendment Act                 :   Removed the right to property as a Fundamental Right
3. 73rd Amendment Act                 :   Established Panchayati Raj institutions
4. 74th Amendment Act                 :   Established municipalities
5. First Amendment Act                :   Added the word "Socialist" to the Preamble


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act introduced Fundamental Duties into the Constitution.  The 44th Amendment Act removed the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights. The 73rd Amendment Act established Panchayati Raj institutions, and the 74th Amendment Act established urban local governments (municipalities).


Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of the 73rd Amendment Act.

Option (c) is incorrect because the First Amendment Act did not add the word "Socialist" to the Preamble; this was done by the 42nd Amendment Act.

Option (d) is incorrect as it omits the accurate pairing of the 42nd and 44th Amendment Acts.  The ability to identify these amendments and their specific impacts is crucial for success in UPSC examinations.


6.  Consider the following pairs:

    Constitutional Article              Provision
1. Article 356                           :   President's Rule
2. Article 360                           :   Financial Emergency
3. Article 352                           :   National Emergency
4. Article 21                           :   Right to Life
5. Article 32                           :   Right to Constitutional Remedies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 356 deals with the imposition of President's Rule in a state. Article 360 pertains to the declaration of a financial emergency. Article 352 relates to the proclamation of a national emergency.

Option (b) is incorrect because it mistakenly links Article 32 with Article 356's provisions. Article 32 deals with the right to constitutional remedies (enforcement of fundamental rights), while Article 356 deals with President's Rule, a different constitutional provision.

Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly links articles 21 and 32 with other constitutional articles. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, while Article 32 provides for the right to constitutional remedies.  These are distinct concepts.

Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the accurate pairing of Articles 352 and 356.  Omitting these crucial articles displays a lack of thorough knowledge of the Indian Constitution, a key requirement for UPSC success.


7. Consider the following pairs:

    Schedule                                 Subject Matter
1. Fourth Schedule                          :   Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha
2. Fifth Schedule                           :   Administration of Scheduled Areas
3. Sixth Schedule                           :   Administration of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram
4. Seventh Schedule                        :   Distribution of legislative powers between Union and States
5. Eighth Schedule                         :   Recognition of classical languages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Fourth Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha to represent states and union territories.  The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration and control of scheduled areas. The Sixth Schedule addresses the administration of tribal areas in specific states. The Seventh Schedule divides legislative powers between the Union and State governments. The Eighth Schedule lists the officially recognized languages of India.  All these pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the schedules of the Indian Constitution, a crucial topic for UPSC preparation.  There are no incorrect pairings in this question.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Body/Organization             Key Figure/Event
1. Constituent Assembly                 :   Cabinet Mission Plan
2. Drafting Committee                    :   B.R. Ambedkar
3. Interim Government (1946)           :   Jawaharlal Nehru
4.  Constituent Assembly's First Meeting :   December 9, 1946
5.  Objectives Resolution                  :   Adopted by Constituent Assembly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946 laid the groundwork for the formation of the Constituent Assembly.  B.R. Ambedkar chaired the Drafting Committee responsible for drafting the Indian Constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru headed the Interim Government formed in 1946. The Constituent Assembly held its first meeting on December 9, 1946. The Objectives Resolution,  a crucial document outlining the aims and objectives of the Constituent Assembly, was adopted by the Assembly itself.  All five pairs accurately reflect the relationship between the political body/organization and the associated key figure or event.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party/Leader              Action Related to Constituent Assembly
1. Indian National Congress           :   Demanded formation of Constituent Assembly
2. Muslim League                      :   Initially participated but later withdrew
3. Jawaharlal Nehru                    :   Moved the Objectives Resolution
4. Mahatma Gandhi                     :   Directly participated in the Constituent Assembly's deliberations
5.  Jinnah                              :   Boycotted the Constituent Assembly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian National Congress played a pivotal role in demanding the formation of the Constituent Assembly. The Muslim League initially participated but later withdrew its participation due to disagreements over the partition plan. Jawaharlal Nehru, as a key Congress leader, moved the Objectives Resolution that shaped the Constitution's fundamental principles.  Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, famously boycotted the Constituent Assembly.  Option (a) is incorrect as it omits Jinnah's boycott. Option (c) is incorrect because Mahatma Gandhi did not directly participate in the day-to-day workings of the Constituent Assembly, though his influence was substantial. Option (d) is too narrow, omitting significant contributions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Concept/Article       Characteristic/Feature
1. Article 3                             :   Parliament's power to reorganize states
2. Preamble                             :   Source: Objective Resolution
3. Fundamental Rights                   :   Justiciable in courts
4.  42nd Amendment                      :   Added "Socialist" and "Secular"
5.  Basic Structure Doctrine             :   First articulated in Kesavananda Bharati case


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants Parliament the power to alter the boundaries and formation of states. The Preamble of the Indian Constitution draws heavily from the Objective Resolution proposed by Jawaharlal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly. Fundamental Rights, as enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, are justiciable; meaning they can be enforced through the courts. The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution added the words "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble.  The "basic structure doctrine," a crucial concept in constitutional law, preventing the amendment of core constitutional features, was first articulated in the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case.  All five pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                Role in Constituent Assembly/Constitution
1. Dr. Rajendra Prasad                  :   First President of India
2.  H.V.R. Iyengar                       :   Secretary to the Constituent Assembly
3.  Sir B.N. Rau                         :   Constitutional Advisor
4.  G.V. Mavlankar                      :   First Speaker of the Lok Sabha (post-Constitution)
5.  Jawaharlal Nehru                    :   Chaired the Constituent Assembly's drafting committee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected as the first President of India after the Constitution's adoption. H.V.R. Iyengar served as the Secretary to the Constituent Assembly. Sir B.N. Rau acted as the crucial Constitutional Advisor to the Assembly. However,  G.V. Mavlankar was the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha, which is the lower house of the Parliament *after* the Constitution came into effect, not a role within the Constituent Assembly itself.  Jawaharlal Nehru did not chair the drafting committee; that role was filled by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Constituent Assembly, consider the following pairs:**

    Representation Category               Constituency/Group
1.  Provincial Assemblies                 :  Indirect Election
2.  Scheduled Castes                     :   Reserved Seats
3.  Princely States                     :   Initially lacked participation
4.  Muslim League                       :  Withdrew from the Assembly
5.  Congress Party                       :  Dominated the Assembly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Members of the Constituent Assembly were indirectly elected through the Provincial Assemblies, reflecting the existing electoral system under the Government of India Act 1935. Reserved seats were allocated for Scheduled Castes to ensure their representation. Princely states initially hesitated to join the Constituent Assembly, delaying their full integration. The Muslim League, initially a participant, withdrew its membership in protest.  The Congress Party held a significant majority in the Constituent Assembly, influencing its proceedings. All five pairs accurately describe the representation in the Constituent Assembly.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                     Impact on Political System
1. Tenth Schedule                               :   Increased party discipline
2. Anti-defection law                          :   Reduced corruption
3. 91st Amendment Act of 2003                 :   Strengthened political parties
4.  Provision for group defection               :   Weakened parliamentary democracy
5.  Restriction on legislator's right to dissent :   Enhanced government stability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the anti-defection law.  Its primary aim is to prevent legislators from changing parties for personal gain, thereby promoting party discipline and stability within the government.  While it aims to reduce corruption, this is an indirect consequence, not a direct and primary effect.  The 91st Amendment Act of 2003 strengthened the anti-defection law by clarifying some ambiguities and strengthening the powers of the Speaker to deal with defections. The provision allowing group defections, however, weakens the intended effect of the anti-defection law and can lead to instability.  Finally, the restriction on a legislator's right to dissent, while enhancing government stability, can also be seen as a limitation on democratic processes. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 accurately reflect the direct and intended impacts of the mentioned provisions on the Indian political system.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                           Associated Consequence
1. Disqualification under anti-defection law :   Loss of membership in legislative body
2. Anti-defection law                         :   Prevention of political instability
3. Tenth Schedule                             :   Definition of anti-defection
4.  Legislator expulsion                      :   Not explicitly provided in the anti-defection law
5. Exemption from disqualification          :   Provided for specific situations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The anti-defection law, enshrined in the Tenth Schedule, primarily aims to prevent legislators from switching parties, thereby reducing political instability.  Disqualification under this law results in the loss of the legislator's membership in the concerned legislative body. The Tenth Schedule explicitly defines the parameters of the anti-defection law.  The law, however, does not explicitly provide for the expulsion of a legislator; the process is left to the presiding officer's discretion.  Exemptions from disqualification are indeed provided under the law for specific circumstances, such as a merger of parties. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 represent accurate pairings of legal concepts and their associated consequences under the anti-defection law.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Actor                              Effect of Anti-Defection Law
1. Independent Member                         :   Discriminated against
2. Nominated Member                           :   Discriminated against
3. Member of a ruling coalition               :   Protected from disqualification
4.  Member of a major opposition party         :   Subject to disqualification
5.  Party-switching legislator                 :   Potentially faces disqualification

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The anti-defection law primarily targets legislators who switch parties after an election. Independent members and nominated members are often not covered under the purview of the anti-defection law because they do not belong to any political party to begin with. Therefore, they are discriminated against, as the law does not apply to them in the same manner.  A member of a ruling coalition is less likely to face disqualification as the ruling party usually has a majority and can protect its members.  Members of the major opposition parties are as much subject to the anti-defection law as any other member.  A legislator who switches parties after the election can indeed face disqualification under the law. Hence, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 accurately reflect the effects of the anti-defection law on different political actors.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Document                             Content Related to Anti-Defection
1. Tenth Schedule of the Constitution         :   Defines the grounds for disqualification
2. 91st Amendment Act, 2003                 :   Clarified the definition of "split"
3.  The Official Secrets Act, 1923            :   Irrelevant to anti-defection
4.  The Indian Evidence Act, 1872            :   Irrelevant to anti-defection
5.  The Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019          :   Irrelevant to anti-defection


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India explicitly lays down the provisions for the anti-defection law, including grounds for disqualification.  The 91st Amendment Act, 2003, further clarified the definition of a "split" in a political party, a crucial aspect of the anti-defection law. The other acts mentioned (Official Secrets Act, Indian Evidence Act, and Arms Amendment Act) are completely unrelated to the anti-defection law and its legal framework.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 correctly match the legal documents with their content related to anti-defection.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Organization                  Action/Program
1. Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare :  Implementation of the National Food Security Act
2. Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare : Launch of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi
3. Department of Agriculture & Cooperation  : Overseeing the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) network
4. Central Government                        :  Formulation of agricultural policies
5. Ministry of Rural Development             : Implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is a crucial government body responsible for various agricultural initiatives in India. The National Food Security Act and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi are both flagship programs directly under its purview.  The Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, a sub-unit within the Ministry, plays a key role in overseeing the KVKs, which are crucial for disseminating agricultural technologies.  The Central Government, as the apex body, is ultimately responsible for formulating comprehensive agricultural policies. While the Ministry of Rural Development is involved in rural development, including aspects that indirectly affect agriculture (like MGNREGA), its primary focus is not agricultural production or policy. Therefore, only the first four pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   City                                     Characteristic
1. Bengaluru                               :  Headquarters of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
2. Bengaluru                               :  Major centre for the Indian textile industry
3. Moscow                                  :  Home to the Bolshoi Theatre
4. Dubai                                    :  A major global hub for oil and gas trade
5. Moscow                                  :  Location of the Hermitage Museum

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Bengaluru is indeed the home to ISRO headquarters, making the first pair correct.  Moscow is renowned for the Bolshoi Theatre, a world-famous ballet and opera company, making the third pair correct. Dubai's position as a crucial global hub for oil and gas trading is well-established, making the fourth pair correct. However, while Bengaluru has a textile industry, it is not a *major* centre compared to other cities in India. The Hermitage Museum is located in St. Petersburg, Russia, not Moscow.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are accurately matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Award                                   Recipient Category
1. Bharat Ratna                             :  C. Rajagopalachari (Politics)
2. Bharat Ratna                             :  Pandit Bhimsen Joshi (Literature)
3. Padma Vibhushan                          :  Sachin Tendulkar (Sports)
4. Padma Shri                               :  A. R. Rahman (Music)
5. Padma Bhushan                           :  M. S. Subbulakshmi (Music)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

C. Rajagopalachari was indeed a recipient of the Bharat Ratna for his contributions to Indian politics. Sachin Tendulkar received the Padma Vibhushan for his achievements in cricket. A. R. Rahman is a Padma Shri awardee for his contributions to music. M.S. Subbulakshmi received the Padma Bhushan for her contributions to Carnatic music. However, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, while a Bharat Ratna recipient, received it for his contributions to Hindustani classical music, not literature. Thus, only pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Program/Policy            Key Feature/Objective
1. Aadhaar                               :  Unique Identification for every Indian citizen
2. Digital India Programme               :  Promotion of digital literacy and infrastructure
3. National Health Mission (NHM)        :  Focus on improving sanitation and hygiene
4. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan                 :  Elimination of open defecation
5. Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) :  Financial inclusion through bank accounts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Aadhaar's primary goal is to provide a unique identification number to every Indian citizen. The Digital India Programme aims to promote digital literacy and infrastructure development. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan focuses on improving sanitation and eliminating open defecation. PMJDY aims for financial inclusion through bank accounts.  The National Health Mission (NHM) while related to health, does not primarily focus on sanitation and hygiene; those are secondary components. Hence, only pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision             Subject Matter
1. Article 112                              :  Annual Financial Statement (Budget)
2. Article 113                              :  Procedure in Parliament with respect to estimates
3. Article 266                              :  Consolidated Fund of India
4. Article 360                              :  Financial Emergency
5. Article 275(1)                           :  Grants to States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 112 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Annual Financial Statement (Budget). Article 113 outlines the parliamentary procedure concerning budget estimates. Article 266 establishes the Consolidated Fund of India. Article 360 outlines the provisions for a financial emergency.  Article 275(1) discusses grants given to states.  All the pairs provided are correctly matched to their respective constitutional articles.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ideology                                     Core Tenet
1. Gandhism                                  :  Abolition of private property
2. Marxism                                   :  Class struggle
3. Socialism                                 :  Economic equality
4. Capitalism                                :  Free market competition
5. Anarchism                                 :  Stateless society


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Marxism is fundamentally characterized by its emphasis on class struggle. Socialism advocates for economic equality. Capitalism is defined by its free market competition.  However, while Gandhism shares some similarities with socialism and anarchism, the complete abolition of private property wasn't a central tenet of his philosophy; he advocated for trusteeship. Similarly, while anarchism strives for a stateless society, it's not solely defined by that aim. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Provision/Focus
1. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959 : Defines "Office of Profit" explicitly in the Constitution
2. The Government of India Act, 1935          :  Established a bicameral legislature at the centre
3. The Government of India Act, 1919          : Introduced dyarchy in provinces
4. The Indian Independence Act, 1947          :  Provided for the partition of India
5. The Constitution (Seventy-third Amendment) Act, 1992: Deals with the structure of Municipalities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act 1935 indeed established a bicameral legislature at the center. The Government of India Act 1919 introduced the system of dyarchy in the provinces. The Indian Independence Act 1947 formally partitioned India. However, the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, does *not* define "Office of Profit" explicitly within the Constitution; the Constitution leaves the definition open to interpretation and subsequent legislation. The 73rd Amendment Act deals with Panchayats, not municipalities.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Key Provision/Feature
1. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947     :   Regulates the export of antiquities
2. Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878           :   Deals with the discovery of hidden treasure
3. Public Records Act, 1993                      :   Governs the management of public records
4. Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904      :   Protects ancient monuments
5. Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959 :  Defines "Office of Profit"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The question tests the knowledge of various Indian acts related to cultural heritage and governance.  Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947, indeed regulates the export of antiquities from India to prevent the illicit removal of historically significant artifacts. This is a correctly matched pair.

* **Pair 2:** The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878, deals with the legal procedures and ownership rights related to the discovery of hidden treasure.  This is also a correct match.

* **Pair 3:** The Public Records Act, 1993, establishes a framework for the management, preservation, and accessibility of public records. This is correctly matched.

* **Pair 4:** The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, focuses on the protection and preservation of ancient monuments and archaeological sites within India. This is correctly matched.

* **Pair 5:**  The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, aims to prevent disqualification of parliamentarians holding "Offices of Profit," but it *does not define* the term "Office of Profit." The Constitution of India deals with this definition. Therefore, this pair is incorrectly matched.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched Pair 5.  Option (a) correctly identifies only the pairs that accurately reflect the relationship between the act and its primary function.  Understanding the specific functions of each act is crucial for accurate matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                      Subject Matter
1. Article 29                               :   Protection of interests of minorities
2. Article 324                              :   Election Commission
3. Article 370                               :   Special status of Jammu and Kashmir (prior to revocation)
4. Article 275(1)                            :   Grants for Scheduled Areas
5. Article 243(A)                            :   Gram Sabha powers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the understanding of specific articles within the Constitution of India and their corresponding subject matters.  Let's examine each pair:

* **Pair 1:** Article 29 of the Indian Constitution safeguards the rights of minorities to conserve their distinct language, script, or culture.  This is a correctly matched pair.

* **Pair 2:** Article 324 deals with the establishment and powers of the Election Commission of India, which is responsible for conducting free and fair elections. This is a correct match.

* **Pair 3:**  Article 370, prior to its revocation, granted special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. This is a correctly matched pair.

* **Pair 4:** Article 275(1) pertains to the provision of grants by the Union Government to states for raising the level of administration in Scheduled Areas and for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.  This is a correct match.

* **Pair 5:** Article 243(A) deals with the constitution of Gram Sabhas (village assemblies) and their powers and functions at the village level. This is a correct match.

All five pairs are correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.  A thorough understanding of the Constitution's key articles is essential for answering this question correctly.  The ability to accurately link articles with their respective subjects demonstrates a strong grasp of constitutional provisions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                                  Impact on Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha
1. 42nd Amendment Act of 1976                 :   Introduced the concept of "Directive Principles"
2. 44th Amendment Act of 1978                 :   Restored the original six-year term of the Lok Sabha
3. 87th Amendment Act of 2003                 :   Did not alter the seat allocation in the Lok Sabha
4. 58th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1987 :   Increased the number of Rajya Sabha seats
5. First Amendment Act, 1951                 :   Modified Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of various constitutional amendment acts and their impacts on the structure and functioning of the Indian Parliament. Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** The 42nd Amendment Act is known for significant changes, including adding the Fundamental Duties, but it did *not* introduce Directive Principles.  These were already part of the Constitution.  This pair is incorrect.

* **Pair 2:** The 44th Amendment Act, indeed, reversed the six-year term imposed on the Lok Sabha by the 42nd Amendment, restoring it to the original five-year term. This is correctly matched.

* **Pair 3:** The 87th Amendment Act dealt with other matters and did not affect the Lok Sabha's seat allocation. This is correctly matched.

* **Pair 4:** The 58th Amendment Act did not relate to increasing Rajya Sabha seats. This pair is incorrect.

* **Pair 5:** The First Amendment Act primarily aimed at modifying certain Fundamental Rights in response to judicial interpretations.  This is correctly matched.

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (b) is the correct answer. The other options include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of the impact of each amendment act.  This question demands detailed recall of specific amendment acts and their consequences on the parliamentary structure.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Institution            Function/Power
1.  Finance Commission                        :   Recommends principles governing grants-in-aid to states.
2.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)   :   Conducts civil services examinations.
3.  Election Commission of India              :   Decides election schedules for Union Territories.
4.  National Green Tribunal (NGT)             :   Adjudicates disputes related to environmental protection.
5.  Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)     :   Set up during Lal Bahadur Shastri's Prime Ministership

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests the knowledge of various constitutional bodies and their functions. Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** The Finance Commission is indeed responsible for recommending principles governing the distribution of financial resources between the Union and State governments, including grants-in-aid.  This is a correct match.

* **Pair 2:** The UPSC conducts the civil services examinations for recruitment to various central government services. This is correctly matched.

* **Pair 3:** The Election Commission of India decides election schedules for all elections, including those in Union Territories, but it does not solely decide the schedules.  The Union Government plays a role in this.  This pair is incorrect.

* **Pair 4:** The NGT adjudicates environmental disputes, playing a key role in environmental justice and reducing the burden on higher courts. This is correctly matched.

* **Pair 5:** The CAT was established in 1985, not during Lal Bahadur Shastri's tenure as Prime Minister.  This pair is incorrect.

Only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the roles of different constitutional bodies. This question requires specific knowledge about the functions of these bodies and the ability to differentiate between their roles.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Official                   Power/Responsibility
1.  Governor of a State                       :   Appoints the Chief Minister
2.  President of India                         :   Nominates members to Rajya Sabha
3.  Chief Election Commissioner               :   Decides election disputes solely
4.  Attorney General of India                 :   Can vote in the Lok Sabha
5.  Speaker of the Lok Sabha                  :   Holds office during the pleasure of the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

This question examines the powers and responsibilities of various key figures and bodies within the Indian political system.  Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** The Governor of a State does indeed appoint the Chief Minister, based on the majority support in the State Legislative Assembly.  This is correctly matched.

* **Pair 2:** The President of India nominates a certain number of members to the Rajya Sabha. This is correctly matched.

* **Pair 3:** The Chief Election Commissioner heads the Election Commission, which resolves election disputes, but the power is not solely vested in the CEC.  Other Election Commissioners also participate.  This pair is incorrect.

* **Pair 4:** The Attorney General of India can participate in parliamentary proceedings but *cannot* vote. This pair is incorrect.

* **Pair 5:** The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by the Lok Sabha and does not hold office at the pleasure of the President. This pair is incorrect.

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is the correct response. The other options contain incorrectly matched pairs, underlining the importance of precise knowledge of constitutional roles and procedures.  This question demands a nuanced understanding of the distribution of power within the Indian government.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Establishment Year      Tribunal/Commission
1. 1985                      :   National Green Tribunal
2. 1950                      :   Union Public Service Commission
3. 1985                     :    Central Administrative Tribunal
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) traces its origins to the Public Service Commission established in 1926, which was further formalized under the Government of India Act of 1935. While the exact year of establishment may be debated depending on the interpretation of its historical evolution,  the UPSC as a constitutional body was established in 1950,  making option 2 correct. The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) was established in 1985, making option 3 correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established in 2010, not 1985. This makes option 1 incorrect. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall of the establishment years of key Indian governmental bodies.  The distractors play on the timeframe of establishment of similar bodies, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related entities.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister           Significant Event Related to CAT
1. Indira Gandhi             :   Establishment of CAT
2. Jawaharlal Nehru           :   Amendments to CAT jurisdiction
3. Lal Bahadur Shastri       :   Initial proposal for CAT establishment
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Lal Bahadur Shastri's tenure as Prime Minister did not see the *establishment* of the CAT (that occurred in 1985),  the administrative reforms he initiated laid groundwork for the tribunal's eventual creation.  Subsequent Prime Ministers, including Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, oversaw amendments and expansions to the CAT's jurisdiction.  The core of the question lies in understanding the historical context and the evolution of the CAT.  The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of Indian political history and the timeline of administrative reforms.  Options 1 and 2, while not directly incorrect regarding the Prime Ministers' roles in relation to the CAT, are distractors that subtly mislead candidates if they lack precise knowledge of the CAT's establishment date.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution     Provision Related to Mother Tongue Instruction
1. Article 349                    :   Right to Education in Mother Tongue
2. Article 350                    :   Grievance Redressal in Mother Tongue
3. Article 350-A                  :   Mother Tongue Instruction at Primary Level
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 350-A specifically addresses the right of linguistic minorities to receive instruction in their mother tongue at the primary level of education.  Article 349 deals with the special procedure for enacting certain laws related to language, and Article 350 concerns the language to be used in court proceedings and for addressing grievances. The question tests the candidate's understanding of specific articles in the Indian Constitution related to language rights.  The distractors are carefully selected articles that deal with related but distinct aspects of language in India, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between them.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Position Held             Person
1.  Prime Minister of India    :   Govind Ballabh Pant
2.  Home Minister            :   Lal Bahadur Shastri
3.  President of India        :   Swaran Singh
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lal Bahadur Shastri served as the Home Minister of India.  Govind Ballabh Pant held various ministerial positions but not Prime Minister. Swaran Singh served as the External Affairs Minister, not President. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of individuals who held significant positions in the Indian government. The distractors are designed to assess whether the candidate can distinguish between different ministerial portfolios and correctly associate them with the right individuals. The inclusion of plausible distractors, like Govind Ballabh Pant and Swaran Singh, increases the difficulty level.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Principle of Panchsheel    Description
1. Mutual Non-Aggression     :   Respect for each other's internal affairs
2. Peaceful Coexistence       :   Absence of armed conflict
3. Mutual Respect for Sovereignty :   Non-interference in each other's domestic matters
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Peaceful coexistence, a core tenet of Panchsheel, directly implies the absence of armed conflict between nations. Mutual respect for sovereignty inherently involves non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Mutual non-aggression is closely related but not precisely defined as the absence of armed conflict; it’s broader. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the principles of Panchsheel and their interpretations. The distractors subtly alter the meanings of the principles, testing the candidate's ability to grasp the nuances.  The close relationship between the concepts makes it difficult to eliminate incorrect options without a thorough understanding of Panchsheel.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article    Subject Matter
1. Article 350A               :   Language of Courts
2. Article 350                 :   Grievance Redressal in Mother Tongue
3. Article 349                 :   Special Provisions for Linguistic Minorities
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 350 accurately describes the provision for redressal of grievances in the mother tongue.  Article 350A deals with the right to education in the mother tongue, not the language of courts. Article 349 pertains to the special procedure for enacting certain laws relating to language, not directly to the protection of linguistic minorities.  The question focuses on the precise subject matter of specific constitutional articles. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's deep understanding of the constitutional provisions, requiring precise recall and differentiation between closely related concepts.  Incorrect options are plausible due to the interconnectedness of these articles.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commonwealth Feature        Statement
1.  No Charter                  :   All former British territories automatically joined
2.  Voluntary Membership       :   Based on shared history and values
3.  Head of the Commonwealth  :  British Monarch
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth's membership is voluntary, based on shared historical ties and values. The British Monarch serves as the Head of the Commonwealth.  While the Commonwealth lacks a formal constitution,  it's incorrect to say that all former British territories automatically joined. Many territories chose not to join or later left.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Commonwealth's structure and membership.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the Commonwealth's unique nature, requiring differentiation between its fundamental characteristics and common misconceptions.  The plausible, yet incorrect, option 1 increases the difficulty.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body         Power
1. Election Commission        :   Appoints Governors
2. Union Public Service Commission :   Conducts elections
3. Supreme Court               :   Judicial Review
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court of India possesses the power of judicial review, which allows it to examine the constitutionality of laws and government actions. The Election Commission conducts elections, and the UPSC is responsible for recruitment to civil services. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the powers and functions of key constitutional bodies in India. The distractors are carefully crafted to test the candidate's understanding of the distinct roles and responsibilities of these bodies, requiring them to differentiate between closely related functions. The inclusion of plausible distractors enhances the difficulty level.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party       Leader in the First Lok Sabha
1. Swatantra Party          :   S. K. Patil
2. Praja Socialist Party     :   Acharya Narendra Deva
3. Communist Party of India:   A. K. Gopalan
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Acharya Narendra Deva led the Praja Socialist Party, and A. K. Gopalan was a prominent leader of the Communist Party of India in the first Lok Sabha. S.K. Patil was a prominent Congress leader, but not the leader of the Swatantra Party in the first Lok Sabha. The question tests the candidate's understanding of Indian political history and the leadership of various political parties in the first Lok Sabha. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of prominent political figures and their party affiliations during a specific historical period.  The plausible but incorrect option 1 increases the difficulty level.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act          Provision Related to President's Powers
1. 42nd Amendment        :   Absolute Veto
2. 44th Amendment        :   Suspensive Veto
3. 7th Amendment         :   Removal of Governor
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 44th Amendment Act introduced the concept of a suspensive veto for the President of India, allowing him to send a bill back to the Parliament for reconsideration. The 42nd Amendment did not significantly alter the President's veto powers. The 7th Amendment did not deal with the President's powers but with other constitutional matters. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific constitutional amendment acts and their impact on the President's powers. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between different amendment acts and their specific provisions, requiring precise factual recall and understanding of constitutional amendments.  The plausible, yet incorrect, options 1 and 3 increase the difficulty.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article Number       Provision/Right
1. Article 21           : Right to Education
2. Article 23           : Right against exploitation
3. Article 16           : Right to Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment
4. Article 25           : Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion
5. Article 27           : Freedom from payment of taxes for promotion of any religion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 16 of the Indian Constitution guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.  It prohibits discrimination based on factors like religion, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence, etc.  Option 3 accurately reflects this.

Article 27 guarantees freedom from compulsory payment of taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination. This directly aligns with option 5.

Option 1 is incorrect; Article 21, while encompassing the right to life and personal liberty, does not explicitly or solely define the right to education.  The right to education was later added as a fundamental right through a constitutional amendment.

Option 2 is partially correct; Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour. However, it's not solely focused on "exploitation" in the broadest sense.  The article specifically addresses these two forms of human rights violations.

Option 4 is partially correct; Article 25 deals with freedom of conscience and the free profession, practice, and propagation of religion.  However, it is not limited to these aspects but also covers freedom of religious practice.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body       Primary Function
1. Election Commission       :   Decides the election schedule for by-elections only.
2. Union Public Service Commission :   Conducts recruitment for All-India Services only.
3. Central Administrative Tribunal :   Deals with service matters of local authorities only.
4. Finance Commission        :   Recommends the distribution of financial resources between the Centre and States.
5. National Human Rights Commission :   Investigates human rights violations related to the armed forces only.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission's primary function, as enshrined in the Constitution, is to recommend the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States. This is a core aspect of India's fiscal federalism.  Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.

The other pairs are incorrect. The Election Commission decides the schedule for both general and by-elections. The UPSC conducts recruitment for various services, not just All-India Services. The Central Administrative Tribunal deals with service matters related to central government employees, not limited to local authorities.  The National Human Rights Commission investigates a wide range of human rights violations, not just those related to the armed forces.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act       Key Provision/Change
1. 42nd Amendment Act    :   Added "Secular" to the Preamble.
2. 44th Amendment Act    :   Removed Right to Property as a Fundamental Right.
3. 73rd Amendment Act    :   Provided for the establishment of Municipalities.
4. 74th Amendment Act    :   Established the National Green Tribunal.
5. 52nd Amendment Act    :   Added the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Preamble by adding the words "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity," making pair 1 correct.

The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights, making pair 2 correct.  It was subsequently included as a legal right under Article 300-A.

The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 deals with Panchayats, not Municipalities.  Municipalities were addressed by the 74th Amendment Act.  Thus, pair 3 is incorrect.

The National Green Tribunal was established by a separate act of Parliament, not by a constitutional amendment, making pair 4 incorrect.

The 52nd Amendment Act of 1985 introduced the Tenth Schedule, dealing with anti-defection, making pair 5 correct.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure       Significant Contribution/Role
1. Jawaharlal Nehru      :   Initiated the policy of Non-Alignment.
2. Lal Bahadur Shastri    :   Introduced the slogan "Garibi Hatao."
3. Morarji Desai         :   Served as the first non-Congress Prime Minister.
4. Indira Gandhi         :   Nationalized major banks.
5. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel :   Instrumental in the integration of princely states.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru is widely recognized for his role in establishing India's policy of Non-Alignment during the Cold War.  This makes pair 1 correct.

Morarji Desai became the first Prime Minister from a non-Congress party (Janata Party) after the 1977 elections.  Therefore, pair 3 is correct.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a crucial role in integrating the numerous princely states into the Indian Union after independence.  Thus, pair 5 is correct.

Pair 2 is incorrect; Lal Bahadur Shastri did not introduce the slogan "Garibi Hatao" ("Poverty Removal").  This slogan was famously used by Indira Gandhi.

Pair 4 is incorrect; while Indira Gandhi did nationalize banks,  it is not the sole significant contribution that defines her political legacy.  Her contributions are far-reaching and span various policy areas.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article     Subject Matter
1. Article 21                : Right to privacy
2. Article 324              : Election Commission
3. Article 356               : President's Rule
4. Article 370               : Special status of Jammu and Kashmir (prior to 2019)
5. Article 27                : Prohibition of untouchability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 324 of the Constitution deals with the Election Commission of India, outlining its composition, powers, and functions. This makes pair 2 correct.

Article 356 of the Constitution empowers the President to impose President's rule in a state under specific circumstances. This makes pair 3 correct.

Until its revocation in 2019, Article 370 granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.  This makes pair 4 correct.

Pair 1 is incorrect; while the Supreme Court has recognized the right to privacy as inherent in Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty), it's not the sole or primary subject matter of Article 21.

Pair 5 is incorrect; the prohibition of untouchability is addressed in Article 17, not Article 27. Article 27 pertains to freedom from taxes for religious purposes.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                      Position Held
    1. Jawaharlal Nehru           : Governor-General of India
    2. Lal Bahadur Shastri        : President of the Indian National Congress
    3. Morarji Desai              : Minister of Finance, India
    4. Indira Gandhi              : Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only Morarji Desai served as the Minister of Finance in India.  Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India, not the Governor-General (that role was held by Lord Mountbatten). Lal Bahadur Shastri did become Prime Minister, but he never held the position of President of the Indian National Congress. Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister, but not Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.  The other options incorrectly include individuals who held positions unrelated to those listed in the pairings.  The question tests factual recall of key political figures and their roles in the Indian government.  Understanding the distinct roles of Prime Minister and Governor-General is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of India's early political landscape.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Event                                      Prime Minister
    1. Tashkent Agreement                     : Lal Bahadur Shastri
    2. Shimla Agreement                         : Indira Gandhi
    3. Indo-Pak War of 1971                  : Morarji Desai
    4.  Nuclear Doctrine of 'No First Use' adoption : Atal Bihari Vajpayee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the Tashkent Agreement is correctly paired with its Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri.  The Shimla Agreement was signed under Indira Gandhi. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 occurred during Indira Gandhi's tenure, not Morarji Desai's. The adoption of the 'No First Use' nuclear doctrine is associated with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but the exact year of its formal adoption is subject to varying interpretations making it debatable for this question focusing on precise matching. The question tests the ability to link significant historical events with the Prime Ministers who were in office at the time.  Accurate knowledge of these historical pairings is important for demonstrating understanding of India's foreign policy and relations with Pakistan.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article             Subject Matter
    1. Article 344                        : Establishment of the Second Official Language Commission
    2. Article 370                         : Special status of Jammu and Kashmir
    3. Article 371A                        : Special provisions for Nagaland
    4. Article 368                         : Amendment of the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Articles 370 (Jammu and Kashmir), 371A (Nagaland), and 368 (amendment procedure) are accurately paired with their subject matters.  Article 344 deals with the Official Language Commission, but the question specifies the *second* commission, and that's not directly stated by the article number itself. The question assesses understanding of specific constitutional articles and their significance in the Indian constitutional framework.  Knowledge of these articles is critical for evaluating the structure and functioning of the Indian federation and its mechanisms for constitutional change.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                          Role in the Constituent Assembly
    1. K.M. Munshi                    : Chairman of the Drafting Committee
    2. B.R. Ambedkar                  : Member of the Drafting Committee
    3. Jawaharlal Nehru                 :  Secretary of the Constituent Assembly
    4. H.V.R. Iyengar                 : Constitutional Advisor to the Constituent Assembly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only B.R. Ambedkar's role as a member of the Drafting Committee is correctly matched. K.M. Munshi was a member but not the chairman (Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was). Jawaharlal Nehru was a prominent member but not the secretary (H.V.R. Iyengar held that position). Sir B.N. Rau served as the constitutional advisor, not H.V.R. Iyengar. This question tests factual knowledge of key individuals involved in the drafting of the Indian Constitution and their roles within the Constituent Assembly. Accurate recall of these roles is crucial for understanding the process of constitution-making in India.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Date                                    Event in the Constituent Assembly
    1. 22nd July 1947                      : Adoption of the National Flag
    2. 26th November 1949                 : Adoption of the Hindi version of the National Anthem
    3. 24th January 1950                  : Adoption of the Constitution of India
    4. 9th December 1946                  : First Meeting of the Constituent Assembly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The adoption of the National Flag on 22nd July 1947, the adoption of the Constitution on 24th January 1950, and the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly on 9th December 1946 are all accurate. The Hindi version of the national anthem was adopted later than 26th November 1949.  The question tests knowledge of key dates and events related to the Constituent Assembly and the adoption of national symbols.  Precise knowledge of these dates is necessary to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the historical context of the Indian Constitution.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Position/Role
1. Atal Bihari Vajpayee        :  Finance Minister of India
2. Manmohan Singh             :  Governor of the Reserve Bank of India
3. Indira Gandhi               :  Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha
4. Lal Bahadur Shastri         :  President of the Indian National Congress


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each:

1. **Atal Bihari Vajpayee:** While Vajpayee held numerous significant positions, including Prime Minister, he was never the Finance Minister of India.  This is a common misconception, as he held other crucial ministerial portfolios.

2. **Manmohan Singh:**  Manmohan Singh is renowned for his role as Prime Minister and his expertise in economic matters, but he was never the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.  He served as the Finance Minister under P.V. Narasimha Rao, playing a pivotal role in India's economic liberalization.

3. **Indira Gandhi:** Indira Gandhi served as Prime Minister of India and played a dominant role in the Indian National Congress, but she did not lead the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.  The Leader of the Opposition is the head of the largest party in opposition, and Indira Gandhi's Congress party generally held power during her tenure.

4. **Lal Bahadur Shastri:**  Shastri also served as Prime Minister, but he was not the President of the Indian National Congress.  The Congress presidency was held by other prominent figures like Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi during his active political career.


The question intentionally includes plausible but incorrect pairings to test the candidate's precise knowledge of these prominent Indian political figures' careers.  It highlights the importance of accurate factual recall in UPSC-style questions.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister                  Significant Programme/Policy
1. Atal Bihari Vajpayee           :  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)
2. Manmohan Singh                :  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)
3. Indira Gandhi                  :  Green Revolution
4. Lal Bahadur Shastri             :  National Highway Development Programme (NHDP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only the pair concerning Indira Gandhi and the Green Revolution is correctly matched. Let's examine the other pairs:

1. **Atal Bihari Vajpayee and NREGA:** The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), later renamed Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), was primarily associated with the UPA government under Manmohan Singh. While Vajpayee's government implemented various rural development programs, NREGA was not one of them.

2. **Manmohan Singh and PMJDY:** The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) was launched by the NDA government under Narendra Modi.  Manmohan Singh's government implemented several financial inclusion initiatives, but PMJDY was not among them.

3. **Indira Gandhi and the Green Revolution:** The Green Revolution, a significant agricultural advancement in India, saw its initial implementation during Indira Gandhi's tenure as Prime Minister.  Her government's policies played a crucial role in promoting high-yielding variety seeds and modern agricultural techniques.

4. **Lal Bahadur Shastri and NHDP:** The National Highway Development Programme (NHDP) was a major infrastructure initiative launched during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.  While Shastri's government focused on economic development, the NHDP was a later, large-scale project.

The question is designed to test the candidate's understanding of the specific policy initiatives and their association with the respective Prime Ministers.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options emphasizes the need for precise factual recall.




**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person             Major Political Affiliation/Party
1. Atal Bihari Vajpayee:  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
2. Manmohan Singh     :  Indian National Congress (INC)
3. Indira Gandhi       :  Janata Party
4. Lal Bahadur Shastri :  Communist Party of India (CPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only the pairs relating Atal Bihari Vajpayee to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Manmohan Singh to the Indian National Congress (INC) are correctly matched. Let's analyze the other options:

1. **Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP:** Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a prominent leader and served as Prime Minister of India representing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  This is a well-established fact.

2. **Manmohan Singh and INC:** Manmohan Singh was also a Prime Minister of India, and he was a long-standing member and leader within the Indian National Congress (INC).

3. **Indira Gandhi and Janata Party:** This is incorrect. Indira Gandhi was a dominant figure in the Indian National Congress. The Janata Party was formed later, primarily from a coalition of opposition parties, and Indira Gandhi was a key figure in its opposition.

4. **Lal Bahadur Shastri and CPI:** This is also incorrect. Lal Bahadur Shastri was a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, not the Communist Party of India.

The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the major political affiliations of prominent Indian leaders.  The inclusion of plausible distractors (incorrect parties) emphasizes the need for accurate factual knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Election Body / Institution              Key Function/Responsibility
1. Election Commission of India           :  Appointment of Governors
2. President of India                     :  Recognition of National Parties
3. Ministry of Law and Justice             :  Conduct of General Elections
4. Speaker of Lok Sabha                   :  Declaration of Election Results


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only the pair associating the Speaker of the Lok Sabha with the declaration of election results is correctly matched. Let's examine the other options:

1. **Election Commission of India and Appointment of Governors:** The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections, but the appointment of Governors falls under the purview of the President of India.

2. **President of India and Recognition of National Parties:** The recognition of national and state-level political parties is the responsibility of the Election Commission of India, not the President.

3. **Ministry of Law and Justice and Conduct of General Elections:** The conduct of general and other elections is the mandate of the Election Commission of India, an independent constitutional body.  The Ministry of Law and Justice deals with legal matters related to the electoral process but doesn't directly conduct elections.

4. **Speaker of Lok Sabha and Declaration of Election Results:** The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, while not directly involved in the election process itself, officially declares the results of Lok Sabha elections.


The question is designed to test the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various institutions involved in the Indian electoral system. The inclusion of plausible yet incorrect options increases the difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person               Award Received
1. C. Rajagopalachari :  Bharat Ratna
2. Jawaharlal Nehru    :  Param Vir Chakra
3. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel :  Ashoka Chakra
4. Subhas Chandra Bose:  Mahavir Chakra


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of C. Rajagopalachari with the Bharat Ratna award is correct. Let's examine the other options:

1. **C. Rajagopalachari and Bharat Ratna:** C. Rajagopalachari, a prominent freedom fighter and statesman, was indeed awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.

2. **Jawaharlal Nehru and Param Vir Chakra:** The Param Vir Chakra is India's highest military decoration, awarded for conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy.  Jawaharlal Nehru, while a significant figure in India's independence and post-independence era, was not a military figure and thus could not have received this award.

3. **Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Ashoka Chakra:** The Ashoka Chakra is another high military decoration. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, instrumental in India's integration, was not a military person and therefore ineligible for this award.

4. **Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahavir Chakra:**  The Mahavir Chakra is a military decoration.  Subhas Chandra Bose, a key figure in the Indian independence movement, was involved in military operations but this award is not associated with him.

The question tests the candidate's knowledge of high-profile Indian personalities and the awards they received. The inclusion of military awards as distractors for civilian leaders increases the question's difficulty and assesses the candidate's ability to distinguish between different types of awards.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Book Title                     Author
1. 'Gandhian Constitution for Free India' : Aruna Asaf Ali
2. 'Discovery of India'                 :  Achyut Patwardhan
3. 'An Autobiography'                  :  Jawaharlal Nehru
4.  'India Wins Freedom'                 :  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of "An Autobiography" with Jawaharlal Nehru is correct. Let's look at the other options:

1. **'Gandhian Constitution for Free India' and Aruna Asaf Ali:** Aruna Asaf Ali was a prominent freedom fighter, but she did not author this book.  The authorship needs further verification.

2. **'Discovery of India' and Achyut Patwardhan:** Achyut Patwardhan was a noted Indian writer and filmmaker but he is not the author of 'Discovery of India'. Jawaharlal Nehru authored this book.

3. **'An Autobiography' and Jawaharlal Nehru:** Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, is the author of "An Autobiography," a well-known account of his life and political views. This is a widely known fact.

4. **'India Wins Freedom' and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad:** Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement, authored "India Wins Freedom," a significant historical account.

The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Indian authors and their works, specifically within the context of the Indian independence movement and its prominent figures.  The distractors are plausible names of individuals associated with the period, raising the difficulty level.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   District Collector's Powers (as District Magistrate)      Description
1. Maintaining Law and Order                               :  Control over Land Revenue Collection
2. Control over Police                                     :  Issuing Passports to Foreigners
3. Checking Passports of Foreigners                         :  Maintaining Law and Order in the District
4. Control over Land Revenue                              :  Supervision of Local Bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only the pair linking "Checking Passports of Foreigners" with "Maintaining Law and Order in the District"  is partially correct.  This is because while the District Collector does have law and order responsibilities, passport checking is a function that falls under the jurisdiction of immigration authorities. The District Collector might assist in the process but is not primarily responsible for it.


The other pairs are incorrect:

1. Maintaining Law and Order is a responsibility of the District Collector, but it's not directly connected to land revenue collection.  These are distinct administrative functions.

2. Control over Police is a power of the District Collector, but it's not linked to issuing passports.

4. Control over Land Revenue is a function of the District Collector, but it's not directly connected to supervision of local bodies; those are separate administrative functions.

The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the administrative powers of the District Collector within the Indian administrative structure.  The inclusion of partially correct and completely incorrect answers makes it challenging. The focus is on precise understanding of roles and responsibilities.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gallantry Award                    Characteristic
1. Param Vir Chakra                  :  Awarded posthumously only
2. Ashok Chakra                      :  Awarded to civilians only
3. Kirti Chakra                      :  Awarded for acts of bravery in the presence of the enemy
4. Vir Chakra                         :  Awarded for exceptional bravery during peacetime


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only the statement regarding Vir Chakra is fully correct. Let's analyze the others:

1. **Param Vir Chakra and Awarded posthumously only:** The Param Vir Chakra can be awarded to living individuals as well.  Posthumous awards are possible, but not the exclusive case.

2. **Ashok Chakra and Awarded to civilians only:** The Ashok Chakra is awarded for the most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, but it can also be awarded to military personnel.

3. **Kirti Chakra and Awarded for acts of bravery in the presence of the enemy:** While the Kirti Chakra is awarded for bravery, it isn't exclusively for acts in the presence of the enemy.  It encompasses a broader range of situations.

4. **Vir Chakra and Awarded for exceptional bravery during peacetime:**  The Vir Chakra is awarded for acts of gallantry and bravery, including during peacetime.

The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of Indian gallantry awards, their criteria, and the circumstances under which they are conferred.  The distractors use similar-sounding awards and slightly modified descriptions to increase the challenge.  Precise knowledge is crucial to answer accurately.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                     Specific Function/Power
1. Lok Sabha                               :   Nominates members to Rajya Sabha
2. Lok Sabha                               :   Passes the Appropriation Bill
3. Rajya Sabha                             :   Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
4. Lok Sabha                               :  Can initiate a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers
5. Rajya Sabha                             :  Can reject a Money Bill


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in the financial matters of the government.  The Appropriation Bill, which authorizes government spending, must be passed by the Lok Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha can only delay the bill, not reject it.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  A no-confidence motion, a crucial mechanism of parliamentary accountability, can only be initiated in the Lok Sabha, making pair 4 correct.  

Pair 1 is incorrect; the Rajya Sabha does not get its members nominated by the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have separate election processes. Pair 3 is incorrect; while the Rajya Sabha participates in the impeachment process, it is the Lok Sabha that initiates the proceedings. Pair 5 is incorrect; The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill; it can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  The Lok Sabha's ultimate power over money bills is a key feature of the Indian parliamentary system.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Body/Committee          Specific Role/Function
1. Estimates Committee                   :   Scrutinizes the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)
2. Public Accounts Committee              :   Examines the expenditure of the government
3. Committee on Public Undertakings     :   Reviews the working of public sector undertakings
4. Business Advisory Committee           :   Decides the agenda for parliamentary sessions
5. Committee on Petitions                 :   Deals with petitions related to the functioning of the Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) scrutinizes government expenditure, making pair 2 correct. The Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU) examines the performance of public sector enterprises, thus pair 3 is also correct. The Business Advisory Committee (BAC) sets the Lok Sabha's agenda, making pair 4 correct.

Pair 1 is incorrect; The Estimates Committee does not scrutinize CAG reports; the PAC does.  The CAG's reports are independent audits, and the PAC's role is to examine the government's response to those audits. Pair 5 is partially correct, but its function extends beyond just Lok Sabha matters; it also considers petitions related to the entire Parliament.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are completely accurate.


**3. With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Motion/Procedure                 Outcome/Effect
1. No-confidence Motion                  :   Leads to the resignation of the Prime Minister
2. Adjournment Motion                     :   Forces immediate adjournment of the House
3. Censure Motion                         :   Expresses disapproval of the government's actions
4. Cut Motion                              :   Reduces the amount allocated for a specific budgetary item
5. Money Bill                              :   Cannot be amended by the Rajya Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

A successful no-confidence motion necessitates the resignation of the Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers, making pair 1 correct. A censure motion expresses the Lok Sabha's disapproval of government actions, thus pair 3 is correct.  A cut motion reduces the funds for a particular budget item, making pair 4 correct. A money bill, originating in the Lok Sabha, cannot be amended by the Rajya Sabha, making pair 5 correct.

Pair 2 is incorrect; While an adjournment motion aims to halt proceedings, its success depends on various parliamentary procedures and isn't guaranteed.  It doesn't automatically force an immediate adjournment. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are entirely accurate reflections of the Lok Sabha's powers and procedures.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Institution             Key Feature/Power
1. Election Commission                    :   Conducts elections to the Lok Sabha
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) :   Appointed by the President
3. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):   Conducts recruitment for All-India Services
4. Finance Commission                      :   Recommends distribution of financial resources between the Union and States
5. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):  Appoints members to the Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission conducts Lok Sabha elections, making pair 1 correct. The CAG is appointed by the President, making pair 2 correct. The UPSC recruits for All-India Services, making pair 3 correct. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of financial resources, making pair 4 correct.

Pair 5 is incorrect; the NCSC does not appoint Lok Sabha members.  The Lok Sabha's members are elected by the people or nominated by the President (in limited cases, like Anglo-Indian representation). Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article of the Indian Constitution       Subject Matter
1. Article 356                               :   Suspension of Fundamental Rights during Emergency
2. Article 243G                              :   Constitution of District Planning Committees
3. Article 352                               :   Proclamation of National Emergency
4. Article 360                               :   Financial Emergency
5. Article 370                               :   Special status of Jammu and Kashmir


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 243G deals with the constitution of District Planning Committees, making pair 2 correct. Article 352 relates to the proclamation of a National Emergency, making pair 3 correct. Article 360 concerns Financial Emergencies, making pair 4 correct.

Pair 1 is incorrect; Article 356 deals with the President's Rule in states, not the suspension of Fundamental Rights during an emergency.  That is covered under Article 358 and 359.  Pair 5 is incorrect; Article 370 dealt with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which has since been revoked. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Association/Position
1. J.B. Kripalani              :   President, Indian National Congress
2. Jay Prakash Narayan         :   Leader of the Socialist Party
3. Acharya Narendra Dev       :   Founder of the Forward Bloc
4. Vinoba Bhave                :   Prominent leader of the Quit India Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

J.B. Kripalani served as the President of the Indian National Congress, a significant position within the Indian independence movement.  Jay Prakash Narayan was a prominent leader associated with the Socialist Party in India, actively involved in shaping its ideology and political activities.  Acharya Narendra Dev was not the founder of the Forward Bloc; that distinction belongs to Subhas Chandra Bose. Vinoba Bhave, while involved in the Quit India Movement, wasn't a prominent leader in the same way as others like Mahatma Gandhi or Sardar Patel.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes Kripalani's correct association. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect association of Acharya Narendra Dev with the Forward Bloc. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect associations of both Acharya Narendra Dev and Vinoba Bhave.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept             Impacting Factor
1. Human Rights              :   Impact of Globalisation
2. Human Rights              :   Influence of Technological Advancement
3. Human Rights              :   Impact of Climate Change

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Globalization significantly impacts human rights through the spread of ideas, increased interconnectedness, and the influence of international organizations and treaties.  Technological advancements, such as surveillance technologies and the spread of misinformation, can both positively and negatively influence human rights. Climate change poses a significant threat to human rights, particularly the right to life, health, and adequate living standards, as it leads to displacement, resource scarcity, and increased vulnerability to natural disasters.  All three pairs accurately reflect factors that impact human rights.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not encompass the full range of factors influencing human rights.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure             Significant Ideology/Concept
1. Jay Prakash Narayan       :   Partyless Democracy
2. J.B. Kripalani            :   Sarvodaya Movement
3. Acharya Narendra Dev      :   Gandhian Socialism

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Jayaprakash Narayan championed various social and political reforms, he is not primarily associated with the concept of partyless democracy although he advocated for it. J.B. Kripalani's association with the Sarvodaya movement is not his primary ideological focus.  Acharya Narendra Dev was a prominent figure in the socialist movement within India and is accurately linked to Gandhian Socialism. Hence, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the incorrect association of Jayaprakash Narayan with Partyless Democracy. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes both the incorrect association of Jayaprakash Narayan and the weak association of J.B. Kripalani. Option (d) is incorrect because it also includes the incorrect association of Jayaprakash Narayan.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                          Description
1. Social Equality                 :   Equal opportunity regardless of social background
2. Political Equality                :   Equal access to the political process
3. Economic Equality               :   Equal distribution of wealth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Social equality emphasizes equal opportunities for all individuals regardless of their social origins, caste, race, or gender.  Political equality refers to the equal right of all citizens to participate in the political process, including voting, running for office, and having their voices heard. Economic equality, while a debated ideal, generally refers to a fairer distribution of wealth and resources across society.  All three pairs correctly define the respective concepts.  Therefore, option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not represent the complete picture of the meanings of the concepts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Rights              Example
1. Political Rights            :   Right to Information
2. Civil Liberties             :   Right to Freedom of Speech
3. Economic Rights            :   Right to Education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Political rights encompass the rights related to participation in the political process, including the right to vote, contest elections, and access information relevant to governance. The Right to Information directly falls under this category. Civil liberties are fundamental freedoms protected by law, such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly.  Economic rights pertain to the right to an adequate standard of living, including access to resources like education, healthcare, and employment. The right to education is a crucial economic right.  All three pairs accurately match the type of right with its relevant example.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not include the full range of correctly matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Covenant          Adopting/Establishing Body
1. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights : World Health Organization
2. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights :  International Labour Organization
3. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) :  United Nations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was indeed established by the United Nations.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights were both adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, not the World Health Organization or the International Labour Organization.  The WHO focuses on public health, and the ILO on labor standards, neither of which are the primary bodies responsible for international human rights covenants. This question tests factual recall of the organizations responsible for key international legal instruments.  Understanding the roles of these different international bodies is crucial for comprehending the global governance landscape and the interplay between international law and various specialized agencies.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect organizations in options (a) and (b) serves as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge and ability to differentiate between international organizations with related but distinct mandates.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Data/Information Related To
1. Brundtland Commission                  :  Sustainable Development Goals
2. Parliamentary Forum on Millennium Development Goals :  Agenda 21
3. United Nations                          : International migration reports

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations does indeed report on international migration.  The other two pairs are incorrectly matched. The Brundtland Commission's main focus was on sustainable development, which led to the concept of sustainable development,  but it did not directly create or adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The SDGs were adopted later by the UN.  Similarly, the Parliamentary Forum on Millennium Development Goals collected data from the UN, but it did not directly relate to Agenda 21, which was a UN document on sustainable development. This question tests the candidate's ability to connect organizations with specific data or information they handle. The question uses plausible but incorrect pairings to increase the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge of the organizations and their activities.  A strong understanding of the relationship between international organizations and the data they generate is vital for policy analysis and international relations.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                 Relationship with the United Nations
1. Kosovo                                  :  Full membership
2. India                                   :  Observer status
3.  Punjab (as a GPE)                     :  Recognition as a sovereign state

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Kosovo's relationship with the UN is complex and it does not hold full membership. India is a full member of the United Nations, not an observer. Punjab, being a state within India, is not recognized as a sovereign state by the United Nations. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the diverse relationships countries can have with the UN, beyond simple membership.  The incorrect options serve as strong distractors, highlighting the complexities of international relations and the need for precise knowledge of each country's status within the UN system.  The inclusion of a sub-national entity (Punjab) further complicates the question, demanding a thorough understanding of the UN's structure and the principles of statehood.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution        Subject Matter
1. Article 29                               : Right to establish and administer educational institutions
2. Article 30                               : Protection of interests of minorities
3. Article 350A                            : Right of Sikhs to carry Kirpans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 29 of the Indian Constitution deals with the protection of the interests of minorities, specifically those with distinct languages, scripts, or cultures.  Article 30 addresses the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.  Article 350A relates to the provision of facilities for instruction in the mother tongue at the primary stage of education, not the right of Sikhs to carry Kirpans (that's covered elsewhere in the constitution).  The question tests detailed knowledge of specific articles and their subject matter within the Indian Constitution.  The incorrect options are carefully designed distractors, testing the candidate's ability to accurately differentiate between closely related constitutional provisions.  A clear understanding of these articles is essential for anyone analyzing Indian constitutional law and the rights of minorities.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee on Electoral Reforms       Submitted Report Year
1. Dinesh Goswami Committee           :   1990
2. Tarkunde Committee                   :   1975
3. Indrajit Gupta Committee             :   2004


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** While the Dinesh Goswami Committee, Tarkunde Committee, and Indrajit Gupta Committee all submitted reports on electoral reforms, none of the years provided in the options are accurate.  The actual years of submission differ. This question tests the examinee's knowledge of significant committees and their timelines, emphasizing the importance of precise recall in historical context.  The incorrect options, while plausible, are designed to highlight the importance of accurate factual knowledge over general awareness.  The ability to recall specific years of reports from committees related to significant policy changes is a key skill for UPSC aspirants.  A detailed understanding of electoral reforms in India requires knowledge of these committees and their specific recommendations.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                      Year of Enactment
1. Minimum Wages Act                      :   1936
2. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act :   1949
3. Indian Treasure and Trove Act           :   1878


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Indian Treasure and Trove Act was indeed enacted in 1878.  The other two pairs are incorrect. The Minimum Wages Act was enacted in 1948, not 1936. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act was enacted in 1947, not 1949. This question tests factual recall of important legislation and their years of enactment.  The incorrect options provide plausible but inaccurate years, emphasizing the importance of precise knowledge.  Understanding the historical context of these acts and their impact on various aspects of Indian society is crucial for UPSC preparation.  The inclusion of closely related years as distractors increases the question's difficulty.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry                                    Department/Authority
1. Ministry of Defence                       :  Indo-Tibetan Border Police
2. Ministry of Home Affairs                  :  National Disaster Management Authority
3. Ministry of Home Affairs                  :  National Security Guard


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The National Disaster Management Authority and the National Security Guard are both under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of Defence.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the organizational structure of the Indian government and the ministries responsible for various agencies.  The inclusion of a plausible but incorrect pairing (Ministry of Defence and Indo-Tibetan Border Police) serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge.  A sound understanding of the Indian administrative system is crucial for UPSC examination.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Theory                                    Proponent
1. Legal Positivism                             :  T.H. Green
2.  Social Contract Theory                       :  John Austin
3. Natural Law Theory                            : Thomas Hobbes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  None of the pairings are correct.  While all three theories (Legal Positivism, Social Contract Theory, and Natural Law Theory) are significant in jurisprudence, the proponents listed are not accurately paired.  Legal Positivism is primarily associated with thinkers like John Austin and Jeremy Bentham, not T.H. Green.  Social Contract Theory is associated with Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, not John Austin, who is a key figure in legal positivism.  Thomas Hobbes, while influential in political philosophy, isn't the primary proponent of Natural Law Theory; that's typically associated with figures like Aquinas and Cicero. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of major legal and political theories and their key proponents.  The incorrect options use names of prominent thinkers in related fields, increasing the question's difficulty and requiring precise knowledge of each theory's origins and development. A thorough understanding of these theories is essential for analyzing legal and political systems.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Thinker                                    Quote Related To Democracy
1. John Locke                               :  "Government by Consent"
2. J.S. Mill                                 :  "Tyranny of the Majority"
3. Jeremy Bentham                           :  "Utilitarianism"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** J.S. Mill is accurately associated with the concept of "Tyranny of the Majority," a potential drawback of democratic systems.  The other pairs are incorrect. While John Locke is a significant figure in the development of liberal thought and ideas about consent, the specific quote "Government by Consent" isn't directly attributable to him in the same way the "Tyranny of the Majority" is to Mill.  Jeremy Bentham's main contribution is utilitarianism, a moral philosophy, not a specific quote about democracy. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of political philosophy and the ideas of key thinkers related to democracy.  The incorrect options include concepts closely related to the thinkers' works but not directly linked to the specific quote, making it challenging for candidates to identify the correct answer without precise knowledge.  Understanding the nuances of different political theories is important for UPSC preparation.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article                     Provision Related To
1. Article 32                               : Right to Education
2. Article 21-A                             : Right to Constitutional Remedies
3. Article 350A                            : Facilities for instruction in mother-tongue at primary stage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Article 350A correctly relates to the provision of facilities for instruction in the mother tongue at the primary stage of education. The other two pairings are incorrect. Article 32 deals with the right to constitutional remedies, specifically for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Article 21-A guarantees the right to education, but it is not the primary focus of Article 32. The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of specific constitutional articles and their related provisions.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, ensuring that only candidates with precise knowledge can answer correctly.  A thorough understanding of the Indian Constitution's provisions is crucial for UPSC aspirants.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment  |  Significant Change Related to the Lok Sabha
1. 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 |  Introduced the words "Socialist" and "Secular" in the Preamble
2. 84th Amendment Act, 2001 |  Extended the term of the Lok Sabha during a National Emergency
3. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992 |  Related to Panchayati Raj Institutions, not directly to Lok Sabha structure
4. 44th Amendment Act, 1978 |  Restored the original six-year term of the Lok Sabha
5. First Amendment Act, 1951 | Introduced the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, not directly impacting Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Preamble to the Indian Constitution, adding the words "Socialist" and "Secular," reflecting the evolving political and social landscape of the nation.  While not directly impacting the Lok Sabha's structure, it contextualizes the broader ideological shift influencing parliamentary functioning. The 84th Amendment Act, 2001, is crucial for understanding the Lok Sabha's potential term extension during times of national emergency. This amendment addresses the exceptional circumstances where the normal five-year term might be extended to maintain stability and continuity.  The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 reversed a previous change, restoring the Lok Sabha's term to its original six-year duration. This highlights the dynamic nature of the Constitution and the ongoing adjustments to its provisions. The 73rd Amendment, while landmark legislation concerning Panchayati Raj Institutions, doesn't directly involve the Lok Sabha's composition or function.  The First Amendment Act of 1951 primarily introduced the Ninth Schedule, meant to protect certain laws from judicial review, and its influence on Lok Sabha is indirect and not a primary focus. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect constitutional amendments that directly or significantly impacted the Lok Sabha.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution |  Provision Related to the Lok Sabha
1. Article 112                      |  Deals with the Annual Financial Statement (Budget) presented to Parliament, indirectly impacting Lok Sabha's role in approving the budget.
2. Article 324                      |  Establishes the Election Commission of India, responsible for conducting Lok Sabha elections.
3. Article 81                       |  Specifies the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha to states and union territories.
4. Article 356                      |  Deals with the President's Rule in states, not directly related to the Lok Sabha's internal functioning.
5. Article 78                       |  Relates to the President's duties regarding the Council of Ministers and not the Lok Sabha's functions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 112 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Union Budget, a crucial aspect of the Lok Sabha's financial powers. The Lok Sabha's role in scrutinizing, debating, and approving the budget is pivotal to its legislative and financial authority. Article 324 establishes the Election Commission of India (ECI), the independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections, including Lok Sabha elections.  The ECI's role is fundamental to the democratic functioning of the Lok Sabha. Article 81 outlines the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha, representing the states and union territories. This article is directly related to the Lok Sabha's composition and representation. Articles 356 and 78, however, are not directly connected to the Lok Sabha's internal workings. Article 356 pertains to the President's power to impose President's Rule in a state, while Article 78 relates to the President's duties regarding the Council of Ministers.  These articles are related to broader governance aspects but not the specific functioning of the Lok Sabha. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate a direct and crucial link between specific constitutional articles and the Lok Sabha's functions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Function                      |  Constitutional Basis
1. Impeachment of the President           |  Article 61, detailing the process which involves both houses of Parliament, including the Lok Sabha.
2. Passing of Money Bills                 |  Article 110, defining Money Bills and giving the Lok Sabha a predominant role.
3. Approving the Proclamation of Emergency |  Article 352, where the Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in approving or disapproving the proclamation.
4. Election of the Speaker                |  Article 93, outlining the election procedure of the Speaker, done by the Lok Sabha members themselves.
5.  Amendment of the Constitution       | Article 368, the process involves both houses of Parliament, not exclusively the Lok Sabha.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha's role in the impeachment of the President, as defined in Article 61, is a significant power of the lower house. The process requires a majority vote in both houses, but the Lok Sabha's initiation and participation are vital. Article 110 specifically addresses Money Bills, giving the Lok Sabha the primary role in their passage. This reflects the Lok Sabha's control over financial matters. Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency, and the Lok Sabha's approval or disapproval is constitutionally mandated. The Lok Sabha's role in this process is crucial for maintaining the balance of power. Article 93 clearly outlines that the Lok Sabha elects its Speaker, a pivotal figure in the House's proceedings.  However, Article 368, concerning constitutional amendments, involves both houses of Parliament; the Lok Sabha doesn't have exclusive power in this process.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 correctly match Lok Sabha functions with their specific constitutional provisions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Committee                   |  Primary Function
1. Committee on Public Accounts         |  Examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)
2. Estimates Committee                  |  Examines the estimates included in the budget
3. Committee on Subordinate Legislation | Scrutinizes the powers delegated to the executive by Parliament to make regulations, rules, etc.
4. Business Advisory Committee          |  Advises the Speaker on the allocation of time for parliamentary business
5. Committee on Privileges               |  Enforces the rules of conduct and privileges of the Lok Sabha members.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the primary functions of the respective Lok Sabha committees. The Committee on Public Accounts examines the CAG's reports, ensuring government accountability in financial matters. The Estimates Committee scrutinizes budget estimates, promoting efficiency and effective resource allocation. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines delegated legislation, upholding the principle of parliamentary oversight. The Business Advisory Committee assists the Speaker in managing the legislative agenda, ensuring smooth parliamentary functioning. Finally, the Committee on Privileges safeguards the dignity and decorum of the Lok Sabha, maintaining its authority and integrity.  Each committee plays a distinct yet crucial role in the functioning of the Lok Sabha, contributing to its overall effectiveness and accountability.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Motion in Lok Sabha          |  Purpose
1. Adjournment Motion                   |  To discuss a matter of urgent public importance, potentially leading to a debate and government response.
2. No-Confidence Motion                 | To express a lack of confidence in the Council of Ministers, potentially leading to the government's resignation.
3. Censure Motion                       |  To express disapproval of the government's actions or policies, without necessarily leading to the government's resignation.
4. Cut Motion                           |  To reduce the amount of money allocated for a specific item in the budget
5.  Private Member's Bill                 |  A bill introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) All five
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) All five

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately describes the purpose of the corresponding motion or bill within the Lok Sabha.  An adjournment motion is used to bring attention to urgent matters, demanding immediate government attention. A no-confidence motion directly challenges the government's legitimacy, potentially leading to its downfall. A censure motion expresses disapproval, while not necessarily forcing a resignation.  A cut motion allows for reducing budgetary allocations, furthering financial oversight. Finally, a private member's bill is a legislative proposal initiated by a non-ministerial MP, showcasing citizen participation in lawmaking.  All five pairs correctly link the parliamentary procedures with their intended functions and roles within the Lok Sabha's legislative process. There are no inaccuracies in any of the provided pairs.

1. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Specific Function/Responsibility
1. Ministry of Finance              :   Oversees the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM)
2. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)      :   Prepares the Union Budget
3. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) :   Supervises State Governments in disaster management
4. Goods and Services Tax Council  :   Advises the President on matters related to elections
5. Election Commission of India     :   Publishes the Annual Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Finance in India does indeed oversee the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is responsible for the privatization and disinvestment of public sector undertakings.  The NDMA's crucial role includes supervising and coordinating the efforts of state governments in disaster preparedness, response, and mitigation. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is constitutionally mandated to conduct free and fair elections and publishes annual reports detailing its activities.

Option (c) is incorrect because the RBI does not prepare the Union Budget; that is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.  The GST Council advises the central government on GST-related matters, not the President on elections. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies mentioned above.  Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete, omitting the accurate pairing of the ECI with its function.


2. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                 Legislative Power/Responsibility
1. Parliament of India              :   Grants recognition to national political parties
2. State Election Commission        :   Establishes new states
3. Election Commission of India     :   Prepares electoral rolls for parliamentary constituencies
4. Ministry of Home Affairs         :   Conducts elections for state legislative assemblies
5. Rajya Sabha                     :   Can amend Articles related to Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Parliament of India, through legislation, can grant recognition to national political parties based on criteria set by the Election Commission.  The Election Commission of India is responsible for the preparation of electoral rolls for all elections, including those for Parliament. The Rajya Sabha, being part of Parliament, participates in the amendment process, which includes articles related to Fundamental Rights.

Options (a) and (b) are partially correct but incomplete. The State Election Commission does not have the power to establish new states; that power rests with the Parliament. The Ministry of Home Affairs does not conduct elections; that is the responsibility of the Election Commission. Option (d) is incorrect due to these inaccuracies.


3. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Right/Concept              Associated Act/Legislation
1. Copyright                         :   The Trade Marks Act, 1999
2. Patent                            :   The Copyright Act, 1957
3. Trademark                         :   The Patents Act
4. Industrial Design                 :  Disaster Management (Annual Report of National Authority) Rules, 2006
5. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) : Government of India Act, 1935


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Copyright is protected under the Copyright Act, 1957; patents are governed by the Patents Act; trademarks fall under the Trade Marks Act, 1999; and industrial design has its own specific legislation. The Disaster Management Rules and the Government of India Act are not directly related to the listed intellectual property rights.  This question highlights the need for precise knowledge of relevant legislation in relation to specific legal concepts.


4.  **Consider the following pairs:**

    Act                                     Key Characteristic/Consequence
1. Indian Independence Act, 1947       :   Repealed the Government of India Act, 1919
2. Government of India Act, 1935       :   Established provincial autonomy
3. Government of India Act, 1919       :   Introduced dyarchy
4. Abolition of Privy Council Jurisdiction Act, 1949 :  Established the Federal Court
5. The Disaster Management Act, 2005 : Established the National Disaster Management Authority


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian Independence Act, 1947, indeed led to the end of British rule and the repeal of the 1919 Act. The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced significant constitutional reforms including provincial autonomy. The Government of India Act, 1919, is known for its introduction of dyarchy (dual governance) in the provinces.  The Abolition of Privy Council Jurisdiction Act, 1949, did not establish the Federal Court; that was a feature of the Government of India Act, 1935.  The Disaster Management Act established the NDMA, but this is not directly tied to the other acts in the list.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, demonstrating the candidate's understanding of key historical legislative acts and their impacts.


5. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Institution      Specific Power/Function
1. Supreme Court of India              :   Conducts elections for the President of India
2. Election Commission of India       :   Appoints District Judges
3. Parliament of India                 :   Determines the emoluments of the Supreme Court Judges
4. Finance Commission                  :   Supervises the functioning of the State Election Commissions
5. National Disaster Management Authority:  Prepares the Union Budget


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Parliament of India has the constitutional power to determine the salaries and allowances of Supreme Court judges.  The other options are incorrect.  The Election Commission of India conducts presidential elections; it does not appoint District Judges (that's the responsibility of the High Courts). The Supreme Court does not conduct elections; it hears election-related disputes. The Finance Commission makes recommendations on fiscal matters, it doesn't supervise State Election Commissions. The NDMA is responsible for disaster management, not budget preparation. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the roles and powers of different constitutional bodies.



6.  **Consider the following pairs:**

     Political Party Status           Number of States Required
1. National Party                   :  At least five states
2. State Party                      :  At least two states
3. Recognised Political Party       :  At least three states
4. Registered Political Party       : At least one state


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

To be recognized as a national party in India, a political party must meet certain criteria, including being recognized as a state party in at least four states, not five.  However, the question uses plausible distractors making it difficult to guess the answer.  To be a state party, a party needs recognition in at least four states.  A registered political party only requires registration with the Election Commission.  This question tests factual knowledge about the recognition of political parties in India.


7. **Consider the following pairs:**

   International Human Rights Treaty    Governing Body/Organization
1. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights :   World Health Organization
2. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women:  United Nations
3. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: International Labour Organization
4. Declaration on the Right to Development: World Trade Organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only


**Explanation:**

Only the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is correctly paired with the United Nations as its governing body. The other options incorrectly match the treaties with international organizations. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a treaty adopted by the United Nations, not the World Health Organization. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is also a UN treaty, not an ILO treaty. The Declaration on the Right to Development is a UN declaration, not a World Trade Organization document.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international human rights instruments and their associated organizations.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's deep understanding of the subject.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires precise factual knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure          Advocated/Associated with Parliamentary System
1. Mahatma Gandhi           :   Strong supporter of the system
2. B.R. Ambedkar            :   Championed the system for its accountability
3. K.M. Munshi              :   Argued for its adoption based on existing experience
4. H.J. Laski                :   Criticized it for potential tyranny


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

B.R. Ambedkar and K.M. Munshi were strong advocates for adopting the parliamentary system in India. Ambedkar emphasized its responsibility and accountability features, while Munshi highlighted the existing experience with the system during British rule.  H.J. Laski, while not directly involved in the Indian context, is known for his critiques of the parliamentary system's potential for abuse of power.  Gandhi's stance on the parliamentary system is more complex and not definitively characterized as strong support in the provided knowledge base.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent Gandhi's position and/or omit Laski's critical perspective.  Option (c) accurately reflects the positions of Ambedkar, Munshi, and Laski's critical view, making it the correct answer.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body          Key Characteristic/Role in Parliamentary System
1. Council of Ministers     :   Foundation of the system
2. Legislature              :   Combines with the Executive
3. Cabinet                  :   Characterized by powerful influence
4. Executive                :   Operates under the system's framework
5. Governor                 :   Appointment of Chief Minister influenced by the system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Council of Ministers forms the core executive in a parliamentary system. The Legislature and Executive are intertwined, with the Legislature holding the Executive accountable. The Cabinet wields significant power, influencing policy and decision-making. The Executive operates within the framework of the parliamentary system. Finally, the Governor's role in appointing the Chief Minister is influenced by the dynamics of the parliamentary system.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, missing key relationships. Option (c) is the only option that includes all correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Indian Federal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Feature       Source/Origin
1. Federal System               :   Nehru Report
2. Union of States              :   Article 1 of the Indian Constitution
3. Parliamentary Sovereignty  :   British Parliament's legacy
4.  Judicial Review              :   Inherent power of the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Nehru Report proposed a federal structure for India, although the final Constitution differed in specifics. Article 1 explicitly defines India as a "Union of States."  The concept of Parliamentary sovereignty, while adopted from the British model, is significantly tempered in India due to the Supreme Court's judicial review power and the written Constitution.  The Supreme Court's power of judicial review is a cornerstone of the Indian system, derived from the Constitution's structure and interpretation.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, and only option (d) correctly matches all pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body         Power/Function related to Article 356
1. Parliament                 :   Can exercise powers of the State Legislature under Article 356
2. President                  :   Exercises power under Article 356
3. State Assembly              :   Automatically dissolved upon President's Rule under Article 356
4. Supreme Court              :  Judicial review of President's action under Article 356

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Parliament's power to legislate for a state under Article 356 (President's Rule) is a key feature. The President is the one who actually invokes Article 356. The Supreme Court's power of judicial review allows it to examine the constitutionality of actions taken under Article 356. However, the State Assembly's automatic dissolution is not a guaranteed consequence of Article 356; it's a common practice but not constitutionally mandated.  Option (b) correctly identifies the constitutionally mandated powers related to Article 356, while option (d) incorrectly includes the automatic dissolution of the State Assembly. Options (a) and (c) are also incomplete.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Committee        Focus Area
1. Rajamannar Committee       :   Governor's appointment
2. Sarkaria Commission         :   Centre-State relations
3. First Administrative Reforms Commission:   Governor's role as detached figure
4. National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution:   Federal System


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sarkaria Commission extensively examined Centre-State relations. The First Administrative Reforms Commission recommended that the Governor should be a detached figure without intense political links. The other options incorrectly pair the commissions/committees with their focus areas. The Rajamannar Committee and the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution did not primarily focus on the areas mentioned in the corresponding pairs. Thus, only option (b) correctly matches two pairs. Option (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article        Key Provision
1. Article 124                    :   Establishes the Supreme Court
2. Article 32                     :   Guarantees the right to constitutional remedies
3. Article 356                    :   Provides for President's Rule
4. Article 143                   :   Allows the President to consult the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Article 124 establishes the Supreme Court of India. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, allowing citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Article 356 deals with the imposition of President's rule in a state. Article 143 empowers the President to consult with the Supreme Court on legal matters.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, and only option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching of all four pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body       Primary Responsibility
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Recruitment to All India Services
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)  :   Auditing Union Government accounts
3. Election Commission of India           :   Conducting elections to Parliament and State Assemblies
4. Finance Commission                    :   Recommending distribution of tax revenue between Centre and States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent the primary responsibilities of the respective constitutional bodies.  The UPSC is primarily responsible for recruitment to the All India Services and other central government services. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union Government. The Election Commission conducts elections. The Finance Commission makes recommendations on the distribution of tax revenue. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and incorrect.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Document      Significant Feature/Provision
1. Nehru Report             :   Proposed a federal system
2. Government of India Act 1935:   Introduced provincial autonomy
3. Indian Independence Act :   Transferred power from British Parliament
4. Indian Constitution      :   Established a parliamentary system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate reflections of the key features of the listed political documents. The Nehru Report advocated for a federal structure for India. The Government of India Act 1935 introduced a significant degree of provincial autonomy. The Indian Independence Act formally transferred legislative and executive power from the British Parliament to the Indian Constituent Assembly. The Indian Constitution formally established the parliamentary system of government in India.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept/Doctrine    Application in Indian Context
1. Doctrine of Severability :   Used by the Supreme Court to uphold parts of a law
2. Doctrine of Eclipse      :   Applies when a law conflicts with Fundamental Rights
3. Doctrine of Prospective Overruling:   Allows the Supreme Court to modify past judgments prospectively
4.  Parliamentary Sovereignty:   Limited by the Constitution and Judicial Review


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Doctrine of Severability is used by the Supreme Court to separate valid portions of a law from invalid ones. The Doctrine of Eclipse explains the effect of a law that conflicts with Fundamental Rights; the law is not void but merely eclipsed until the conflicting provision is removed. The Doctrine of Prospective Overruling allows the Supreme Court to change its past judgments without affecting past decisions.  Parliamentary sovereignty, a key element of the British system, is significantly limited in the Indian context due to the written constitution, fundamental rights, and judicial review.  Therefore, (d) is the correct option.



**10.  With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

     Legal Concept              Constitutional Provision/Article
1.  Fundamental Rights          :   Part III
2.  Directive Principles of State Policy :   Part IV
3.  Fundamental Duties          :   Article 51A
4.  Emergency Provisions       :   Articles 352, 356, 360


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key provision of the Indian Constitution. Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III. Directive Principles of State Policy are found in Part IV. Fundamental Duties are detailed in Article 51A. Emergency provisions are covered by Articles 352 (National Emergency), 356 (President's Rule), and 360 (Financial Emergency). Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body       Action Related to the Budget
1. Rajya Sabha           :   Approves the Budget
2. Lok Sabha             :   Introduces the Finance Bill
3. President              :   Presents the Budget to Parliament
4. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):   Audits the Budget

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The correct pairs are 2 and 3. The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament, plays a crucial role in the budgetary process by introducing the Finance Bill, which outlines the government's proposed taxation and expenditure. The President, as the head of state, formally presents the budget to the Parliament, signifying the commencement of the budgetary debate and approval process.  Option 1 is incorrect because while the Rajya Sabha can discuss and make recommendations on the Budget, it cannot reject or amend a Money Bill.  Option 4 is incorrect because the CAG audits the government's accounts *after* the budget has been passed, ensuring accountability for expenditure.  Therefore, the CAG's role is post-budgetary, not directly related to the initial approval process. The question highlights the intricate interplay between different branches of government in the Indian financial system, a crucial aspect for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body       Power Related to Constitutional Amendments
1. Lok Sabha             :   Initiates the amendment process
2. Rajya Sabha           :   Requires a simple majority for some amendments
3. President              :   Gives assent to the amendment
4. State Legislatures    :   Required for amendment of certain provisions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correct pairs are 1, 3, and 4.  The Lok Sabha, as the lower house, can initiate the process of constitutional amendment. The President, as the head of state, has the power to give assent to the amendment bill once passed by Parliament.  Certain amendments require the ratification of at least half of the state legislatures. Option 2 is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha's role in constitutional amendments is not solely limited to a simple majority.  While a simple majority is required for some amendments, others necessitate a special majority in both houses.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the amendment process, highlighting the balance of power between the Union and the States in altering the Constitution.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                 Key Provision
1. Government of India Act 1919       :   Introduction of Dyarchy
2. Government of India Act 1935       :   Establishment of an All-India Federation
3. Indian Independence Act 1947       :   Transfer of power to Indian hands
4. Regulating Act of 1773             :   Establishment of a Supreme Court in Calcutta

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced the system of Dyarchy (dual governance) in the provinces. The Government of India Act, 1935, established a federal structure with an All-India Federation. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, transferred legislative sovereignty to India, paving the way for independence. The Regulating Act of 1773 established the Supreme Court of Judicature at Calcutta, marking a significant step in the evolution of the Indian judicial system.  This question tests knowledge of significant historical acts and their impact on the governance structure of India, a recurring theme in UPSC exams.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution   Subject Matter
1. Article 245                  :   Extent of laws made by Parliament
2. Article 246                  :   Subject matter of laws made by Parliament
3. Article 356                  :   President's rule in states
4. Article 368                  :   Amendment of the Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Article 245 of the Indian Constitution deals with the territorial extent of laws made by Parliament. Article 246 specifies the subject matter of such laws, dividing legislative powers between the Union and the States. Article 356 empowers the President to impose President's Rule in a state if the state government fails to function according to constitutional provisions. Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution.  This demonstrates a solid understanding of the fundamental articles governing the legislative and executive powers of the Indian government. The ability to recall and link these articles accurately is essential for UPSC success.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body        Accountability
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Parliament through the Government
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)   :   Parliament
3. Election Commission of India (ECI)     :   President of India
4. Finance Commission                       :   Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correct pairs are 1, 2, and 4. The UPSC is accountable to Parliament indirectly through the government, which presents its reports to Parliament.  The CAG is directly accountable to Parliament, presenting its audit reports to both Houses. The Finance Commission also submits its reports to Parliament, though its recommendations are not binding. Option 3 is incorrect as the Election Commission is not accountable to the President. While the President appoints the Election Commissioners, the Commission enjoys functional independence from the executive. This question assesses the understanding of the accountability mechanisms of different constitutional bodies, a vital component of Indian governance.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body           Power Related to State Legislative Assemblies
1. Parliament                 :   Can dissolve a State Legislative Assembly
2. President                  :   Can impose President's Rule
3. Governor                   :   Appoints the Chief Minister
4. State Legislature           :   Elects the Speaker

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correct pairs are 2, 3, and 4. The President has the power to impose President's Rule in a state under Article 356. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister, who commands the majority in the State Legislative Assembly. The State Legislative Assembly elects its own Speaker. Option 1 is incorrect; Parliament does not have the power to directly dissolve a State Legislative Assembly. While President's Rule can lead to the Assembly's dissolution, it's the President, not Parliament, that holds this power. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the powers and functions of various constitutional bodies at the state level. The nuanced distinction between the powers of different entities is a common testing ground in UPSC exams.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept             Article of the Constitution
1. Right to Equality          :   Article 17
2. Right to Freedom           :   Article 21
3. Right against Exploitation :   Article 23
4. Right to Constitutional Remedies: Article 32

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Article 23 deals with the Right against Exploitation, prohibiting traffic in human beings and forced labour. Article 32 guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies, enabling citizens to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights. Option 1 is incorrect; Article 17 abolishes untouchability, not the Right to Equality (which is covered by Article 14 and subsequent articles). Option 2 is incorrect; Article 21 guarantees the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, not the Right to Freedom (which is a broader concept encompassing several articles in Part III). This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution and their specific constitutional basis.  The subtle differences between similar-sounding rights are a frequent testing strategy in UPSC.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body        Specific Power or Function
1. Lok Sabha              :   Impeaches the President
2. Rajya Sabha           :   Elects the Vice-President
3. President               :   Appoints the Prime Minister
4. Supreme Court          :   Judicial Review

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Lok Sabha, along with the Rajya Sabha, plays a crucial role in the impeachment of the President. The Rajya Sabha elects the Vice-President. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who then forms the Council of Ministers. The Supreme Court exercises the power of judicial review, ensuring the constitutionality of laws and government actions. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the powers and functions of the different branches of the Indian government.  The accurate linking of powers to the correct institutions is crucial for understanding the Indian political system.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment of the Constitution    Specific Provision Affected
1. 42nd Amendment                 :   Added "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble
2. 44th Amendment                 :   Restored the original position of Article 368
3. 73rd Amendment                 :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
4. 74th Amendment                 :   Established Urban Local Governments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, added the words "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble of the Constitution.  The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 reversed certain changes made to Article 368 by the 42nd Amendment, restoring its original form. The 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts of 1992 established the Panchayati Raj and Urban Local Government systems, respectively, marking a significant step towards decentralization. This question assesses the understanding of major constitutional amendments and their impact on various aspects of the Indian political and administrative system.  Knowing these amendments and their specific provisions is a high-yield area for UPSC.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bill                     House of Origin
1. Money Bill                      :   Rajya Sabha
2. Financial Bill                   :   Lok Sabha
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill :   Lok Sabha
4. Ordinary Bill                     :   Either House

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Financial Bills, which deal with taxation and government spending, can originate in either House. Constitutional Amendment Bills can also originate in either House. Ordinary bills are also introduced in either House.  However, Money Bills, which deal exclusively with financial matters, must originate in the Lok Sabha. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the different types of bills and their constitutional procedure.  The nuanced distinction between different types of bills and their origin is important for UPSC.



**11. Consider the following pairs:**

    Feature of Indian Federalism       Characteristic
1. Written Constitution             :   Provides a framework for the distribution of powers
2. Distribution of Powers             :   Divides powers between the Union and the States
3. Independent Judiciary             :   Ensures the separation of powers
4. Dual Polity                         :   Combines features of both federal and unitary systems

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. A written constitution is a fundamental feature of federal systems, providing a clear framework for the distribution of powers between different levels of government. The distribution of powers between the Union and the States is a defining characteristic of federalism. An independent judiciary is crucial for maintaining the balance of power and upholding the rule of law in a federal system.  India's federal system is a unique blend of federal and unitary features, exhibiting characteristics of a dual polity. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the essential elements of the Indian federal system. The ability to identify and analyze these characteristics is crucial for answering questions related to Indian governance.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

     Constitutional Body              Primary Function
1. Finance Commission                :   Advises on the distribution of tax revenue
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Conducts civil service examinations
3. Election Commission of India (ECI) :   Conducts elections
4. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):  Investigates human rights violations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Finance Commission is primarily responsible for advising the government on the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and the States. The UPSC conducts civil service examinations for recruitment to various government positions. The ECI conducts elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, and other bodies. The NHRC investigates human rights violations and makes recommendations to the government. This question tests the candidate's knowledge about the functions of major constitutional bodies in India, requiring factual recall and analytical understanding.  A thorough understanding of these bodies is essential for UPSC preparation.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

      Legal Right                  Associated Article
1. Right to Life and Personal Liberty: Article 19
2. Right to Freedom of Religion    : Article 25
3. Right to Constitutional Remedies: Article 32
4. Right to Equality              : Article 14

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correctly matched pairs are 2, 3, and 4. Article 25 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Freedom of Religion.  Article 32 guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies, which is a crucial right enabling citizens to approach the courts for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Article 14 guarantees the Right to Equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Option 1 is incorrect, as Article 19 deals with the Right to Freedom, including freedom of speech, assembly, etc., while Article 21 protects the Right to Life and Personal Liberty. This question tests the understanding of fundamental rights and their corresponding articles, requiring accurate recall of constitutional provisions.  The ability to differentiate between similar rights is a key skill tested in UPSC.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept                  Related Constitutional Provision
1. Parliamentary Sovereignty    :   Article 123
2. Judicial Review                 :   Article 32
3. Federalism                      :   Seventh Schedule
4. Directive Principles of State Policy: Part IV

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correctly matched pairs are 2, 3, and 4.  Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, which is the foundation for judicial review.  The Seventh Schedule outlines the division of powers between the Union and the States, forming the basis of federalism in India. Part IV of the Constitution enshrines the Directive Principles of State Policy. Option 1 is incorrect; Article 123 deals with the President's power to issue ordinances, not Parliamentary sovereignty. While Parliament holds significant power, the concept of Parliamentary sovereignty is not explicitly mentioned in a single article but is derived from the Constitution's overall structure. This question delves into the core concepts of Indian constitutional law, requiring both factual knowledge and understanding of fundamental legal principles.  The ability to connect constitutional provisions with abstract legal concepts is vital for UPSC.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

     Tax Type                       Levied By
1. Income Tax                       :   State Governments
2. Goods and Services Tax (GST)    :   Union Government
3. Stamp Duty                       :   State Governments
4. Customs Duty                     :   Union Government

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. GST is levied by the Union Government, and Customs Duty is also a Union tax. Option 1 is incorrect as Income Tax is a tax levied by the Union Government. Option 3 is incorrect as Stamp Duty is levied by State Governments. This question tests the understanding of the division of taxation powers between the Union and State governments in India.  Accurate knowledge of the tax system is essential for UPSC preparation.  The question uses plausible distractors to test for precise knowledge of the tax regime.


**16. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                  Power or Function
1. Lok Sabha                         :   Passes Money Bills
2. Rajya Sabha                        :   Can delay Money Bills
3. President                          :   Gives Assent to Bills
4. Supreme Court                     :   Judicial Review

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Lok Sabha, as the lower house, has the primary power to pass Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha can only delay Money Bills for a maximum of 14 days. The President gives assent to bills passed by both Houses of Parliament. The Supreme Court exercises judicial review, ensuring the constitutionality of laws and government actions. This question tests the understanding of the legislative and executive processes in the Indian political system.  The question tests the candidate’s ability to recall details about the powers of different government organs.


**17. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Emergency                Declared By
1. National Emergency              :   Parliament
2. State Emergency (President's Rule):   President
3. Financial Emergency              :   President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  A State Emergency (President's Rule) is declared by the President under Article 356. A Financial Emergency is also declared by the President under Article 360.  A National Emergency is declared by the President, but this proclamation must be approved by Parliament within a specified timeframe.  This question assesses understanding of the different types of emergencies and the constitutional provisions governing their declaration. The question tests nuanced knowledge of constitutional provisions.


**18. Consider the following pairs:**

      Committee of Parliament             Function
1. Public Accounts Committee           :   Examines the annual accounts of the government
2. Estimates Committee                  :   Scrutinizes the budget estimates
3. Committee on Public Undertakings    :   Examines the working of public sector undertakings
4. Committee on Subordinate Legislation:   Scrutinizes delegated legislation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Public Accounts Committee examines the government's annual accounts, ensuring that public funds are utilized effectively and accountably. The Estimates Committee scrutinizes the budget estimates, analyzing the government's proposed expenditure. The Committee on Public Undertakings examines the working of public sector undertakings, assessing their efficiency and performance. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation scrutinizes delegated legislation, ensuring that the executive exercises its rule-making powers within the confines of the law.  This question assesses knowledge of parliamentary committees and their functions, requiring factual recall and a conceptual understanding of their roles in governmental oversight.  This is a high-yield area for UPSC.


**19. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Position of Rajya Sabha        Description
1. Equal to Lok Sabha in ordinary bill passage  :   Both houses have equal powers
2. Unequal to Lok Sabha on Money Bills      :   Lok Sabha has overriding power
3. Special Powers not shared with Lok Sabha   :   Can initiate removal of the Vice-President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have equal powers in passing ordinary bills.  However, in the case of Money Bills, the Lok Sabha holds overriding power. The Rajya Sabha has the exclusive power to initiate the process of removing the Vice-President. This question requires a nuanced understanding of the Rajya Sabha's constitutional position relative to the Lok Sabha.  The ability to differentiate between areas of equal and unequal power is crucial.


**20. Consider the following pairs:**

    Power of the President                    Source
1. Ordinance-making power                 :   Article 123
2. Appointing the Prime Minister           :   Constitutional Convention
3. Dissolution of Lok Sabha                :   Article 85
4. Impeachment of the President           :   Articles 61 and 111


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Article 123 grants the President ordinance-making power.  The appointment of the Prime Minister is based on constitutional convention; although the President has the power to appoint, the convention dictates that the person who commands a majority in the Lok Sabha is appointed. Article 85 deals with the President's power to dissolve the Lok Sabha.  Pair 4 is incorrect; while Articles 61 and 111 are relevant to the President's impeachment, the impeachment process itself is initiated by Parliament, not the President. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the President's powers, distinguishing between constitutional powers and conventions.  The ability to identify the correct source of each power is tested here.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Subject Matter
1. Article 370                      :   Special status of Jammu and Kashmir
2. Article 368                      :   Amendment procedure
3. Article 51A                      :   Fundamental Duties
4. Article 21                       :   Right to Life and Personal Liberty
5. Article 28                       :   Freedom of conscience

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 370, prior to its abrogation, dealt with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. Article 51A lists the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens. Article 21 guarantees the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, a cornerstone of fundamental rights.  Article 28 ensures freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all five pairs as correctly matched is the correct answer. The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these accurately paired articles and their subject matters.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Key Figure in Drafting the Constitution    Role/Contribution
1. Mahatma Gandhi                     :   Chairman of the Drafting Committee
2. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar           :   Advocated for separate electorates
3. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar                  :   Chief architect of the Constitution
4. Jawaharlal Nehru                    :   Presented the Objectives Resolution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was the chairman of the Drafting Committee and played a pivotal role in drafting the Indian Constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru introduced the Objectives Resolution, which guided the Constituent Assembly's work.  The other options are incorrect.  Mahatma Gandhi, while influential in the independence movement, did not chair the Drafting Committee. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar did not advocate for separate electorates; in fact, he opposed them.  Therefore, option (c) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Feature            Characteristic
1.  Federal System                   :   Vesting of residuary powers with the states
2.  Parliamentary System            :   Head of State distinct from Head of Government
3.  Single Citizenship               :   Uniform rights across the country
4.  Judicial Review                  :   Power of the judiciary to strike down laws
5.  Amendment Procedure              :  Requires ratification by half of the state legislatures for certain provisions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Indian Constitution establishes a single citizenship, meaning all citizens have uniform rights regardless of their state of residence.  Judicial review is the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of laws and executive orders. The amendment procedure for certain provisions necessitates the approval of half of the state legislatures.  The other pairs are incorrect.  The Indian federal system vests residuary powers with the Centre, not the states.  While the parliamentary system features a Head of State (President) distinct from the Head of Government (Prime Minister), this is not the sole defining characteristic. Option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Influence on Indian Constitution    Specific Aspect Borrowed
1. Government of India Act 1935             :   Fundamental Rights
2. British Constitution                     :   Parliamentary System
3. American Constitution                   :   Preamble
4. Irish Constitution                      :   Directive Principles of State Policy
5. Canadian Constitution                   :   Federal System (strong Centre)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because the Indian Constitution borrowed the Parliamentary system from the British Constitution,  Directive Principles from the Irish Constitution, and the federal system with a strong Centre from the Canadian Constitution.  The other options contain inaccuracies.  While the Government of India Act 1935 provided a framework, the Fundamental Rights as enshrined in the Indian Constitution are significantly different and evolved beyond the provisions of the 1935 Act. The Preamble, though similar in structure to the American Preamble, reflects distinct Indian ideals.  Therefore, option (d) correctly identifies the accurate pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Provision in the Indian Constitution       Impact/Feature
1. Article 370 (pre-abrogation)             :   Asymmetric federalism
2. Preamble                                 :   Declaration of Socialist ideals
3. Seventh Schedule                          :   Distribution of powers between Union and States
4. Articles 29 & 30                        :   Protection of linguistic and religious minorities
5. Fundamental Rights                       :  Not justiciable in all circumstances

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Articles 370 (prior to its revocation), the Seventh Schedule, and Articles 29 & 30 are correctly paired with their respective impacts/features.  Article 370 exemplified asymmetric federalism due to its unique provisions for Jammu and Kashmir. The Seventh Schedule details the division of powers between the Union and States. Articles 29 and 30 safeguard the rights of linguistic and religious minorities.   Option (b) is incorrect as the Preamble does not explicitly declare Socialist ideals; these were incorporated later. Option (c) is incorrect because fundamental rights are, for the most part, justiciable (enforceable by courts).  Option (d) incorrectly includes the inaccurate pairing of the Preamble and Socialist ideals.  Therefore, only option (a) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Body                        Function/Power
1.  Supreme Court                       :   Appoints the Election Commissioner
2.  President of India                  :   Dissolves the Lok Sabha
3.  Parliament                          :   Amends the Constitution
4.  Election Commission                   :   Decides election disputes related to the President
5.  Union Ministry of Home Affairs        :   Conducts general elections

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The President of India has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha. Parliament, through its constituent power, has the authority to amend the Constitution. The other options are incorrect. The Election Commission, not the Supreme Court, is an independent body that conducts elections and the President's election disputes are handled by the Supreme Court. The Election Commission, an independent body, conducts general elections, not the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.  The Supreme Court does not appoint the Election Commissioners; they are appointed by the President. Therefore, option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Principle                      Description/Feature
1.  Quasi-federal                     :   Independent judiciary with judicial review
2.  Secularism                           :   Mutual exclusion of state and religion
3.  Universal Adult Franchise           :   'One person, one vote' principle
4.  Social Justice                       :   Caste-based affirmative action programmes
5.  Asymmetric Federalism               :   Equal representation of states in the Rajya Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Secularism, in its purest form, implies the separation of religion from the state, although India’s secularism is unique. Universal adult franchise is based on the principle of 'one person, one vote'.  Social justice in India is reflected in the implementation of caste-based affirmative action programmes.  Option (d) is incorrect, as quasi-federalism is characterized by a blend of federal and unitary features, and the Indian judiciary's role, while crucial, is not the sole defining element.  Asymmetric federalism includes unequal representation of states, making option (d) incorrect. Option (a) is also incorrect. Therefore, option (c) correctly identifies the correctly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Amendment Act           Significant Provision
1. 42nd Amendment Act                     :  Added Fundamental Duties
2. 73rd Amendment Act                     :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 74th Amendment Act                     :   Established Municipal Corporations
4. First Amendment Act                    :   Abolition of Untouchability
5. 44th Amendment Act                     :   Introduced the concept of Secularism

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd, 73rd, and 74th Amendment Acts are correctly paired with their respective provisions. The 42nd Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 73rd Amendment Act established Panchayati Raj Institutions at the local level. The 74th Amendment Act established Municipalities. The other options contain inaccuracies.  The abolition of untouchability was already a part of the original Constitution (Article 17), not introduced by the First Amendment. The concept of Secularism was implicitly present in the original Constitution and was not explicitly introduced via the 44th Amendment. Therefore, option (a) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Indian Parliament.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body     Action/Power
1. Parliament          :   Appoints the Governor of a State
2. Parliament          :   Directly approves foreign loans taken by a State
3. Parliament          :   Establishes the Inter-State Council
4. Rajya Sabha         :   Has the sole power to initiate Money Bills.
5. Lok Sabha           :   Can impeach the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The President appoints Governors of states on the advice of the Council of Ministers which is accountable to the Parliament. The Parliament, therefore, indirectly plays a role in the appointment. The Inter-State Council's establishment is mandated by the Constitution and is the responsibility of the President, acting on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers which is accountable to the Parliament.  The Lok Sabha, along with the Rajya Sabha, has the power to impeach the President through a special majority.  Options 2 and 4 are incorrect.  States cannot take foreign loans directly; they require central government approval.  Money Bills can only originate in the Lok Sabha; the Rajya Sabha can only review them.


**2.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Legislative Body        Legislative Power
1. State Legislature      :   Exclusive power over subjects in the Union List
2. Parliament             :   Legislative power over Union Territories like Puducherry and Delhi
3. Parliament             :   Power to legislate on State List subjects during a National Emergency.
4. State Legislature      :   Power to amend the Constitution
5. Parliament             :   Power to create All-India Services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Parliament has legislative power over Union Territories. During a National Emergency, Parliament can legislate on subjects in the State List. The Parliament also has the power to create All-India Services.  Option 1 is incorrect because the Union List is exclusively under the Parliament's jurisdiction, not the State Legislature.  Option 4 is incorrect as the power to amend the Constitution rests with Parliament, not individual State Legislatures.


**3. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

    Committee                      Function
1. Public Accounts Committee     :   Scrutinizes the Union Budget
2. Estimates Committee            :   Examines government spending
3. Committee on Public Undertakings:   Reviews the performance of public sector undertakings
4. Committee on Subordinate Legislation: Advises on the use of Official Languages
5. Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs): Oversee the work of various ministries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Estimates Committee scrutinizes government spending. The Committee on Public Undertakings reviews the performance of PSUs.  Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) oversee the work of ministries. Option 1 is incorrect; the Public Accounts Committee examines the appropriation accounts and audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), not the Union Budget itself. Option 4 is incorrect; the Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines delegated legislation, not language use.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Key Provision/Impact
1.  Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010  :  Established the National Green Tribunal
2.  Representation of People Act, 1951             :   Governs elections to Parliament and State Legislatures
3.  Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957:  Relates to citizenship rights
4.  The Contingency Fund of India Act, 1950        :   Established the National Commission for Scheduled Castes
5.  States Reorganisation Act of 1956              :    Created five zonal councils


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Representation of the People Act, 1951, governs elections. The Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, deals with residency requirements for public employment, indirectly impacting citizenship. The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 led to the creation of zonal councils.  Options 1 and 4 are incorrect. The Ancient Monuments Act does not establish the NGT. The Contingency Fund Act establishes the Contingency Fund of India, not the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.


**5. With reference to the powers of the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

    Power/Function                                 Constitutional Basis
1.  Power to amend the Constitution               : Article 368
2.  Power to establish new states                  : Article 3
3.  Power to legislate on residuary subjects       : Article 246
4.  Power to regulate interstate trade and commerce:  Article 301
5. Power to impose gift tax                         :  Article 265


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 368 deals with the amendment of the Constitution. Article 3 empowers Parliament to form new states. Article 301 deals with interstate trade and commerce. Option 3 is incorrect; Article 246 allocates legislative powers to the Union and States, but residuary powers are vested in Parliament by implication, not explicitly stated in this article. Option 5 is incorrect because Article 265 prohibits the Union from levying taxes without the authority of the law.  The power to impose gift tax is derived from other legislative powers granted to Parliament.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party Action                     Governing Body/Law
1. Allotment of Election Symbols           :   Ministry of Home Affairs
2. Nomination of Candidates                :   State Election Commission
3. Reporting of Contributions              :   National Human Rights Commission
4. Claiming Income Tax Relief              :   Income Tax Department
5.  Regulation of Election Campaigns       :    Supreme Court of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the fourth pair is correctly matched.  The Income Tax Department governs the tax regulations under which political parties can claim income tax relief.  The other pairs are incorrect.  The Election Commission of India, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, allots election symbols to political parties.  Similarly, political parties nominate their candidates, a process overseen by the Election Commission, not the State Election Commission. The Election Commission of India, not the National Human Rights Commission, is the body to which political parties report their contributions. The Election Commission of India, not the Supreme Court, regulates election campaigns according to the Model Code of Conduct.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles of different governmental bodies in regulating political parties in India.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Funding Source/Mechanism                 Recipient
1. Cash Donations                            :   National Development Council
2. Foreign Funds                             :   Election Commission of India
3. Corporate Donations                       :   Reserve Bank of India
4. Electoral Bonds                           :   State-level political parties only
5. Political Funding from Trade Unions      :    Individual candidates

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Political parties receive cash donations, but these are not channeled through the National Development Council.  The Election Commission of India regulates the acceptance of foreign funds by political parties, but doesn't directly receive them.  Corporate donations fund political parties, but the Reserve Bank of India is not involved in this process.  Electoral bonds are a mechanism for funding political parties at both national and state levels. Trade unions may contribute to political funding, but this is typically directed towards parties or individual candidates, not exclusively one or the other. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the complexities of political funding in India.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between related but distinct entities and processes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party Activity                    Regulatory Body
1. Preparation of Electoral Rolls           :   Supreme Court of India
2. Influences Enrollment of Eligible Voters :   National Human Rights Commission
3. Resolves Disputes for Political Parties  :   Central Vigilance Commission
4. Grants Recognition to Political Parties :   Ministry of Law and Justice
5. Subject to the Model Code of Conduct   :   Parliament of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the fifth pair is correctly matched. Political parties are subject to the Model Code of Conduct, which is enforced by the Election Commission of India and is a crucial part of the electoral process in India.  The other pairs are incorrect.  Political parties do not prepare electoral rolls; that is the responsibility of the Election Commission of India.  Political parties influence voter enrollment, but this is not directly regulated by the National Human Rights Commission. The Election Commission of India, not the Central Vigilance Commission, resolves disputes between political parties.  The Election Commission of India, not the Ministry of Law and Justice, grants recognition to political parties.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the regulatory framework governing Indian political parties and their activities. The distractors are carefully chosen to challenge the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various government bodies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Political Party Function                 Accountability Mechanism
1. Receives Political Funding              :   Central Bureau of Investigation
2. Incurred Election Expenses             :    Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance
3. Maintains Political Party Accounts      :   Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India
4. Nominates Candidates for Elections     :    National Human Rights Commission
5. Participates in Elections              :    Supreme Court of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched.  Political parties are required to maintain accounts, and these accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). The other pairs are incorrect. While political parties receive political funding, the CBI is not the primary accountability mechanism.  The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance does not primarily oversee election expenses; the Election Commission does. The Election Commission oversees the nomination of candidates, not the National Human Rights Commission.  The Election Commission of India, not the Supreme Court, is the primary body overseeing the participation of political parties in elections.  This question tests understanding of the financial and electoral accountability mechanisms for political parties in India. The distractors represent plausible but incorrect links between party functions and oversight bodies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                  Related Body/Concept
1.  Article 368                               :   President's Rule
2.  Article 356                               :   Amendment procedure
3.  The Eighth Schedule                       :   Recognition of National Parties
4.  The Preamble                             :   National Language
5.  Directive Principles of State Policy      :   Enforcement by Courts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. Directive Principles of State Policy are not directly enforceable by courts, but they guide the state's policy and actions.  The other pairs are incorrect. Article 368 deals with the amendment procedure, not President’s Rule (which is under Article 356).  Article 356 deals with President's Rule, not the amendment procedure. The Eighth Schedule lists the recognized languages of India, not the recognition of national parties (which is done by the Election Commission). The Preamble to the Constitution lays out the ideals of the nation, but it doesn’t designate a national language (Hindi is the official language, but not the national language, and the Constitution doesn't specify a national language).  This question tests detailed knowledge of the Indian Constitution and its key provisions. The distractors are designed to be plausible to those with a less-than-complete understanding of the subject matter.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governmental Body                Key Function/Responsibility
1.  Finance Commission              :   Advising on the distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and States
2.  National Development Council    :   Formulating Five-Year Plans
3.  Inter-State Council              :   Resolving disputes between states
4.  Supreme Court                    :   Interpreting the Constitution and resolving Centre-State disputes on legal matters.
5.  Election Commission of India      :   Conducting elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in India's fiscal federalism by recommending the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and State governments.  The National Development Council, though not explicitly mentioned in the constitution, has historically played a significant role in formulating India's Five-Year Plans, representing a crucial aspect of centralized economic planning. The Inter-State Council, established under Article 263, serves as a platform for resolving disputes between states. The Supreme Court, as the highest court of appeal, interprets the Constitution and settles Centre-State disputes on legal matters related to the division of powers.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is constitutionally mandated to conduct free and fair elections to the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Subject Matter
1. Article 1                         :   Establishment of a Parliamentary System
2. Article 263                       :   Establishment of the Inter-State Council
3. Article 280                       :   Establishment of the Finance Commission
4. Article 32                        :   Enforcement of Fundamental Rights
5. Article 356                       :   Provisions for President's Rule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Article 1 establishes India as a Union of States, it doesn't explicitly establish a parliamentary system; that's implied by other articles and the overall structure. Articles 263, 280, 32, and 356 directly address the subjects mentioned in the pairs.  Article 263 deals with the establishment of the Inter-State Council. Article 280 lays down the procedure for establishing the Finance Commission. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies for enforcement of fundamental rights. Article 356 deals with the failure of constitutional machinery in a state and the imposition of President's Rule.  Therefore, option (c) is correct. Option (a) is incorrect because Article 1 does not explicitly establish a parliamentary system. Option (b) is incorrect as it excludes Article 356. Option (d) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Body             Primary Focus
1. Sarkaria Commission          :    Electoral Reforms
2. Punchhi Commission           :   Centre-State Relations
3. Finance Commission           :   Fiscal distribution between the Centre and States
4. Election Commission of India :   Appointment of judges to the Supreme Court
5. National Human Rights Commission :   Protection of civil liberties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Sarkaria Commission focused on Centre-State relations, not electoral reforms. The Punchhi Commission also dealt with Centre-State relations, particularly focusing on the strengthening of the federal structure.  The Finance Commission's primary responsibility is the distribution of financial resources between the Union and State governments. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting elections, not appointing judges. The National Human Rights Commission is concerned with the protection of human rights, including civil liberties.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched, making option (d) correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly match at least one pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision          Power/Responsibility
1.  Union List                       :   Matters related to agriculture and law and order
2.  State List                       :   Matters related to defence and foreign affairs
3.  Concurrent List                   :   Matters related to education and forests
4.  Residuary Powers                 :   Matters not specifically listed in the Union, State, or Concurrent Lists
5.  Article 356                       :   Matters related to the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Union List contains subjects of national importance like defence and foreign affairs, not agriculture and law and order (which are primarily State List subjects). The State List includes matters like agriculture and law and order. The Concurrent List includes subjects like education and forests. Residuary powers are indeed those not specified in the other lists. Article 356 deals with the proclamation of President's Rule, not the appointment of Supreme Court judges. Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the distribution of powers under the Indian Constitution.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                  Specific Mandate
1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)       :   Regulation of the banking sector
2.  Supreme Court                     :   Maintaining law and order
3.  Election Commission of India (ECI) :   Conducting elections
4.  Finance Commission                  :   Managing foreign policy
5.  National Human Rights Commission :   Protecting human rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI's primary function is regulating the banking sector. The Supreme Court's role is primarily judicial, not maintaining law and order (that's the responsibility of police and other law enforcement agencies). The ECI's mandate is conducting elections. The Finance Commission deals with fiscal matters, not foreign policy (that's the Ministry of External Affairs' domain). The National Human Rights Commission is responsible for protecting human rights. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                    Key Provision
1. Government of India Act, 1935 :   Established a bicameral legislature
2.  73rd Constitutional Amendment :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
3.  74th Constitutional Amendment :   Established Nagaland as a state
4.  69th Constitutional Amendment :   Provided for the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
5.  42nd Constitutional Amendment :    Introduced Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, did indeed establish a bicameral legislature at both the central and provincial levels.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act introduced provisions for Panchayati Raj Institutions. The 16th Amendment Act, not the 74th, established Nagaland as a state. The 69th Amendment did not relate to the CAG's appointment (that is established by the Constitution itself). The 42nd Amendment Act incorporated Fundamental Duties into the Constitution. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Landmark Supreme Court Case        Key Legal Principle Established/Affirmed
1.  Kesavananda Bharati Case         :   Doctrine of Essential Features of the Constitution
2.  Minerva Mills Case               :    Judicial Review of Fundamental Rights
3.  S.R. Bommai Case                 :   Limits on the application of Article 356
4.  Golaknath Case                   :   Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights
5.  I.R. Coelho Case                 :   Judicial Review of Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case established the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution. The Minerva Mills case dealt with the limits of Parliament's amending power, affirming the concept of basic structure. The S.R. Bommai case significantly restricted the use of Article 356 (President's Rule). The Golaknath case, not the Golaknath case, held that Parliament couldn't amend Fundamental Rights. The I.R. Coelho case related to the judicial review of laws affecting Fundamental Rights, not Fundamental Duties. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly match at least one pair.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Institution/Body           Key Characteristic/Function
1.  Parliament                        :   Amending the Constitution
2.  President                          :   Appointing the Chief Justice of India
3.  Supreme Court                     :   Enacting legislation
4.  Election Commission of India (ECI) :   Declaring financial emergency
5.  Finance Commission                 :   Recommending tax distribution between Centre and States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Parliament does have the power to amend the Constitution. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India. The Supreme Court interprets laws but doesn't enact them (that's Parliament's role).  The President, not the ECI, declares a financial emergency. The Finance Commission recommends principles governing the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched. Other options include incorrectly matched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Policy/Program           Implementing Ministry/Agency
1. National Food Security Act      :   Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution
2. National Health Policy          :   Ministry of Health & Family Welfare
3.  National Education Policy       :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
4.  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA):  Ministry of Panchayati Raj
5. National Policy on Biofuels      :   Ministry of Renewable Energy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act is implemented primarily by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. The National Health Policy falls under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The National Education Policy is implemented by the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The NREGA is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. The National Policy on Biofuels is implemented by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.  Other options include incorrectly matched pairs.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Language              State/Region where predominantly spoken
1.  Kannada                          :   Tamil Nadu
2.  Malayalam                        :   Karnataka
3.  Telugu                           :   Andhra Pradesh
4.  Tamil                            :   Kerala
5.  Marathi                          :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Kannada is the primary language of Karnataka, not Tamil Nadu. Malayalam is predominantly spoken in Kerala, not Karnataka. Telugu is the main language of Andhra Pradesh. Tamil is the main language of Tamil Nadu, not Kerala. Marathi is the main language of Maharashtra. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  The other options contain incorrectly matched pairs, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of regional linguistic distribution in India.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions on Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, Governor's role, and related aspects of Indian federalism, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is intentionally high, aiming to challenge candidates with plausible distractors and requiring precise knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Constitutional Article**             **Subject Matter**
1. Article 352                               :   National Emergency
2. Article 356                               :   President's Rule in a State
3. Article 360                               :   Financial Emergency
4. Article 265                               :   No tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law
5. Article 365                               :   Failure of a State to comply with Union directives


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a national emergency. Article 356 empowers the President to impose President's Rule in a state. Article 360 deals with the proclamation of a financial emergency. Article 265 protects against unauthorized taxation. Article 365 addresses the consequences of a state's failure to comply with Union directives.  The options are designed to test the candidate's thorough understanding of the various emergency provisions and other relevant articles in the Indian Constitution.  Incorrect options strategically omit or misrepresent the relationship between the articles and their subjects.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Constitutional Amendment Act**       **Key Provision Related to Federalism**
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976             :   Added "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble
2. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992             :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 74th Amendment Act, 1992             :   Established Municipalities
4. 44th Amendment Act, 1978             :   Curtailed the scope of Article 356
5. 38th Amendment Act, 1975             :   Strengthened the Presidential powers under Article 356


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options (b) and (c) are designed as distractors, including partially correct pairings. Option (a) is a simple distractor, offering only one correct match.  Option (d) is correct because all the listed pairs accurately connect the constitutional amendment acts with their significant impact on India’s federal structure. The 73rd and 74th amendments significantly decentralized power to local bodies. The 44th amendment restricted the misuse of Article 356, while the 38th amendment, enacted during the Emergency, actually expanded the President's powers under Article 356, making it a crucial detail for a comprehensive understanding.  The 42nd amendment, while important, is a distractor here as it primarily focuses on the Preamble and not directly on federal relations.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Governor, consider the following pairs:**

   **Power of the Governor**                **Constitutional Basis**
1. Appointment of the Chief Minister      :   Article 164
2.  Dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly :  Article 174
3.  Grant of Pardons                       :   Article 161
4.  Recommendation of Bills for Presidential Assent    : Article 200
5.  Power to promulgate Ordinances         : Article 213


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. Article 164 deals with the appointment of the Chief Minister. Article 174 outlines the Governor's power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly. Article 161 grants the Governor the power of pardon. Article 200 describes the Governor's role in recommending bills for Presidential assent. Article 213 details the Governor's power to promulgate ordinances. The incorrect options are strategically designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the Governor's powers and their constitutional basis.  They include plausible but ultimately incorrect pairings to increase the question's difficulty.


**4. With reference to the Sarkaria Commission, consider the following pairs:**

   **Recommendation**                      **Area of Concern**
1. Establishment of an Inter-State Council:   Centre-State Relations
2.  Strengthening of Zila Parishads      :   Rural Development
3.  Review of the financial powers of the states:   Fiscal Federalism
4.  Amendment of Article 356             :   Emergency Provisions
5.  Emphasis on cooperative federalism   :   Inter-governmental relations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sarkaria Commission's recommendations covered a wide range of issues related to Centre-State relations.  While the commission did address rural development and fiscal federalism (making options (a) and (b) partially correct), its primary focus was on improving intergovernmental cooperation and streamlining emergency provisions.  The correct answer (c) highlights the commission's key recommendations on establishing an Inter-State Council, reviewing state financial powers, amending Article 356, and fostering cooperative federalism. Option (d) is a distractor, including a less central recommendation (strengthening Zila Parishads) to increase the difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Supreme Court Case**                 **Article 356 Interpretation**
1.  Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala :   Basic Structure Doctrine
2.  S.R. Bommai v. Union of India       :   Limits on the use of Article 356
3.  Minerva Mills v. Union of India     :   Judicial Review of Constitutional Amendments
4.  Golak Nath v. State of Punjab       :   Amendment of Fundamental Rights
5.  I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu   :   Judicial review of Constitutional amendments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two pairs are correctly matched.  The *S.R. Bommai* case significantly impacted the interpretation of Article 356, setting stricter limits on its application.  The *Kesavananda Bharati* case established the "basic structure doctrine," which has broader constitutional implications but is not directly related to the specifics of Article 356.  The other cases are related to constitutional law but are distractors in the context of Article 356 interpretation. The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between landmark Supreme Court judgments and their relevance to specific constitutional articles.  The inclusion of several significant cases related to constitutional law creates plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Established By
1.  Finance Commission                    :  Parliament
2.  Election Commission                   :  President
3.  Inter-State Council                   :  President
4.  National Judicial Appointments Commission: Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission and the Inter-State Council are both established by the President of India, as per Articles 324 and 263 of the Constitution, respectively.  The Finance Commission is established by the President under Article 280, but its composition and powers are defined by Parliament.  The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) was established by the 99th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2014,  but it was later struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. Thus, the NJAC is not a currently functioning constitutional body. Option (a) is incorrect because the Finance Commission is not established solely by Parliament.  Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes the Inter-State Council, neglecting the correctly matched Election Commission. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the NJAC, which is not a currently functioning constitutional body, and incorrectly attributes the establishment of the Finance Commission to Parliament.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Principle                  Upholding Institution
1.  Supremacy of the Constitution          :   High Courts
2.  Rule of Law                              :   Supreme Court
3.  Separation of Powers                     :   Parliament
4.  Federalism                               :  President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The High Courts and the Supreme Court uphold the supremacy of the Constitution through judicial review. The Supreme Court also acts as a guardian of the Rule of Law.  Parliament plays a crucial role in upholding the separation of powers through its legislative functions. However, the principle of federalism itself is enshrined in the Constitution, not upheld by any single institution.  The President, while playing an important role in the federal structure, doesn't solely "uphold" federalism; it's a system established and maintained through the interplay of various constitutional bodies and principles.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or incorrectly attribute the upholding of federalism to the President.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Type                        Characteristic
1.  Unitary Government                     :   Distribution of power between Centre and States
2.  Federal Government                     :   Single Citizenship
3.  Parliamentary Government              :   Head of State separate from Head of Government
4.  Presidential Government               :   Head of State is also Head of Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only the pair relating to Presidential Government and its characteristic is correctly matched. A presidential government is characterized by a Head of State who is also the Head of Government. Option (a) is partially correct, as statement 4 is correct, but statement 3 is incorrect, as in a parliamentary government the Head of State is generally separate from the Head of Government. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the characteristics of unitary and federal governments.  A unitary government does not inherently involve a distribution of power between the Centre and States;  a federal government does not inherently involve single citizenship (although it can be a feature).


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                 Zonal Council
1.  Uttarakhand                            :   Northern Zonal Council
2.  Uttar Pradesh                          :   Central Zonal Council
3.  Haryana                                 :   Northern Zonal Council
4.  Punjab                                  :   Western Zonal Council
5.  Rajasthan                               :   Central Zonal Council


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Punjab are all included in the Northern Zonal Council.  Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan belong to the Central Zonal Council. Option (a) is incorrect because Rajasthan is in the Central Zonal Council. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits Punjab. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly places Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan in the Northern Zonal Council.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commission on Centre-State Relations     Recommendation
1.  Punchhi Commission                     :   Disposal of a reserved bill within four months
2.  Sarkaria Commission                   :   Guidelines for Governor's appointment
3.  Rajamannar Commission                 :   Establishment of the Inter-State Council


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Sarkaria Commission provided guidelines for the appointment of Governors, and the Rajamannar Commission recommended the establishment of the Inter-State Council. The Punchhi Commission recommended a time limit for the disposal of a reserved bill, but this time limit was not four months, rather it suggested that the six-month time limit applicable to state legislatures should also be applied to the President's decision on state bills.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Punchhi Commission's recommendation regarding the time limit for reserved bills differs from the statement. Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the Sarkaria Commission's correctly matched pair. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy in the Punchhi Commission's recommendation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Provision Related To
1. Article 263                       : Establishment of the Inter-State Council
2. Article 370                       : Special status of Jammu and Kashmir (now repealed)
3. Article 324                       : Election Commission of India
4. Article 280                       : Appointment of the Finance Commission
5. Article 112                       : Annual Financial Statement (Union Budget)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 263 of the Indian Constitution explicitly empowers the President to establish the Inter-State Council for resolving disputes and coordinating policies between states.  Article 324 deals with the Election Commission.  Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to advise on financial matters between the Union and the States. Article 112 pertains to the Annual Financial Statement, which is the Union Budget.  Article 370, formerly granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir, has been repealed. Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of the constitutional provisions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                     Function/Responsibility
1. Inter-State Council                 :  Management of inter-state river water disputes
2. Goods and Services Tax Council      :  Determination of GST rates
3. NITI Aayog                          :  Formulation of five-year plans (previously Planning Commission's role)
4. Finance Commission                  :  Distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States
5. Election Commission of India         :  Conducting elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Inter-State Council, established under Article 263, addresses inter-state disputes, including those related to water. The GST Council determines GST rates and other related matters. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of tax revenues. The Election Commission conducts elections. NITI Aayog, unlike the Planning Commission it replaced, does not formulate five-year plans; its role is more advisory and developmental. The inclusion of incorrect information regarding NITI Aayog's function acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's in-depth knowledge of the subject.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                  Chairman/Head
1. Inter-State Council               :  Union Home Minister
2. Goods and Services Tax Council    :  Union Finance Minister
3. NITI Aayog                        :  Prime Minister
4. Finance Commission                :  President of India appoints the chairman
5. Election Commission of India       :  Chief Election Commissioner


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Union Home Minister heads the Inter-State Council. The Prime Minister chairs NITI Aayog.  The Chief Election Commissioner heads the Election Commission.  The President appoints the Chairman of the Finance Commission, and the Union Finance Minister chairs the GST Council. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, specifically concerning the heads of the Finance Commission and GST Council, requiring candidates to possess precise knowledge of the organizational structures.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Committee                Key Recommendation
1. Sarkaria Commission                 :  Strengthening the Inter-State Council
2. Rajamannar Committee               :  Creation of Zonal Councils
3. L.M. Singhvi Committee            :  Amendment to the Constitution regarding the office of the Speaker
4. Punchhi Commission                  :  Review of Centre-State relations
5. Administrative Reforms Commission :  Recommendations on streamlining governance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Sarkaria Commission focused on improving Centre-State relations, including the Inter-State Council's role.  The Punchhi Commission also dealt with Centre-State relations. The Administrative Reforms Commission offered various recommendations on governance. The Rajamannar Committee and L.M. Singhvi Committee recommendations are not accurately reflected in the options provided. The distractors use names of real committees but misrepresent their recommendations. This tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between various committees and their specific contributions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Article                  Subject Matter
1. Article 263                    :  Establishment of Zonal Councils
2. Article 300                    :  Suits and Proceedings against the Union and States
3. Article 291                     :  Grants to the States
4. Article 123                    :  President's Ordinance-making power
5. Article 253                     :  Parliament's power to legislate on matters in the State List


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 300 deals with the legal personality of the Union and States and the ability to sue them. Article 123 outlines the President's power to issue ordinances. Article 253 permits Parliament to make laws on State List subjects in national interest. Article 263 concerns the Inter-State Council, not Zonal Councils. Article 291 does not solely deal with grants to states.  The incorrect pairings are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of constitutional provisions and their scope.  The options present a challenge by providing plausible but incorrect alternatives.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                      Provision Related to Fundamental Duties
1. Article 32                   :  Enforcement of Fundamental Rights
2. Article 51A                  :  Definition of Fundamental Duties
3. Article 14                   :  Equality before the law
4. Article 368                  :  Amendment of the Constitution
5. Article 21                   :  Protection of life and personal liberty


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Article 51A of the Indian Constitution explicitly outlines the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens.  Articles 32 and 21 are related to Fundamental Rights, not Fundamental Duties. Article 14 pertains to the Right to Equality, a Fundamental Right. Article 368 deals with the process of Constitutional amendments, which can affect both Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Duties but doesn't define them.  The other options incorrectly link Fundamental Duties to articles primarily associated with Fundamental Rights or Constitutional amendment procedures.  Understanding the distinct roles of each article is crucial for accurately matching them to their respective constitutional provisions.  Fundamental Duties, unlike Fundamental Rights, are not justiciable, meaning they cannot be directly enforced by courts.  They serve as moral guidelines for citizens to uphold the nation's values and integrity.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act           Impact on Fundamental Rights
1. 1st Amendment                          :  Curtailed freedom of speech
2. 42nd Amendment                         :  Added Fundamental Duties
3. 44th Amendment                         :  Removed right to property
4. 86th Amendment                        :  Added right to education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties to Part IV-A of the Constitution, significantly impacting the balance between Fundamental Rights and Duties.  The 44th Amendment Act removed the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights, reclassifying it as a legal right. While the 1st Amendment did make changes related to freedom of speech, its primary aim wasn't to curtail it but rather to address concerns about certain limitations on it.  The 86th Amendment added the right to education to the Fundamental Rights. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the impact of the constitutional amendments on fundamental rights.  The correct answer accurately reflects the significant changes in the constitutional framework relating to fundamental rights brought about by the 42nd and 44th amendments.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                     Characteristic
1. Fundamental Rights                 :  Not enforceable by courts
2. Directive Principles                :  Justiciable in nature
3. Fundamental Duties                  :  Non-justiciable in nature
4. Basic Structure Doctrine           :  Judicial review of amendments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Fundamental Duties are non-justiciable, meaning they are not enforceable by courts.  They serve as aspirational goals for citizens. Fundamental Rights, conversely, are justiciable and enforceable through the courts. Directive Principles, while not directly justiciable, guide the state in policymaking. The Basic Structure Doctrine, established through judicial precedent, limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly characterize the nature of Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles, or Basic Structure. The distinction between justiciable and non-justiciable provisions is critical in understanding the Indian constitutional framework.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                  Source of Inspiration
1. Fundamental Rights              :  American Bill of Rights
2. Directive Principles             :  Irish Constitution
3. Fundamental Duties               :  USSR Constitution
4. Basic Structure Doctrine        :  German Basic Law


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Directive Principles of State Policy in the Indian Constitution drew inspiration from the Irish Constitution.  The Fundamental Duties were significantly influenced by the USSR Constitution.  While the Indian Constitution's Fundamental Rights were indeed influenced by the American Bill of Rights, the direct mapping is not as straightforward as the other pairs. The Basic Structure Doctrine is a unique Indian judicial creation, not directly borrowed from any specific foreign constitution.  Options (a), (c), and (d) thus contain incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the origins of various constitutional provisions in India.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body             Function
1. Finance Commission              :  Recommends principles governing distribution of financial resources between Union and States
2. Election Commission             :  Conducts elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures
3. Attorney General of India     :  Advises the President on legal matters
4. Comptroller and Auditor General :  Audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in India's federal financial system by recommending the distribution of financial resources. The Election Commission conducts free and fair elections. The Attorney General provides legal advice to the government.  The Comptroller and Auditor General audits government accounts.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  A complete understanding of the roles and responsibilities of these constitutional bodies is essential for effective governance and democratic functioning in India.  The independence and impartiality of these bodies are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                     Legislative Procedure
1. Money Bill                        :  Originates in Rajya Sabha
2. Ordinary Bill                     :  Passed by a simple majority in both houses
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill    :  Requires special majority in both houses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Ordinary Bills are passed by a simple majority in both houses of Parliament. Constitutional Amendment Bills require a special majority in both houses.  A Money Bill originates in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, making option 1 incorrect.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the incorrectly matched pair. Option (b) is incorrect as it only contains the correctly matched pair for ordinary bills. Therefore, only (c) accurately reflects the legislative procedures for ordinary and constitutional amendment bills.  The difference in the required majorities reflects the varying significance of the types of bills.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Emergency Provision               Power Granted
1. National Emergency                :  President can suspend Fundamental Rights (except Articles 20 and 21)
2. President's Rule                   :  President's rule can be imposed by the President on recommendation of the Prime Minister
3. Financial Emergency               :  President can issue directions to states regarding financial matters


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  During a National Emergency, the President has the power to suspend some Fundamental Rights.  President's Rule (Article 356) is imposed by the President on the advice of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister). A Financial Emergency (Article 360) allows the President to issue directions to states regarding financial matters.  All options except (c) are incorrect because they do not include all three correctly matched pairs.  A thorough understanding of each emergency provision and the associated powers is essential for comprehending the Indian Constitution's framework for dealing with national crises and maintaining stability.  The limitations on these powers are also critical to understanding the balance between executive power and democratic safeguards.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Court                     Jurisdiction Regarding Fundamental Rights
1. Supreme Court              :  Original jurisdiction under Article 32
2. High Courts                 :  Appellate jurisdiction under Article 226
3. District Courts              :  Original jurisdiction in cases involving violation of Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights under Article 32. High Courts have the power to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights under Article 226. District Courts do not have inherent jurisdiction to handle Fundamental Rights violations directly; they would usually handle cases related to the violations of Fundamental Rights as part of their broader civil or criminal jurisdiction.  Therefore, option 3 is incorrect. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude a correct pairing or include an incorrect one.  This question tests the understanding of the hierarchical structure of the Indian judicial system and the distinct powers of different courts in relation to Fundamental Rights.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Rights             Articles in the Indian Constitution
1. Right to Equality             : Articles 14 to 18
2. Right to Freedom              : Articles 19 to 22
3. Right against Exploitation   : Articles 23 and 24
4. Right to Freedom of Religion : Articles 25 to 28


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Indian Constitution groups Fundamental Rights into distinct categories, each covered by specific articles.  The Right to Equality is defined in Articles 14-18; Right to Freedom in Articles 19-22; Right against Exploitation in Articles 23 and 24; and Right to Freedom of Religion in Articles 25-28. All other options are incorrect since they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the ability to recall and correctly associate the different categories of Fundamental Rights with their corresponding articles in the Constitution.  This knowledge is crucial for understanding the scope and extent of these rights.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                   Key Feature
1. 1st Amendment                  :  Added the Ninth Schedule
2. 42nd Amendment                 :  Added the Fundamental Duties
3. 44th Amendment                 :  Reinstated the right to property as a Fundamental Right
4. 86th Amendment                 :  Added the right to education as a Fundamental Right



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The 42nd Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 86th Amendment Act added the right to education to the Fundamental Rights.  The 1st Amendment did not add the Ninth Schedule; it was added by the First Constitutional Amendment Act of 1951. The 44th Amendment Act removed, not reinstated, the right to property from being a Fundamental Right. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one incorrectly matched pair.  This question assesses the knowledge of important Constitutional Amendment Acts and their specific impacts on the Indian legal framework.  Understanding the historical context of these amendments is crucial for a comprehensive grasp of the Constitution's evolution.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test deep understanding of the Indian Constitution.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Right Guaranteed/Principle Addressed
1. Article 14                      : Right to form cooperatives
2. Article 19                      : Protection of life and personal liberty
3. Article 21                      : Right to freedom of religion
4. Article 25                      : Right to equality before the law
5. Article 51A                     : Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. Article 51A of the Indian Constitution outlines the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens.  Let's examine the incorrect pairs:

* **Pair 1:** Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, not the right to form cooperatives.  The right to form cooperatives is indirectly related through the right to form associations (Article 19), but not directly under Article 14.

* **Pair 2:** Article 19 deals with the right to freedom, encompassing speech, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession.  The protection of life and personal liberty is primarily enshrined in Article 21.

* **Pair 3:** Article 21 protects the right to life and personal liberty, a broad right encompassing many aspects of individual freedom.  Freedom of religion is specifically covered under Article 25.

* **Pair 4:** Article 25 guarantees the freedom of conscience and the free profession, practice, and propagation of religion.  The right to equality before the law is found in Article 14.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act     Specific Amendment Related to Article 19
1. 42nd Amendment                  :  Removal of right to property
2. 44th Amendment                  :  Reinstatement of right to property
3. 97th Amendment                  :  Inclusion of right to education
4. 86th Amendment                  : Addition of right to form cooperatives


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  

* **Pair 1:** The 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, removed the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights (Article 31) effectively curtailing the ability to challenge state action affecting that right, influencing interpretations of Article 19's related freedoms.

* **Pair 4:** The 97th Amendment Act, 2011, added the right to form cooperative societies to Article 19, expanding the scope of the right to freedom.

The other pairs are incorrect: The 44th Amendment did not reinstate the right to property as a Fundamental Right; it was made a Constitutional Right. The 86th Amendment did not impact Article 19 directly; it primarily dealt with education.


**3. With reference to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept Included in Article 21              Judicial Interpretation/Landmark Case
1. Right to Privacy                         :  Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India
2. Right to Education                       :  Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh
3. Right to Livelihood                       :  Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation
4. Right to a Healthy Environment           :  Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar
5.  Procedure Established by Law            :  Gopalan v. State of Madras


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Article 21's broad interpretation by the Supreme Court has encompassed several rights:

* **Pair 1:**  *Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India* established the right to privacy as an intrinsic part of Article 21.

* **Pair 2:** *Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh* recognized the right to education as a part of Article 21.

* **Pair 3:** *Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation* affirmed the right to livelihood as a facet of Article 21.

* **Pair 4:**  The right to a healthy environment has been consistently upheld by the courts as integral to the right to life under Article 21, with cases like *Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar* contributing to this jurisprudence.

* **Pair 5:** *Gopalan v. State of Madras* initially provided a narrow interpretation of "procedure established by law", but subsequent cases have significantly broadened the scope of Article 21, moving away from the *Gopalan* interpretation.  Therefore, while historically significant, it doesn't accurately reflect the current understanding of Article 21 in relation to "procedure established by law."


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article         Key Feature/Associated Concept
1. Article 17                       :  Protection of interests of minorities
2. Article 24                       :  Prohibition of child labour
3. Article 29                       :  Abolition of untouchability
4. Article 30                       : Right to establish and administer educational institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Article 24 of the Constitution prohibits the employment of children in hazardous industries.

* **Pair 1:** Article 17 abolishes untouchability;  the protection of minority interests is addressed in Article 29.

* **Pair 3:** Article 29 protects the language, script, and culture of minorities; the abolition of untouchability is the subject of Article 17.

* **Pair 4:** Article 30 grants minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions.


**5. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), consider the following pairs:**

   Article Number                      Specific Directive
1. Article 39 (b)                     :  Equal pay for equal work
2. Article 40                        :  Organization of village panchayats
3. Article 41                        :  Right to work
4. Article 43                       :  Living wage and conditions of work for workers
5. Article 46                       :  Protection of weaker sections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the directives contained within the respective articles.  Let's analyze:

* **Pair 2:** Article 40 directs the state to organize village panchayats.

* **Pair 3:** Article 41 aims to secure the right to work, to education, and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness, and disablement.

* **Pair 4:** Article 43 advocates for living wages, a decent standard of life, and a fair distribution of the national wealth and resources.

* **Pair 5:** Article 46 focuses on the educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other weaker sections.

* **Pair 1:** Article 39(b) deals with the prevention of concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment; equal pay for equal work is not explicitly mentioned in this article, although the spirit might be related to its broader aims.  This makes it a plausible distractor, testing detailed knowledge of DPSP.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                     Function Related to Elections
1. Election Commission of India     :   Delimits constituencies
2. Union Ministry of Law and Justice :   Decides election schedule
3.  Supreme Court of India           :   Resolves disputes regarding election petitions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 1:** The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for delimiting constituencies based on population data.

* **Pair 3:** The Supreme Court of India has the power to hear and decide election petitions, resolving disputes related to elections.

* **Pair 2:** The Union Ministry of Law and Justice does not decide the election schedule. This is the responsibility of the Election Commission of India. This is a key distractor, highlighting the importance of knowing the exact responsibilities of different government bodies.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Power/Function
1. Article 356                       :  Imposition of President's Rule
2. Article 358                       : Suspension of certain Fundamental Rights during National Emergency
3. Article 360                       :  Declaration of Financial Emergency

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  These articles deal with key aspects of the Indian Constitution's emergency provisions and the functioning of the executive:

* **Pair 1:** Article 356 empowers the President to impose President's Rule in a state if the state government cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.

* **Pair 2:** Article 358 deals with the suspension of certain Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency.

* **Pair 3:** Article 360 enables the President to declare a Financial Emergency if there is a threat to the financial stability of the nation.

* **Pair 4:** Article 74 establishes the Council of Ministers and its advisory role to the President.  The President is bound by this advice except in certain cases.




**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept                      Associated Constitutional Article
1.  Right to Equality                   : Article 21
2.  Right to Freedom                    : Article 19
3.  Right against Exploitation           : Article 23 and 24

5.  Right to Property                   : Article 300A


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 2:** Article 19 guarantees the right to freedom, including speech, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession.

* **Pair 3:** Articles 23 and 24 deal with the right against exploitation, prohibiting forced labor and child labor.

* **Pair 4:** Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, allowing citizens to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of their fundamental rights.

* **Pair 5:** Article 300A, added by the 44th Amendment, guarantees the right to property as a Constitutional right, though not a fundamental right.

* **Pair 1:** Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty; the right to equality is primarily dealt with in Article 14.  This is a deliberate distractor, testing the precise understanding of the articles.


These questions comprehensively cover the target content, offering a challenging assessment of knowledge of the Indian Constitution.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test not just recall, but also analytical and evaluative skills.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Associated Fundamental Right
1. Article 19(1)                     : Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression
2. Article 21                        : Right to Education
3. Article 32                        : Right to Constitutional Remedies
4. Article 14                        : Right to Equality before Law
5. Article 17                       : Abolition of Untouchability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression, which is a fundamental right.  Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, providing a mechanism for citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. Article 14 ensures equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Article 17 abolishes untouchability.  Option (a) is incorrect because Article 21, while encompassing the right to life, doesn't explicitly define the right to education. The right to education was later added as a fundamental right through a constitutional amendment.  Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason as option (a); Article 21 doesn't explicitly state the right to education in its original form. Option (c) is the most accurate, encompassing all the correctly matched pairs.  The UPSC often tests the precise knowledge of constitutional articles and their associated rights, making this a crucial aspect for understanding the Indian legal framework.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Right                       Specific Provision
1. Right to Property                 :  Article 300A
2. Right against Exploitation      :  Prohibition of Child Labour
3. Right to Freedom of Religion    :  Freedom to manage religious affairs
4. Right to Constitutional Remedies:  Article 32
5. Right to Equality                :  Article 15

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Right against Exploitation, enshrined in Part III of the Indian Constitution, explicitly includes the prohibition of child labour. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, allowing citizens to approach the Supreme Court to enforce their fundamental rights.  The right to equality is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 15, prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. Option (a) is incorrect because the right to property is no longer a fundamental right but a constitutional right under Article 300A. Option (c) is partially correct, but it omits the correct matching of the Right against Exploitation with child labour prohibition. Option (d) is incomplete, missing the correct pairings of articles with their corresponding rights. Option (b) correctly identifies the relationship between the legal rights and their constitutional provisions.  The UPSC frequently tests knowledge of the constitutional framework and the different types of rights, making understanding the specifics of these articles crucial.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment    Key Provision Added/Amended
1. 42nd Amendment              :  Inclusion of Fundamental Duties
2. 86th Amendment              :  Right to Education as a Fundamental Right
3. 1st Amendment               :  Amendment related to Article 19
4. 44th Amendment              :  Removal of Right to Property as a Fundamental Right
5. 73rd Amendment              :  Provisions for Panchayati Raj Institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment to the Indian Constitution introduced Fundamental Duties, a significant addition to the citizen's obligations. The 44th Amendment removed the right to property as a fundamental right, transforming it into a legal right. The 73rd Amendment introduced provisions related to Panchayati Raj Institutions, aiming at decentralizing power to local governance bodies.  Option (b) is incorrect as it omits the correct matching of the 73rd and 5th amendment. Option (c) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because the 86th Amendment added the right to education as a fundamental right, not the 2nd Amendment. Option (a) accurately reflects the key provisions added or amended by the listed constitutional amendments. The UPSC frequently tests knowledge of constitutional amendments and their impact, making a clear understanding of these crucial changes essential for success.


**4. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Principle                                  Article Number
1.  Equal pay for equal work for both men and women   :   Article 43
2.  Organisation of village panchayats                      :   Article 40
3.  Securing a living wage, decent standard of life        :   Article 43
4.  Right to work, education and public assistance       :   Article 41
5.  Provision for just and humane conditions of work      :   Article 42

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 40 of the Indian Constitution mandates the organization of village panchayats to function as units of self-government. Article 41 directs the state to secure the right to work, education, and public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness, and disablement. Article 42 aims at securing just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief. Option (a) is incorrect because equal pay for equal work for both men and women is mentioned in Article 39(d), not Article 43. Option (c) incorrectly includes the pairing of equal pay with Article 43. Option (d) is also incorrect due to the same reason.  Option (b) provides the most accurate matching of the principles with their corresponding article numbers.  The UPSC frequently tests the knowledge of the Directive Principles and their content, thereby making a thorough understanding of these articles crucial for effective analysis.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                 Constitutional Provision
1.  Fundamental Duties                      : Article 51A
2.  Right to Education                       :  Article 21A
3.  Abolition of Untouchability             : Article 17
4.  Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression: Article 19(1)(a)
5.  Right to Constitutional Remedies          : Article 32

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 51A of the Indian Constitution outlines the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens. Article 21A, added through the 86th Amendment, guarantees the right to education. Article 17 abolishes the practice of untouchability. Article 19(1)(a) grants the right to freedom of speech and expression. Article 32 ensures the right to constitutional remedies.  All the pairs given are correctly matched. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  The UPSC exam often tests detailed knowledge of the Indian Constitution's articles and their corresponding rights and duties, underscoring the importance of thorough preparation in this area.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Rights, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the difficulty is inherent in the need for precise factual recall and the inclusion of plausible, yet incorrect, distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article Number      Directive Principle Focus
1. Article 40            :   Organization of village panchayats
2. Article 44            :   Securing a uniform civil code for citizens
3. Article 48A          :   Protection and improvement of environment and safeguarding of forests and wildlife
4. Article 47            :   Raising the level of nutrition and the standard of living and improving public health
5. Article 39             :   Equal pay for equal work for both men and women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Articles 40, 44, and 47 accurately reflect the Directive Principles outlined in the Indian Constitution.  Article 40 deals with the organization of village panchayats, a key element of Gandhian philosophy and decentralized governance. Article 44 advocates for a uniform civil code, aiming for legal uniformity across diverse communities. Article 47 focuses on improving public health and the standard of living, aligning with broader social welfare goals.  Option (a) incorrectly includes Article 3, which is related to environmental protection, and while important for welfare, it’s not the primary focus of the articles listed. Option (c) incorrectly pairs Article 39 with equal pay for men and women; while related to social justice, the principle of equal pay is found elsewhere in the Directive Principles. Option (d) is incorrect as it combines inaccurate pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment     Provision Related To
1. 42nd Amendment            :   Insertion of Fundamental Duties
2. 44th Amendment            :   Removal of Right to Property as a Fundamental Right
3. 61st Amendment            :   Reduction of voting age to 18 years
4. 73rd Amendment            :   Establishment of District Planning Committees
5. 74th Amendment            :   Establishment of Metropolitan Planning Committees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The 42nd Amendment introduced Fundamental Duties into the Constitution.  The 44th Amendment removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights. The 61st Amendment lowered the voting age. The 73rd and 74th Amendments established Panchayati Raj Institutions and Metropolitan Planning Committees, respectively.  There are no incorrect pairings in option (d), making it the only correct option.  The other options present plausible but ultimately inaccurate combinations of amendments and their associated provisions.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Directive Principles of State Policy:**

1.  They are justiciable, meaning courts can enforce them.
2.  They aim to establish a welfare state.
3.  They were criticized by K.T. Shah during the Constituent Assembly debates.
4.  They are supplementary to Fundamental Rights.
5. They are enumerated in Part IV of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above are correct?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are accurate. The Directive Principles aim to create a welfare state, providing social and economic guidelines for the government. They supplement Fundamental Rights, offering a broader vision of societal well-being.  They are listed in Part IV of the Constitution. Statement 1 is incorrect; Directive Principles are non-justiciable, meaning courts cannot directly enforce them. Statement 3 is correct;  K.T. Shah, a member of the Constituent Assembly, voiced criticisms regarding the Directive Principles. Option (a) is the only option that accurately reflects the correct and incorrect statements.


**4. With reference to Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                       Characteristic
1. Fundamental Rights          :   Non-justiciable
2. Directive Principles          :   Justiciable
3. Fundamental Rights          :   Enforceable by courts
4. Directive Principles          :   Guide government policies
5. Fundamental Rights          :   Limit government actions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Options 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Fundamental Rights are enforceable by courts, Directive Principles guide government policies, and Fundamental Rights limit government actions. Option 1 is incorrectly matched because Fundamental Rights are justiciable, not non-justiciable. Option 2 is incorrectly matched because Directive Principles are non-justiciable, not justiciable. Option (d) accurately reflects the correct and incorrect pairings.  The other options present inaccurate pairings of concepts and their characteristics, highlighting the need for precise understanding of these constitutional provisions.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Right                                     Constitutional Provision
1. Right to Education                      :    Article 21A
2. Right to Constitutional Remedies         :    Article 32
3. Right to Freedom of Religion             :    Article 25
4. Right to Property (as a legal right)    :    Article 300A
5. Right against Exploitation                 :    Article 23

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Article 21A guarantees the Right to Education, Article 32 provides for Constitutional Remedies, Article 25 ensures Freedom of Religion, Article 300A defines the Right to Property (after its removal as a Fundamental Right), and Article 23 addresses the Right against Exploitation.  The other options offer incomplete or inaccurate pairings, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of the relevant constitutional articles.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                      Head's Appointment Method
1. Comptroller and Auditor General of India :  Appointed by the President of India
2. Election Commission of India             :  Appointed by the Prime Minister of India
3. Union Public Service Commission         :  Appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of a Committee
4. Finance Commission                       : Appointed by the President of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is appointed by the President of India, as per Article 148 of the Constitution.  The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) members are appointed by the President on the recommendation of a committee, ensuring their impartiality and expertise.  The Finance Commission is also appointed by the President.  However, the Election Commission of India (ECI) members are appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of incorrect information regarding the ECI’s appointment serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of constitutional provisions.  The question tests factual recall and analysis of constitutional processes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                 Subject Matter
1. Article 355                          :  Directive Principles of State Policy
2. Article 300A                         :  Right to Education
3. Article 342A                         :  Specification of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes
4. Article 350B                          :  Appointment of the Governor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 355 mandates the Union's duty to protect states against external aggression and internal disturbances.  Article 300A deals with the right to property, not education. Article 342A empowers the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes. Article 350B concerns the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities, not the Governor's appointment. The question uses plausible distractors by associating articles with related but incorrect subjects.  The correct answer requires precise knowledge of the Constitution's provisions.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of constitutional articles.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment to the Constitution      Provision Introduced/Amended
1. 42nd Amendment                       :  Fundamental Duties
2. 44th Amendment                       :  Abolition of Privy Purses
3. 93rd Amendment                       :  Right to Information
4. 102nd Amendment                     :  Right to Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 44th Amendment abolished privy purses. The 93rd Amendment dealt with reservation for SCs and STs in education and employment.  The Right to Education was introduced by a separate Act, not a constitutional amendment. The inclusion of the Right to Information and Right to Education as plausible distractors increases the difficulty level by testing the candidate's knowledge of specific amendments and their precise impacts. The question assesses factual recall and analysis of the effects of constitutional amendments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article of the Indian Constitution       Provision
1. Article 14 to Article 18                : Right to Freedom of Religion
2. Article 15 to Article 19                : Right to Equality
3. Article 25 to Article 28                : Right to Constitutional Remedies
4. Article 300A                           : Right to Property


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Articles 14 to 18 encompass the Right to Equality. Articles 25 to 28 deal with Freedom of Religion.  Articles 32 and following cover Constitutional Remedies.  Article 300A relates to the Right to Property.  The question cleverly mixes articles covering various fundamental rights to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the articles' scope.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the grouping of related constitutional articles.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Office Holder                                  Removal Process
1. Governor of a State                            : Impeachment by Parliament
2. Judge of a High Court                          :  Removal by the President on grounds of proven misbehavior or incapacity.
3. Comptroller and Auditor General of India       : Removal by the President on grounds of proven misbehavior or incapacity.
4. President of India                             :  Resignation or Impeachment by Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

High Court judges and the CAG can be removed by the President based on proven misbehavior or incapacity, requiring a resolution passed by both houses of Parliament. The President can be removed through impeachment. The Governor's removal is not through impeachment by Parliament but by the President.  This question incorporates several plausible distractors concerning the removal procedures of high-ranking officials. The question evaluates the candidate's knowledge of the specific removal processes for different constitutional office holders.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Fundamental Right Guaranteed
1. Article 14                     : Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression
2. Article 19(1)(a)                : Right to Equality before the Law
3. Article 21                     : Right to Protection of Life and Personal Liberty
4. Article 25                     : Right to Constitutional Remedies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Protection of Life and Personal Liberty. This is a fundamental right and a cornerstone of the Indian legal system, protecting individuals from arbitrary deprivation of life or liberty by the state.  The other options are incorrect. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Article 19(1)(a) guarantees freedom of speech and expression, subject to reasonable restrictions. Article 32 is the article that guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies, providing individuals the right to move to the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairing of Article 21 with the Right to Protection of Life and Personal Liberty. The other options incorrectly pair articles with rights they do not guarantee.  Understanding the specific scope and limitations of each fundamental right is crucial for UPSC preparation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment to the Constitution  Subject Matter Addressed
1. 13th Amendment              : Abolition of the Privy Council
2. 18th Amendment              :  Inclusion of Right to Education
3. 39th Amendment              :  Clarification of the definition of 'state'
4. 52nd Amendment              :  Amendment related to the Election of the President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 13th Amendment to the Constitution of India abolished the Privy Council's appellate jurisdiction over Indian courts.  The 39th Amendment clarified the definition of "state" in the context of fundamental rights. The 52nd Amendment introduced significant changes to the process of electing the President of India. The 86th Amendment Act, 2002, introduced the Right to Education as a Fundamental Right. Option (d) correctly matches these amendments with their respective subjects. Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete. Options (b) and (c) are incorrect because they contain mismatched pairs. A comprehensive understanding of constitutional amendments is vital for success in the UPSC examination.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Law                                 Basis in the Constitution
1. Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878 : Article 29
2. Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904 : Article 25
3. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947 : Directive Principles of State Policy
4. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act, 1951 :  Article 25
5. Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972 : Article 29

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Constitution of India does not directly specify the legal basis for the acts listed. While these acts relate to cultural preservation and national heritage, they are enacted under the general powers of the Parliament to make laws for the peace and good government of the country. Article 29 deals with protection of interests of minorities, and Article 25 deals with freedom of religion, neither of which directly form the constitutional basis for these specific acts related to preservation of antiquities and treasures. The Directive Principles of State Policy, while guiding the state in promoting welfare, don't specifically mandate these acts.  The correct answer highlights the need to understand the broader constitutional framework under which laws are enacted, rather than seeking a direct, explicit correlation with specific articles.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Fundamental Right                  Classification
1. Right to Freedom of Religion     : Right against Exploitation
2. Prohibition of discrimination on the ground of religion etc. (Article 15) : Right to Equality
3. Right to Education                 : Right to Freedom of Religion
4. Cultural and Educational Rights    : Cultural and Educational Rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct pairings are 2 and 4. Article 15, prohibiting discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth, falls under the Right to Equality.  Cultural and Educational Rights are a distinct category of Fundamental Rights. Options 1 and 3 are incorrect. The Right to Freedom of Religion is a separate Fundamental Right and does not encompass the Right to Education. The Right to Education is categorized under Fundamental Rights, but it is not considered a part of Right to Freedom of Religion. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the classification of Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution.  A thorough understanding of the nuances of each right is crucial for a correct answer.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Concept               Implication
1. Basic Structure Theory              : Fundamental Rights cannot be amended.
2.  Amendment Procedure (Article 368) : The Preamble cannot be amended.
3. Freedom of Newspapers in India     : Specifically provided in Article 19(1)(a).
4. Fundamental Duties                   : Includes protecting and improving the natural environment.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Protecting and improving the natural environment is indeed a fundamental duty as enshrined in Article 51A of the Indian Constitution. The other options present incorrect implications. The basic structure doctrine implies that certain essential features of the Constitution cannot be altered through amendments, but it doesn't mean that Fundamental Rights are entirely unamendable.  The amendment procedure under Article 368 allows for amendments to the Preamble. The freedom of newspapers is implied within the wider freedom of expression (Article 19(1)(a)), not specifically stated. This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between the implications of various constitutional concepts.  A deep understanding of these concepts is necessary to avoid the plausible distractors in the options.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Feature of the Constitution of India     Description
1.  Federal System                         :  Single Citizenship
2.  Directive Principles of State Policy    : Legally enforceable
3.  Fundamental Rights                     :  Includes Right to Education
4.  Article 25                             : Guarantees Freedom of Religion
5.  Eighth Schedule                        :  Contains 22 languages

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Right to Education is indeed included among the Fundamental Rights (Article 21A), and Article 25 guarantees the freedom of religion. The other options are incorrect. India has a single citizenship, not multiple citizenships as a feature of its federal system. Directive Principles are not legally enforceable, though they serve as guidelines for the state. The Eighth Schedule lists 22 languages, but it is not the sole defining feature of the Schedule.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the key features of the Indian Constitution and their accurate description.  The close relationship between the correct and incorrect options presents a challenge, requiring precise knowledge.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                      Definition/Characteristic
1. High Courts                             : Defined in the Constitution of India
2. Election Commission of India           : Five-member body
3. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) : Upholds the Constitution of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

High Courts are defined in the Constitution of India, and the CAG plays a crucial role in upholding the Constitution's financial accountability provisions. The Election Commission of India is a body consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and such number of other Election Commissioners as the President may from time to time fix. Therefore, it's not necessarily a five-member body.  Option (b) correctly identifies the accurate pairs. Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete. Options (c) and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccurate description of the Election Commission. This question tests knowledge of key constitutional bodies and their characteristics.  Candidates need to know the exact composition and functions of these institutions to answer correctly.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body              Power or Function
1. Lok Sabha                      : Appoints the Prime Minister
2. Rajya Sabha                     : Conducts elections for Lok Sabha
3. State Legislatures               : Initiate constitutional amendments
4. President                       :  Dissolves Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched; the President of India has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Lok Sabha does not appoint the Prime Minister; the President appoints the leader of the party with a majority in the Lok Sabha as Prime Minister. The Election Commission of India conducts elections for the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. While State Legislatures participate in the amendment process, they do not initiate all amendments. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the powers and functions of different governmental bodies.  The distractors in the other options are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment       Specific Provision
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment :  Established Municipalities
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment : Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 86th Constitutional Amendment : Introduced Right to Education
4. 58th Constitutional Amendment : Introduced Anti-Defection Law

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002 introduced the Right to Education as a Fundamental Right, making it a legally enforceable right for children aged 6-14. The other pairings are incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act established Panchayati Raj institutions, and the 74th Amendment Act established Municipalities. The 52nd Amendment Act, 1985, introduced the anti-defection law.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific Constitutional Amendments and their impact.  Distractors are carefully chosen to challenge candidates who have only a superficial understanding of the subject.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Constitutional Amendment     Requirement for Passage
1. Amendment of Article 368          : Ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures
2. Amendment of Article 356          : Special majority in both Houses of Parliament
3. Amendment related to the Election of the President : Special majority in both Houses of Parliament and ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures
4. Amendment related to the Seventh Schedule : Special majority in both Houses of Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Amendments related to the election of the President require a special majority in both Houses of Parliament and ratification by at least half of the State Legislatures.  Other pairings are incorrect. Amending Article 368 itself requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament and ratification by half of the state legislatures.  Amendments to Article 356, related to the President's Rule, require a special majority in both Houses of Parliament.  Amendments related to the Seventh Schedule (distribution of powers between the Union and States) also require a special majority in both Houses of Parliament.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge about the different types of constitutional amendments and the procedures required for their passage.  The options are designed to test understanding of the nuances of the amendment process.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Provision/Concept
1. Article 30                          : Right to establish and administer educational institutions for religious minorities
2. Article 46                          :  Promotion of educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes
3. Article 43A                         : Worker participation in management of industries
4. Article 50                          : Separation of the judiciary from the executive
5. Article 51A(j)                      : Protection and improvement of the environment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 30 of the Indian Constitution grants minorities (religious or linguistic) the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.  Article 46 directs the state to promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, particularly Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Article 50 mandates the separation of the judiciary from the executive.  Article 43A, added by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act of 1976, deals with participation of workers in the management of industries.  Article 51A(j)  is part of Fundamental Duties and speaks to the protection and improvement of the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and having compassion for living creatures. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option 3 is incorrect as Article 43A is not about worker participation in the *management* of *industries* but rather about participation in the *management* of *enterprises*. Option 5 is incorrect as Article 51A(j) pertains to Fundamental Duties, not Directive Principles.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act       Significant Provision
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976         : Added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution
2. 61st Amendment Act, 1989         : Lowered the voting age to 18 years
3. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992         :  Provided constitutional status to Panchayati Raj Institutions
4. 76th Amendment Act, 2011          : Amendment related to Cooperative Societies
5. 86th Amendment Act, 2002          : Made free and compulsory education a fundamental right.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Indian Constitution, including the addition of Fundamental Duties (Article 51A). The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 provided constitutional recognition and status to Panchayati Raj institutions, enshrining them in Part IX of the Constitution. The 76th Amendment Act, 2011 added Article 43B to the Directive Principles of State Policy, dealing with the promotion of voluntary organisations and cooperative societies. The 86th Amendment Act of 2002 added Article 21A, guaranteeing free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years.  The 61st Amendment is incorrectly paired; it did not lower the voting age.  Therefore, only options 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                       Associated Constitutional Provision
1.  Basic Structure Doctrine          :  Keshvananda Bharati v. State of Kerala
2.  Directive Principles of State Policy: Articles 36-51
3.  Fundamental Duties                : Article 51A
4.  Right to Equality                  : Article 14
5.  Right to Freedom of Religion       : Article 25


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) All of the above
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) All of the above

**Explanation:**

The "Basic Structure Doctrine," a crucial concept in Indian constitutional law, was established by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of *Keshvananda Bharati v. State of Kerala*. Directive Principles of State Policy are outlined in Articles 36-51 of the Constitution. Fundamental Duties are enshrined in Article 51A. Article 14 guarantees the Right to Equality, while Article 25 protects the Right to Freedom of Religion.  All the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                    Primary Function
1. Union Public Service Commission  : Conducts examinations for All India Services
2. Comptroller and Auditor General   : Audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments
3. Election Commission of India      : Conducts elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures
4. Central Vigilance Commission      : Investigates corruption cases within the government
5. National Human Rights Commission : Protects and promotes human rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) All of the above
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) All of the above

**Explanation:**

The UPSC's primary role is recruiting personnel for All India Services and other central government positions through competitive examinations. The CAG audits government accounts to ensure financial accountability and transparency. The Election Commission conducts free and fair elections. The CVC investigates allegations of corruption within the government. The NHRC investigates human rights violations and makes recommendations for redressal.  All pairs accurately reflect the primary functions of these bodies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                      Characteristic Feature
1.  Fundamental Rights              :  Justiciable and enforceable in courts
2.  Directive Principles               :  Non-justiciable and not enforceable in courts
3.  Fundamental Duties               :  Moral obligations, not legally enforceable
4.  Writ Jurisdiction                  :  Part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution
5.  Emergency Provisions             :  Can suspend certain Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced in courts. Directive Principles, found in Part IV, are non-justiciable, guiding principles for the state. Fundamental Duties, added by the 42nd Amendment, are moral obligations, not legally enforceable. The Supreme Court has recognized writ jurisdiction as a fundamental aspect of the Basic Structure of the Constitution. Emergency provisions allow the government to temporarily suspend certain Fundamental Rights under specific circumstances.  All the given pairs accurately describe the characteristics of these legal concepts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure           Ideological Affiliation
1. Ram Manohar Lohia        :   Gandhian
2. Acharya Kripalani         :   Socialist
3. Jawaharlal Nehru          :   Liberal Intellectualistic

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru's political ideology is widely considered to be liberal intellectualistic, drawing from both Western liberal thought and Indian nationalism.  His approach emphasized social reform, democratic principles, and non-alignment in foreign policy, reflecting a blend of intellectualism and pragmatic liberalism.  Ram Manohar Lohia was a prominent socialist leader, known for his advocacy of socialist principles and critique of capitalism. Acharya Kripalani was a prominent follower of Gandhian philosophy and a key figure in the Indian National Congress.  Therefore, only the pairing of Jawaharlal Nehru with Liberal Intellectualistic is correct. The other options incorrectly associate Lohia and Kripalani with ideologies they did not primarily represent.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment     Primary Impact
1. 42nd Amendment             :   Lowered the voting age to 18
2. 38th Amendment             :   Added the word ‘Secular’ in the Preamble
3. 61st Amendment             :   Abolition of Right to Property as a Fundamental Right


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 38th Amendment Act, 1975, is correctly matched with the addition of the word "Secular" to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution.  The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Constitution, including the addition of the words "socialist" and "secular," and the enhancement of the Directive Principles of State Policy; it did not, however, lower the voting age.  The 61st Amendment Act, 1989, dealt with the lowering of the voting age from 21 to 18 years. The abolition of the Right to Property as a fundamental right occurred with the 44th Amendment Act, 1978.  Therefore, only the pairing of the 38th Amendment with the addition of "Secular" is accurate. The other pairings misrepresent the effects of the amendments.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Document              Provision Related To
1. 42nd Amendment             :   Enhanced power of High Courts
2. 44th Amendment             :   Curtailed power of Parliament
3. 42nd Amendment             :   Excluded Right to Property from Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, is correctly paired with the exclusion of the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights. This amendment significantly altered the Constitution, impacting various articles and provisions. The 44th Amendment, 1978, restored some aspects of the Right to Property, not curtailing the power of Parliament. The 42nd Amendment didn't enhance the powers of High Courts, rather it altered the balance of power, primarily enhancing the powers of the Parliament.  Therefore, only the third pair accurately reflects the relationship between a legal document and its corresponding provision. The other options misrepresent the effects of the amendments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article       Specific Right Guaranteed
1. Article 19                  :   Right against exploitation
2. Article 21                  :   Right to freedom of religion
3. Article 25                  :   Protection of life and personal liberty


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.  Article 19 deals with the right to freedom, encompassing speech, assembly, etc., while Article 25 guarantees freedom of religion. The Right against exploitation is covered under Articles 23 and 24. Therefore, only the pairing of Article 21 with the protection of life and personal liberty is correct.  The other pairs incorrectly associate articles with rights they do not guarantee.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Document               Action Taken
1. 42nd Amendment             :   Repealed by Janata government
2. 44th Amendment             :   Removed Right to Property from Fundamental Rights
3.  Janata Government           :   Revived parts of 42nd Amendment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Janata government, after coming to power, partially repealed certain provisions of the 42nd Amendment Act.  The 44th Amendment Act, 1978, removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights and placed it under Article 300A as a legal right.  The Janata government did not revive *all* parts of the 42nd Amendment; it selectively repealed certain provisions deemed controversial.  Therefore, only the first pair correctly matches a legal document with the action taken concerning it. The other options are partially or entirely incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Article         Subject Matter
1. Article 16                   :   Abolition of Untouchability
2. Article 17                   :   Equality of opportunity in public employment
3. Article 18                   :   Abolition of titles


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 18 of the Constitution deals with the abolition of titles. Article 16 addresses equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, and Article 17 abolishes untouchability. The pairings in options (a) and (b) incorrectly swap the subject matter of Articles 16 and 17.  Therefore, only the correct pairing is option (c).


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article        Key Provision
1. Article 20                  :   No self-incrimination
2. Article 22                  :   Protection against arrest and detention
3. Article 32                  :   Right to constitutional remedies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 20 provides protection in respect of conviction for offenses, including the right against self-incrimination. Article 22 deals with protection against arrest and detention in certain cases. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.  All three pairs accurately reflect the key provisions of the respective articles.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                 Constitutional Location
1. Right to property              :   Part III
2. Fundamental Duties            :   Part IV-A
3. Directive Principles of State Policy : Part IV


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties are enshrined in Part IV-A of the Constitution, and Directive Principles of State Policy are found in Part IV.  The Right to Property was originally in Part III but was removed by the 44th Amendment Act and is now a legal right under Article 300A. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Article                  Associated Concept
1. Article 358                 :   Suspension of Article 19
2. Article 359                 :   Suspension of Article 21
3. Article 368                 :   Amendment Procedure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 358 deals with the suspension of certain rights under Article 19 during a national emergency.  Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. Article 359 deals with the suspension of the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III (Fundamental Rights) during an emergency, but not necessarily Article 21, which is usually considered a core right and has faced limitations only through judicial interpretation.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Amendment              Specific Change
1. 42nd Amendment             :   Added "Socialist" to Preamble
2. 44th Amendment             :   Redefined Right to Property
3. First Amendment Act of 1951 :   Limited Freedom of Speech


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment added "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble. The 44th Amendment Act, 1978, removed the Right to Property as a Fundamental Right and placed it as a constitutional right under Article 300A. The First Amendment Act of 1951 introduced certain reasonable restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and expression. All three pairs accurately reflect the specific changes introduced by the respective amendments.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                  Associated Right
1. Article 14                               :  Right to Equality
2. Article 19                               :  Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression
3. Article 21                               :  Right to Constitutional Remedies
4. Article 25                               :  Right to Property
5. Article 32                               :  Right to Life and Personal Liberty

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Article 19 guarantees six fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech and expression. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, enabling citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.  Article 25 deals with freedom of conscience and free profession, practice, and propagation of religion.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.  Pair 3 is incorrect as Article 21 is not the Right to Constitutional Remedies (that's Article 32). Pair 4 is incorrect because the Right to Property was a fundamental right under Article 31 but was later removed and made a legal right.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act          Provision Introduced/Amended
1. 42nd Amendment Act                    :  Fundamental Duties
2. 44th Amendment Act                    :  Abolition of privy purses
3. 73rd Amendment Act                    :  Establishment of Municipalities
4. 74th Amendment Act                    :  Establishment of Panchayats
5. 86th Amendment Act                    :  Right to Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added Part IVA to the Constitution, which enshrined Fundamental Duties. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 abolished privy purses. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats. The 74th Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX-A to the Constitution, dealing with Municipalities. The 86th Amendment Act of 2002 made the Right to Education a Fundamental Right. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched. Pairs 3 and 4 are incorrect because the 73rd and 74th amendments deal with Panchayats and Municipalities respectively, not the other way around.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Writ                                     Purpose
1. Habeas Corpus                           :  To secure the release of a person unlawfully detained.
2. Mandamus                               :  To compel a public authority to perform a statutory duty.
3. Prohibition                             :  To prevent a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction.
4. Certiorari                              :  To quash an order passed by a lower court.
5. Quo Warranto                           :  To challenge the right of a person to hold a public office.
6. Quo Warranto                            : To challenge the validity of a law


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Habeas corpus is used to secure the release of a person unlawfully detained. Mandamus compels a public authority to perform a statutory duty. Prohibition prevents a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction. Certiorari quashes an order passed by a lower court. Quo warranto challenges a person's right to hold a public office.  Pair 6 is incorrect; Quo Warranto does not challenge the validity of a law.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                 Description
1. Article 23                               :  Right to Education
2. Article 29                               :  Protection of interests of minorities
3. Article 30                               :  Right to constitutional remedies
4. Article 31                               :  Right to form associations or unions
5. Article 32                               : Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 29 protects the interests of minorities by safeguarding their right to conserve their distinct language, script, or culture.  Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour.  Article 30 grants minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions. Article 32 provides for the right to constitutional remedies.  Article 16 deals with equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The other pairs incorrectly associate articles with the wrong descriptions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   President's Rule Provision               Associated Article
1. Proclamation of Emergency              :  Article 352
2. President's Rule in a State             :  Article 356
3. Failure of Constitutional Machinery      :  Article 360
4. Financial Emergency                     :  Article 365
5. State Emergency                         : Article 358

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency. Article 356 deals with the imposition of President's Rule in a state. Article 360 deals with a Financial Emergency. Article 365 deals with the failure of a state to comply with the directions of the Union. Article 358 deals with the suspension of certain fundamental rights during a National Emergency, not a State Emergency, which is covered under Article 356. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Power                     Source
1. Power of Judicial Review                :  Article 142
2. Original Jurisdiction in disputes       :  Article 131
3. Advisory Jurisdiction                   :  Article 143
4. Power to issue writs                    :  Article 32
5. Enforcement of Fundamental Rights     : Article 141


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States, or between States, is derived from Article 131.  Its advisory jurisdiction, where it can advise the President on any question of law or fact, is based on Article 143.  Article 32 grants the Supreme Court the power to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. Article 141 declares the law declared by the Supreme Court to be binding on all courts within India. Article 142 does not specifically grant judicial review power; that power is inherent in the Supreme Court's role as the final interpreter of the Constitution. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4 and 5 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Caste/Tribe Provision         Article
1.  Special Provisions for SCs and STs   : Article 330
2.  Special Provisions for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha   : Article 332
3.  Special Provisions for SCs and STs in State Assemblies: Article 335
4.  Appointment of Special Officer for SCs and STs : Article 338
5.  Protection against Social Discrimination: Article 17

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Articles 330 and 332 deal with the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, respectively. Article 338 provides for the appointment of a Special Officer for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Article 335 directs that the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State. Article 17 abolishes untouchability.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 3 is incorrectly associated with a different provision. Pair 5 is also incorrect because Article 17 addresses untouchability, not general social discrimination.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fundamental Right                       Article
1. Right to Equality                        : Article 16

4. Right to Freedom of Religion             : Article 25
5. Cultural and Educational Rights         : Article 29
6. Right to Constitutional Remedies         : Article 32


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms (speech, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession). Article 23 prohibits exploitation, including forced labor and human trafficking. Article 25 guarantees freedom of conscience and religion. Article 29 protects cultural and educational rights of minorities.  Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Directive Principle                      Article
1.  Organising Village Panchayats        : Article 40
2.  Equal pay for equal work               : Article 39(d)
3.  Separation of Judiciary from Executive: Article 50
4.  Protection and Improvement of Environment: Article 48A
5.  Free and compulsory education         : Article 45

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 40 of the Directive Principles of State Policy directs the state to organize village panchayats. Article 39(d) advocates for equal pay for equal work. Article 50 emphasizes the separation of the judiciary from the executive. Article 48A directs the state to protect and improve the environment. Article 45 mandates free and compulsory education for children until they complete the age of 14 years.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fundamental Duty                         Article
1.  To abide by the Constitution           : Article 51A(a)
2.  To cherish and follow the noble ideals  : Article 51A(b)
3.  To uphold and protect the sovereignty  : Article 51A(c)
4.  To defend the country and render national service: Article 51A(d)
5.  To safeguard public property           : Article 51A(e)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 51A outlines the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens, and the pairs accurately link each duty to its corresponding clause within Article 51A.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                       Provision
1. Article 352                                   :   National Emergency

4. Article 365                                   :   Failure of a State to comply with Union directives

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency by the President on the grounds of war, external aggression, or armed rebellion. Article 356 empowers the President to impose President's Rule in a state if the constitutional machinery breaks down. Article 360 relates to the proclamation of a Financial Emergency, and Article 365 deals with the failure of a State government to comply with directions given by the Union government. All four pairs are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair. Option (b) omits Article 365, which is also correctly matched. Option (d) incorrectly pairs Article 356 and 365, ignoring the correct pairings of Articles 352 and 360.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act             Subject Matter
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976                 :   Inclusion of Fundamental Duties
2. 44th Amendment Act, 1978                 :   Abolition of right to property as a fundamental right
3. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992                 :   Establishment of Municipalities
4. 74th Amendment Act, 1992                 :   Establishment of Panchayats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights.  However, the 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts dealt with Panchayats and Municipalities respectively, not the other way around as suggested in options (c) and (d).  Option (a) is incomplete, only including one correct pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Characteristic
1.  President's Rule                         :   Applicable only to States
2.  National Emergency                      :   Can suspend Fundamental Rights (except Articles 20 & 21)
3.  Financial Emergency                     :   Affects the entire financial system of the country
4.  Fundamental Duties                       :   Non-justiciable in Courts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

President's Rule (Article 356) applies only to states facing a breakdown of constitutional machinery.  A National Emergency (Article 352) allows for the suspension of Fundamental Rights, with the exception of Articles 20 and 21 (protection against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy, and right to life). A Financial Emergency (Article 360) affects the entire financial system, impacting the states' and Union's financial resources. Fundamental Duties (Article 51A) are not justiciable, meaning courts cannot enforce them directly. All four pairs accurately reflect the characteristics of the given provisions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                     Power Granted
1. Article 358                                 :   Power to suspend Fundamental Rights during National Emergency
2. Article 359                                 :   Power to suspend Fundamental Rights (except Articles 20 and 21) during a National Emergency
3. Article 368                                 :   Power to amend the Constitution
4. Article 72                                 :   Power of President to grant pardons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 359 deals with the President's power to suspend the enforcement of Fundamental Rights (excluding Articles 20 and 21) during a National Emergency. Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. Article 72 grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or remit sentences. While Article 358 also relates to the suspension of certain Fundamental Rights during a proclaimed emergency, its scope is narrower than that of Article 359.  Option (a) is incorrect because Article 358's power is less extensive than Article 359's. Option (b) excludes Article 72, which is correctly matched. Option (d) incorrectly includes Article 358, which has a more limited scope compared to Article 359.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Act                              Key Feature
1.  Government of India Act, 1919             :   Dyarchy introduced in provinces
2.  Government of India Act, 1935             :   Establishment of Federal Court
3.  Indian Independence Act, 1947            :   Partition of India
4.  Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, 1918       :   Introduction of Provincial Autonomy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced Dyarchy (dual governance) in provinces. The Government of India Act, 1935, established the Federal Court. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, led to the partition of India. However, the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms are synonymous with the Government of India Act, 1919, and did not introduce full provincial autonomy.  Therefore, only three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, and option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracy related to the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms and Provincial Autonomy.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article Number           Provision Related To
1. Article 143               Advisory opinion from Supreme Court to the President
2. Article 350A              Safeguards for linguistic minorities
3. Article 352               Proclamation of Emergency
4. Article 72                Presidential pardon
5. Article 368               Amendment of the Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 143 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to consult the Supreme Court on any question of law or fact of public importance.  This is a correctly matched pair. Article 350A deals with the facilitation of the use of the mother tongue at the primary stage of education. This is also correctly matched.  Article 72 grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence. This is correctly matched. Article 352 relates to the proclamation of a national emergency, not directly related to Presidential powers in the way described in the other pairs. Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. While the President is involved in the amendment process, the pair doesn't accurately reflect a direct, singular relationship as seen in the other correctly matched pairs. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Power of the President     Source of Power
1.  Pocket Veto              Article 111
2.  Absolute Veto             Article 111
3.  Suspensive Veto          Article 111
4.  Grant Pardons             Article 72
5.  Appoint Governors        Article 155

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The President's veto power over legislation is derived from Article 111. While the President possesses the power of a pocket veto, absolute veto, and suspensive veto, the specific articles governing these are not explicitly mentioned in the constitution itself; they are implied powers.  Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, making this a correct match. Article 155 clearly states the President's power to appoint Governors, resulting in another correct match.  The other options incorrectly link the veto powers to Article 111 directly, which is an oversimplification. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body         Chairman Appointed By
1. Union Public Service Commission : Prime Minister
2. Election Commission          : President
3. Finance Commission           : President
4. National Human Rights Commission:  Prime Minister
5. National Commission for Scheduled Castes: President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India's Chief Election Commissioner is appointed by the President of India. The Chairman of the Finance Commission is also appointed by the President. The Chairperson of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes is appointed by the President.  The UPSC Chairman is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister. The Chairperson of the NHRC is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   President's Role          Article Reference
1.  Addressing Parliament    Article 87
2.  Appointing Judges to Supreme Court: Article 124
3.  Dissolving Lok Sabha     Article 85
4.  Presenting Union Budget  Article 112
5.  Nominating Rajya Sabha Members: Article 80

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 124 details the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court by the President. Article 85 grants the President the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha. Article 80 specifies the President's role in nominating members to the Rajya Sabha.  While the President addresses Parliament, the specific article isn't Article 87; it's implied by the President's role as Head of State. The President does not present the Union Budget; that is the responsibility of the Finance Minister.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are accurately matched to their respective constitutional articles.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment   Subject of Amendment
1. 73rd Amendment Act             :  Reservation of seats for SCs and STs in Panchayats
2. 74th Amendment Act             :  Reservation of seats for SCs and STs in Municipalities
3. 86th Amendment Act            :  Inclusion of Fundamental Rights
4. 101st Amendment Act           :  GST Council
5. 42nd Amendment Act             :  Inclusion of Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act deals with Panchayats and includes provisions for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The 74th Amendment Act similarly addresses Municipalities and their reservation policies. The 42nd Amendment Act is famously known for introducing Fundamental Duties into the Constitution. The 86th Amendment Act does not deal with Fundamental Rights.  The 101st Amendment Act deals with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, not the subjects listed in the other pairs. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   President's Power            Article Number
1.  To declare Financial Emergency: Article 360
2.  To promulgate Ordinances     : Article 123
3.  To address the joint sitting of Parliament: Article 108
4.  To seek advisory opinion from the Supreme Court: Article 143
5.  To appoint the Attorney General: Article 76

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 360 of the Constitution grants the President the power to declare a financial emergency. Article 123 allows the President to promulgate ordinances during parliamentary recesses. Article 143 permits the President to seek advisory opinions from the Supreme Court on questions of law or fact. Article 76 outlines the President's power to appoint the Attorney General for India. The President does not directly address a joint sitting of Parliament; that is part of the parliamentary procedure.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body          Appointment Authority
1. Comptroller and Auditor General of India: Parliament
2. Chief Election Commissioner    : President
3.  Finance Commission             : President
4.  Governor of a State             : President
5.  Judges of the Supreme Court     : President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Chief Election Commissioner, the members of the Finance Commission, the Governors of States, and the Judges of the Supreme Court are all appointed by the President of India. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India is appointed by the President, not by Parliament. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                    Special Majority Required
1. Ordinary Bill                   : No
2. Money Bill                      : No
3. Constitution Amendment Bill : Yes
4. Finance Bill                    : No
5. State Reorganisation Bill      : No

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Ordinary Bills do not require a special majority for passage.  Constitution Amendment Bills require a special majority (two-thirds majority of both Houses). Money Bills and Finance Bills do not require a special majority; they only need a simple majority in both houses. A State Reorganisation Bill also does not require a special majority.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution         Related Legal Concept
1. Article 51A                               :   Directive Principles of State Policy
2. Article 36 to 51                           :   Fundamental Rights
3. Article 14                                 :   Right to Equality
4. Part IV-A                                 :   Fundamental Duties
5. Part III                                  :   Directive Principles of State Policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Article 14 deals with the Right to Equality, which is a Fundamental Right, and Part IV-A of the Constitution of India contains the Fundamental Duties.  The other options are incorrect due to mismatched pairings. Article 51A defines Fundamental Duties, not Directive Principles of State Policy.  Articles 36-51 enumerate the Directive Principles of State Policy, not Fundamental Rights. Part III of the Constitution contains Fundamental Rights, not Directive Principles.  Therefore, only the pairing of Article 14 with the Right to Equality and Part IV-A with Fundamental Duties is accurate. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the structure of the Indian Constitution.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                             Characteristic
1. Fundamental Duties                         :   Justiciable in courts
2. Directive Principles of State Policy      :   Non-justiciable in courts
3. Fundamental Rights                        :   Non-justiciable in courts
4. Fundamental Duties                         :   Enforceable by writs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correctly matched. Directive Principles of State Policy are indeed non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts.  Fundamental Duties are also non-justiciable; they are aspirational guidelines, not legally enforceable rights. Fundamental Rights, conversely, *are* justiciable, meaning courts can enforce them.  The statement that Fundamental Duties can be enforced by writs is incorrect. This question assesses conceptual understanding of the differences between justiciable and non-justiciable legal provisions within the Indian Constitution.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act             Impact on Fundamental Rights
1. 42nd Amendment                          :   Removal of Right to Property as a Fundamental Right
2. 44th Amendment                          :   Addition of Fundamental Duties
3. 1st Amendment                            :   Strengthening of Fundamental Rights
4. 86th Amendment                          :   Addition of Right to Education as a Fundamental Right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 introduced significant changes, including the addition of Fundamental Duties but it did not remove Right to Property as a Fundamental Right.  The Right to Property was removed from Part III and made a legal right in Part IV-A by the 44th Amendment. The 1st Amendment Act of 1951 aimed at strengthening and clarifying certain Fundamental Rights, such as freedom of speech and expression. The 86th Amendment Act of 2002 added the Right to Education as a Fundamental Right.  Therefore, only options 1 and 3 are accurately matched. This question tests factual recall related to constitutional amendments and their impact on fundamental rights.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                       Source of Inspiration
1. Fundamental Duties                   :   French Constitution
2. Directive Principles of State Policy :   Irish Constitution
3. Fundamental Rights                   :   American Bill of Rights
4. Preamble                             :   Objectives Resolution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy in the Indian Constitution were inspired by the Irish Constitution. The Preamble's objectives were largely derived from the Objectives Resolution, presented by Jawaharlal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly.  Fundamental Rights have similarities with the American Bill of Rights, while Fundamental Duties draw inspiration from the USSR Constitution.  Thus, only the pairings of Directive Principles with the Irish Constitution and the Preamble with the Objectives Resolution are accurate. This question tests knowledge of the sources that influenced the drafting of the Indian Constitution.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                      Enforcement Mechanism
1. Fundamental Rights                  :   Article 32 (Supreme Court) and Article 226 (High Courts)
2. Directive Principles of State Policy:   Parliamentary legislation and executive action
3. Fundamental Duties                  :   Social pressure and public awareness campaigns
4. Fundamental Rights                  :   Presidential ordinances

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Rights are enforceable through Articles 32 (Supreme Court) and 226 (High Courts) which provide writs. Directive Principles are implemented through parliamentary laws and executive actions.  Fundamental Duties are not directly enforceable by courts; their implementation relies on social pressure and public awareness. Presidential ordinances are a legislative tool, not a mechanism for enforcing Fundamental Rights specifically.  Therefore, only the first two pairings are correctly matched. This question combines factual recall with an understanding of the enforcement mechanisms of different constitutional provisions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                             Description
1.  Fundamental Duties                    :  Legally enforceable rights
2.  Fundamental Rights                   :  Moral obligations of citizens
3.  Directive Principles of State Policy  :  Non-justiciable guidelines for the state
4.  Rule of Law                          :  Supremacy of the executive

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of Directive Principles of State Policy with "Non-justiciable guidelines for the state" is correct.  Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable rights but moral obligations. Fundamental Rights are legally enforceable rights. The Rule of Law emphasizes the supremacy of law, not the executive.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct.  This question assesses the understanding of fundamental legal concepts and their definitions within the Indian constitutional framework.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Case                      Landmark Judgement on
1. Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala:   Basic Structure Doctrine
2. Golaknath v. State of Punjab           :   Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights
3. Minerva Mills v. Union of India       :   Judicial review and the balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles
4.  A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras      :   Right to Privacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala established the Basic Structure Doctrine. Golaknath v. State of Punjab limited Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights. Minerva Mills v. Union of India dealt with judicial review and the balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras did not deal with the Right to Privacy, that was later established in a separate case. Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of significant Supreme Court cases and their impact on constitutional law.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                        Key Provision
1. 42nd Amendment                       :  Inclusion of "Socialist" in the Preamble
2. 86th Amendment                       :  Right to Information
3. 73rd Amendment                       :  Panchayati Raj Institutions
4. 74th Amendment                       :  Urban Local Governments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment added "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble. The 73rd Amendment deals with Panchayati Raj Institutions, and the 74th Amendment deals with Urban Local Governments. The Right to Information Act was a separate piece of legislation, not a direct outcome of a specific constitutional amendment. Therefore, options 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests factual knowledge of constitutional amendments and their key provisions.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                    Related Article
1. Right to Constitutional Remedies          :   Article 32
2. Right to Freedom of Religion             :   Article 25
3. Right to Equality                        :   Article 16
4. Right to Life and Personal Liberty       :   Article 21

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies.  Article 25 protects freedom of religion. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. Article 16 relates to equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, not general equality.  Therefore only 1,2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of the articles of the constitution related to fundamental rights.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Part of the Constitution                 Content
1. Part III                                :   Directive Principles of State Policy
2. Part IV                                 :   Fundamental Rights
3. Part IV A                               :   Fundamental Duties
4. Part I                                  :   The Union and its Territory

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Part III of the Indian Constitution deals with Fundamental Rights, and Part IV with Directive Principles of State Policy. Part IV-A contains the Fundamental Duties, and Part I deals with the Union and its territory.  Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses the understanding of the organizational structure of the Indian Constitution.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Provision Related To
1. Article 31-B                       :   Validation of certain Acts and Laws
2. Article 342-A                      :   Specification of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes
3. Article 350-B                      :   Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities
4. Article 148                       :   Comptroller and Auditor General of India
5. Article 51-A                       :   Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 31-B of the Indian Constitution deals with the validation of certain Acts and Laws enacted by the State Legislature, which are related to the Directive Principles of State Policy.  The Ninth Schedule of the Constitution contains such Acts and Laws.  Article 342-A, added by the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018, empowers the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes.  Article 350-B mandates the appointment of a Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities to investigate matters concerning their safeguards. Article 148 establishes the independent office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).  Finally, Article 51-A outlines the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens.  All the pairs provided are correctly matched to their respective constitutional provisions.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                   Role/Contribution
1. Mahatma Gandhi                         :   Influenced the drafting of Directive Principles
2. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar                       :   Advocated for Directive Principles
3. K.M. Munshi                            :   Member of the Drafting Committee
4. Jawaharlal Nehru                        :   Presented the Objectives Resolution to the Constituent Assembly
5. Granville Austin                        :   Interpretation of Directive Principles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of social and economic justice significantly influenced the inclusion and spirit of the Directive Principles of State Policy. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the chairman of the Drafting Committee, played a crucial role in their formulation and inclusion in the Constitution. K.M. Munshi was a key member of the Drafting Committee, contributing to the Constitution's overall structure. Jawaharlal Nehru, as the first Prime Minister, presented the Objectives Resolution, which laid the groundwork for many of the Constitution's guiding principles, including those reflected in the Directive Principles.  Granville Austin, a prominent scholar of Indian constitutional law, offered insightful interpretations of the Directive Principles and their implications.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit one or more of the correctly paired individuals and their contributions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                       Action Related To Directive Principles
1. State Governments                     :   Interpretation of Directive Principles
2. Central Government                   :   Enforcement of Directive Principles
3. Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) :   Implementation of Directive Principles
4. Supreme Court                        :   Review of the Constitutional Validity of Laws based on Directive Principles
5. National Education Commission       :    Formulation of Education Policies based on Directive Principles


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

State governments play a crucial role in implementing the Directive Principles at the grassroots level. The Central government is responsible for overall policy making and coordination in implementing the Directive Principles. The Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) has historically been involved in formulating and implementing plans and policies aimed at achieving the goals of the Directive Principles. The Supreme Court interprets the Constitution and rules on the constitutional validity of laws, including those enacted to give effect to Directive Principles. The National Education Commission develops education policies in line with the Directive Principles.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and hence incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept                        Characteristic/Property
1. Fundamental Rights                    :   Justiciable
2. Directive Principles                   :   Non-Justiciable
3. Fundamental Duties                     :   Non-Justiciable
4. Rule of Law                           :   Equality before the law
5. Basic Structure of the Constitution   :    Cannot be amended


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced by courts.  Directive Principles are non-justiciable, meaning they are not legally enforceable in courts.  Fundamental Duties are also non-justiciable, representing aspirational goals for citizens.  The Rule of Law, a cornerstone of a just society, encompasses the principle of equality before the law. The Basic Structure Doctrine, established through judicial pronouncements, prevents the amendment of core constitutional principles.  All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act          Significant Amendment Related To Fundamental Rights
1. 42nd Amendment Act (1976)           :   Added Fundamental Duties
2. 24th Amendment Act (1971)           :   Added Fundamental Rights
3. 44th Amendment Act (1978)           :    Modified Emergency Provisions
4. 86th Amendment Act (2002)           :    Added Right to Education
5. 97th Amendment Act (2011)          :    Added Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 24th Amendment did not add Fundamental Rights, it aimed to uphold the Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights. The 44th Amendment introduced significant modifications to the Emergency provisions. The 86th Amendment added the Right to Education as a Fundamental Right. The 97th Amendment did not add Fundamental Duties.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly paired amendments.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Body/Institution          Power/Function Related to Fundamental Rights
1. Parliament                         :   Power to amend Fundamental Rights
2. President                          :   Power to suspend Fundamental Rights during Emergency
3. Supreme Court                       :   Power to enforce Fundamental Rights
4. High Courts                         :   Power to issue writs for enforcement of Fundamental Rights
5.  Election Commission                :   Power to regulate elections under Article 324

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, through the process of constitutional amendment. The President has the power to suspend Fundamental Rights (except Articles 20 and 21) during a national emergency under Article 359. The Supreme Court is the ultimate guarantor of Fundamental Rights and has the power to enforce them through Article 32. High Courts also have the power to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights under Article 226. The Election Commission does not directly deal with the enforcement of Fundamental Rights; its function is to conduct free and fair elections as per Article 324. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because of the inclusion of the Election Commission.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                         Related Article/Provision
1. Fundamental Rights                     :   Part III of the Constitution
2. Directive Principles of State Policy     :   Part IV of the Constitution
3. Fundamental Duties                     :   Part IVA of the Constitution
4. Emergency Provisions                   :   Article 352 (National Emergency)
5. Amendment of the Constitution         :   Article 368

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Indian Constitution. Directive Principles of State Policy are detailed in Part IV. Fundamental Duties are specified in Part IVA.  Article 352 outlines the provisions for declaring a National Emergency. Article 368 lays down the procedure for amending the Constitution.  All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and hence incorrect.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Committee                                  Focus/Recommendation
1. Balwant Rai Mehta Committee               :   Panchayati Raj System
2. Ashok Mehta Committee                    :   Two-tier Panchayati Raj System
3. Swaran Singh Committee                    :   Fundamental Duties
4. Sarkaria Commission                       :   Centre-State Relations
5. National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution :   Constitutional Reforms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee's report led to the adoption of the Panchayati Raj system in India. The Ashok Mehta Committee recommended a two-tier Panchayati Raj structure. The Swaran Singh Committee played a key role in recommending the inclusion of Fundamental Duties in the Constitution. The Sarkaria Commission was tasked with reviewing Centre-State relations. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution made recommendations on various aspects of the Constitution.  All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Writ                                    Purpose/Application
1. Habeas Corpus                             :   Protection against unlawful detention
2. Mandamus                                  :   Compelling performance of a public duty
3. Certiorari                                :   Quashing an illegal order
4. Prohibition                               :   Preventing an inferior court from exceeding its jurisdiction
5. Quo Warranto                               :   Inquiry into the legality of holding an office


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Habeas corpus is a writ used to challenge unlawful detention. Mandamus compels the performance of a public duty. Certiorari quashes illegal orders or actions. Prohibition prevents an inferior court from exceeding its jurisdiction. Quo warranto is used to inquire into the legality of holding a public office.  All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                      Meaning in the context of Indian Polity
1. Vote-on-account                          :   Provision for government expenditure for a limited period
2. Interim Budget                           :   A temporary budget presented before a general election
3. Money Bill                               :   A bill dealing primarily with financial matters
4. Appropriation Bill                       :   A bill authorizing government spending
5. Consolidated Fund of India               :  The principal account of the Union Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A vote-on-account is a mechanism to provide for government expenditure for a short period, typically when a new budget is delayed. An interim budget is a temporary budget presented when the general budget cannot be passed in time. A Money Bill deals with financial matters such as taxation and expenditure. An Appropriation Bill authorizes the government to spend money. The Consolidated Fund of India is the principal account where all government revenues are credited.  All pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article              Provision/Concept
1. Article 14                          :  Equal pay for equal work
2. Article 21                          :  Right to Privacy
3. Article 352                         :  Proclamation of Emergency (National Emergency)
4. Article 368                         :  Amendment Procedure
5. Article 370 (pre-2019)             :   Special Status of Jammu and Kashmir

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 352 of the Indian Constitution deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency by the President.  Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. The Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 21 has expanded its scope to include the Right to Privacy.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

Option (a) is incorrect because, while 3 and 4 are correct,  Article 14 does not explicitly mention equal pay for equal work; that principle is derived from the broader guarantee of equality before the law and equal protection of the laws under Article 14.  Option (c) is similarly incorrect because it includes the mismatched pair 1.  Option (d) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pairs 3 and 4. The pre-2019 status of Article 370 as granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir was also a fact, but this is a matter of historical context and not a direct constitutional provision in the same sense as the others.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act       Description
1. 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act :  Added Fundamental Duties
2. 86th Constitutional Amendment Act :  Added Right to Education
3. 44th Constitutional Amendment Act :  Modified the definition of the Basic Structure
4. 1st Constitutional Amendment Act  :  Added Section 6-A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act to the 9th Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 introduced Fundamental Duties into the Constitution. The 86th Amendment Act of 2002 added the Right to Education as a Fundamental Right (Article 21A).  The 44th Amendment did not modify the definition of the basic structure; this concept evolved through judicial pronouncements, notably in the Kesavananda Bharati case. The first Amendment did not add Section 6-A.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                     Constitutional Article Primarily Related
1. Directive Principles of State Policy : Article 370
2. Fundamental Rights                : Article 19
3. Right to Constitutional Remedies   : Article 32
4. National Emergency                : Article 356


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Rights are primarily enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, with Article 19 guaranteeing several freedoms. Article 32 guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies (the right to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights).  Directive Principles of State Policy are not directly related to Article 370 (which dealt with special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir). Article 356 deals with President's Rule, not National Emergency (that's Article 352).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Judgement             Legal Principle/Concept Significantly Affected
1. Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala:  Abolition of Privy Purses
2. Minerva Mills v. Union of India     :  Basic Structure Doctrine
3. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab       :  Right to Property
4.  Indra Sawhney v. Union of India   :  Limits on Reservations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Minerva Mills case significantly impacted the Basic Structure Doctrine.  The Indra Sawhney case dealt with the limits on reservations. The Kesavananda Bharati case established the Basic Structure Doctrine, not the abolition of Privy Purses (that happened through a separate constitutional amendment).  The Golak Nath case concerned the amendment of Fundamental Rights, not the Right to Property specifically (though the right to property was later removed from the list of fundamental rights). Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article            Key Feature/Provision
1. Article 24                          :  Absolute prohibition of child labour
2. Article 25                          :  Freedom to propagate religion for non-citizens
3. Article 13                          :  Supremacy of Constitutional provisions over ordinary laws
4. Article 371                          :  Special provisions for Maharashtra and Gujarat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 13 establishes the supremacy of constitutional provisions over ordinary laws. Article 371 contains special provisions for certain states including Maharashtra and Gujarat. Article 24 prohibits the employment of children in hazardous work but does not necessarily imply an absolute prohibition; there are exceptions and reasonable limitations. Article 25 guarantees freedom of religion to citizens, not specifically to non-citizens. Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Action/Policy             Basis in Constitutional Article
1. President's Rule                     :  Article 352
2. National Emergency                  :  Article 356
3. Uniform Civil Code                   :  Article 44
4.  Abolition of Privy Purses           :  A Constitutional Amendment Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 44 mentions the Directive Principle of State Policy related to the Uniform Civil Code. The abolition of Privy Purses was achieved via a Constitutional Amendment Act. President's Rule is based on Article 356, not Article 352 (which deals with National Emergency).  The proclamation of a National Emergency is governed by Article 352. Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Right/Concept                  Availability to Non-Citizens
1. Right to Equality                   : Yes
2. Right to Life and Personal Liberty : No
3. Right to Constitutional Remedies     : Yes
4. Freedom of Religion                  : Yes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32) is available to all persons, including non-citizens, allowing them to approach the Supreme Court for redressal of their grievances.  Right to Equality (Article 14), Right to Life (Article 21), and Freedom of Religion (Article 25) are primarily available to citizens but some aspects might extend to non-citizens depending on the specific context and judicial interpretations.  Thus, only pair 3 is definitively and completely correct.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Political Figure                     Power/Function
1. President of India                   :  Appoints Governors
2. Governor of a State                 :  Dissolves State Legislative Assemblies
3. Chief Justice of India               :  Impeaches the President
4. Chief Minister of a State           :  Recommends President's Rule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints Governors of states.  The Governor of a state has the power to dissolve the state legislative assembly. The Chief Justice of India does not impeach the President; it's the Parliament that initiates impeachment proceedings. The Chief Minister does not recommend President's Rule; it's the Governor who reports to the President, forming the basis for the President's decision. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Institution/Body             Jurisdictional Power/Feature
1. Supreme Court                       :  Original jurisdiction in inter-state disputes
2. High Courts                         :  Appellate jurisdiction over subordinate courts
3. National Green Tribunal (NGT)     :  Exclusive jurisdiction over environmental matters
4. Election Commission of India       :  Resolves disputes related to party splits/mergers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States or between States. High Courts have appellate jurisdiction over subordinate courts within their respective states. The Election Commission resolves disputes related to the splits and mergers of recognized political parties. The NGT, while dealing with environmental issues, does not have exclusive jurisdiction; its decisions are appealable to the higher courts.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

     Legal Doctrine/Principle           Associated Supreme Court Case
1. Basic Structure Doctrine           :  Golaknath v. State of Punjab
2. Doctrine of Prospective Overruling:  Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala
3. Doctrine of Severability           :  Minerva Mills v. Union of India
4. Doctrine of Eclipse                :  I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case is associated with the Doctrine of Prospective Overruling, where the court may choose to apply a new ruling only to future cases. The I.R. Coelho case involved the application of the Doctrine of Eclipse, concerning the temporary suspension of a law due to conflict with fundamental rights. The Golaknath case, not Kesavananda Bharati, is associated with the Basic Structure Doctrine. The Minerva Mills case dealt with the Basic Structure Doctrine, not the Doctrine of Severability. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article Number                     Associated Right/Concept
1. Article 14                          :  Right to Education
2. Article 19                          :  Protection of life and personal liberty
3. Article 21                          :  Right to Equality before law
4. Article 31C                         :  Saving of laws giving effect to Directive Principles
5. Article 39 (b) and (c)             :  Equal pay for equal work

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because Article 31C deals with the saving of laws that implement Directive Principles, specifically those in Article 39(b) and (c), relating to equal pay and equitable distribution of resources.  Article 39 (b) and (c) are indeed concerned with equal pay for equal work and equitable distribution of resources, a core component of the Directive Principles.  The other pairings are incorrect. Article 14 deals with equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, not the Right to Education (which is related to Article 21A). Article 19 concerns various freedoms, not the protection of life and personal liberty (which is primarily Article 21). Article 21 is about protection of life and personal liberty, not equality before the law (Article 14). The inclusion of the Right to Education within Article 21 is a judicial interpretation and expansion, not an original constitutional definition. Therefore, only the pairing of Article 31C with its function and Article 39 (b) and (c) with their content are accurate.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act      Associated Change
1. 25th Amendment Act              :  Added Article 31C
2. 42nd Amendment Act              :  Added the term "secular" to the Preamble
3. 61st Amendment Act              :  Reduced voting age to 18
4. 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts   :  Established a three-tier government
5. 86th Amendment Act              :   Added a Fundamental Duty related to education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The 25th Amendment added Article 31C. The 42nd Amendment added "secular" to the Preamble.  The 61st Amendment lowered the voting age. The 73rd and 74th Amendments established the three-tier system of Panchayati Raj and urban local bodies.  However, the 86th Amendment added a Fundamental Duty related to protecting and improving the natural environment, not specifically education. While education is a recurring theme in Directive Principles which the Fundamental Duties aim to support,  the 86th amendment did not directly add a duty specific to education. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Emergency                  Constitutional Article
1. National Emergency                :  Article 360
2. State Emergency (President's Rule) :  Article 356
3. Financial Emergency              :  Article 352

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Article 356 deals with the proclamation of President's rule in a state due to a failure of constitutional machinery. Article 352 relates to National Emergency (war, external aggression, or armed rebellion), and Article 360 deals with Financial Emergency.  The other options incorrectly associate the articles with the wrong type of emergency. Therefore, only option (b) is correct.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Case               Landmark Ruling/Concept
1. Kesavananda Bharati Case        :  Abolition of the right to property
2. Minerva Mills Case               :  Balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles
3. Golaknath Case                   :  Parliament's unlimited power to amend Fundamental Rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. The *Minerva Mills* case established the crucial balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.  The *Kesavananda Bharati* case established the doctrine of basic structure, limiting Parliament's amending power, not abolishing the right to property (that happened later through a separate amendment).  The *Golak Nath* case initially held that Parliament could not amend Fundamental Rights, a position later overturned by subsequent judgments. Therefore, only the *Minerva Mills* case pairing is accurate.


**5. With reference to the Directive Principles of State Policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Article Number                      Associated Principle/Goal
1. Article 41                          :  Equal pay for equal work
2. Article 43                          :  Living wage and decent standard of living
3. Article 44                          :  Organization of village panchayats
4. Article 39                          :  Right to work, education, and public assistance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Article 43 of the Directive Principles aims to secure a living wage and a decent standard of life for workers.  The other pairings are incorrect. Article 41 deals with the right to work, education, and public assistance. Article 44 advocates for a uniform civil code. Article 39 is a broader article encompassing several principles related to social and economic justice, not exclusively linked to any one specific right or goal mentioned in the other options.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body              Primary Function
1. Election Commission             :  Auditing government accounts
2. Comptroller and Auditor-General :  Conducting recruitment examinations for All-India Services
3. Union Public Service Commission :  Ensuring free and fair elections

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Union Public Service Commission's primary function is conducting recruitment examinations for All-India Services and advising on disciplinary matters. The Election Commission ensures free and fair elections. The Comptroller and Auditor-General audits government accounts.  The other options incorrectly assign functions to the constitutional bodies. Therefore, only option (c) is correct.


**7.  With reference to Fundamental Duties, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment Act          Specific Duty Added or Amended
1. 42nd Amendment Act                   :  Protection of the environment
2. 86th Amendment Act                   :  Respect for the national flag
3.  Neither 42nd nor 86th Amendment Act :  Promoting scientific temper

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The duty to promote scientific temper, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry and reform was already part of the original list of Fundamental Duties introduced by the 42nd Amendment. The 42nd Amendment added the duty of protecting and improving the natural environment. The 86th Amendment didn't add any new fundamental duty; it only made a minor change in an already existing duty. Thus, only option (b) is accurate.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept                     Characteristic Feature
1. Fundamental Rights                 :  Non-justiciable
2. Directive Principles of State Policy :  Justiciable
3. Fundamental Duties                  :  Non-justiciable

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Fundamental Rights are justiciable (enforceable in courts), while Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties are non-justiciable (not directly enforceable in courts).  They carry moral and political weight, influencing government policy but not subject to judicial enforcement in the same way as Fundamental Rights.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act           Provision Amended/Added
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976              :   Added "Socialist", "Secular", and "Integrity" to the Preamble
2. 44th Amendment Act, 1978              :   Removed the right to property as a Fundamental Right
3. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992              :   Added Part IX to the Constitution dealing with Panchayats
4. 74th Amendment Act, 1992              :   Added Part IX-A to the Constitution dealing with Municipalities
5. 97th Amendment Act, 2011              :   Added the right to education as a Fundamental Right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs listed are correctly matched.  The 42nd Amendment significantly altered the Preamble by incorporating the terms "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity," reflecting a shift in the nation's ideological stance. The 44th Amendment removed the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights, shifting it to a legal right under Article 300A. The 73rd and 74th Amendments were landmark additions, introducing Part IX (Panchayats) and Part IX-A (Municipalities) respectively, which significantly decentralized governance.  Finally, the 97th Amendment enshrined the right to education as a Fundamental Right, recognizing its importance for social and economic development.  Therefore, all five pairs accurately represent the amendments and their corresponding constitutional changes.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution      Subject Matter
1. Article 356                               :   Procedure for the removal of the President
2. Article 352                               :   Provisions relating to the Election Commission
3. Article 368                               :   Amendment procedure of the Constitution
4. Article 324                               :   National Emergency
5. Article 21                                 :   Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Article 368 of the Indian Constitution exclusively deals with the procedure for amending the Constitution.  The other pairs are incorrect. Article 356 pertains to the President's power to impose President's Rule in a state, not the removal of the President (that process is detailed in Articles 61 and 61A). Article 352 concerns the declaration of a National Emergency. Article 324 deals with the superintendence, direction, and control of elections by the Election Commission.  Finally, Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, not the right to freedom of speech and expression (that falls under Article 19).  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one mismatched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                       Power/Function
1. Election Commission of India             :   Appointment of Governors
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)   :   Conducting Civil Services Examinations
3. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)    :   Auditing the accounts of the Union and States
4. Finance Commission                       :   Recommending principles governing the distribution of financial resources
5. National Human Rights Commission        :   Enforcing Fundamental Rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The UPSC conducts the Civil Services Examination and other recruitment examinations for the Union and State governments. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State governments, ensuring financial accountability. The Finance Commission is responsible for recommending principles for the equitable distribution of tax revenues between the Union and the States. Pair 1 is incorrect; the President appoints Governors, not the Election Commission. Pair 5 is also incorrect; the Supreme Court, primarily, enforces Fundamental Rights, although the NHRC investigates human rights violations. Option (a) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1. Option (b) is incorrect because it excludes the correctly matched pair 4. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 5.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Judgement                    Legal Principle/Doctrine Affirmed/Established
1. Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala  :   Doctrine of Essential Features of the Constitution
2. Minerva Mills v. Union of India          :   Balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles
3. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab             :    Parliament's unlimited power to amend the Constitution
4. I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu        :   Doctrine of Severability
5. Shankari Prasad v. Union of India       :   Parliament’s power to amend Fundamental Rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case established the "basic structure" doctrine, which limits Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  The Minerva Mills case clarified the balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, preventing the complete subordination of one to the other.  I.R. Coelho dealt with the Doctrine of Severability, allowing courts to uphold parts of a law even if other parts are deemed unconstitutional.  The Golak Nath case, however, argued against Parliament's unlimited power to amend the Constitution; it was later overturned. The Shankari Prasad case initially upheld Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights; this was also later overturned. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pair 3 or 5.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution       Type of Amendment Required
1.  Article 368                               :   Simple Majority
2.  Article 370 (as it stood before 2019)  :   Special Majority
3.  Article 21                                 :   No Amendment Required
4.  Article 14                                 :   Special Majority
5. Articles 330 and 332                     :   Simple Majority

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Articles relating to the amendment procedure itself (Article 368) require a special majority.  While Article 370, before its revocation, had a unique amendment process, it still required a special majority. Article 21, being a Fundamental Right, is not subject to amendment in the same way articles in the constitution are.  Articles 330 and 332, dealing with reservation of seats, are amendable but don't necessarily require a special majority.  Therefore, options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair. Option (a) is incorrect because Article 368 needs a special majority. Option (b) is incorrect because the amendment process for Article 370 was unique but also required a special majority. Option (c) is also incorrect because Article 21, while not amendable in the same way as other articles, still is a part of the constitution and is subject to the processes of Article 368.  Only option (d) accurately reflects the amendment requirements for the given articles.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act             Provision
1. 42nd Amendment Act                     :   Added "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity" to the Preamble
2. 44th Amendment Act                     :   Abolished the right to property as a Fundamental Right
3. 73rd Amendment Act                     :   Established Panchayati Raj institutions
4. 74th Amendment Act                     :   Established Municipalities
5. 97th Amendment Act                     :   Provided for co-operative societies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 is famously known for adding the words "Socialist," "Secular," and "Integrity" to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution.  The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights, though it was later reinstated as a legal right under Article 300A. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 introduced Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats, and the 74th Amendment Act of 1992 introduced Part IX-A, concerning Municipalities.  The 97th Amendment Act of 2011 added a new Part IX-B to the Constitution, dealing with co-operative societies. Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution        Right/Provision
1. Article 14                             :   Right to Equality
2. Article 19                             :   Right to Freedom
3. Article 21                             :   Right to Life and Personal Liberty
4. Article 22                             :   Protection against arrest and detention
5. Article 32                             :   Right to Constitutional Remedies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Article 19 deals with six freedoms: freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession.  Article 21 protects the right to life and personal liberty, a cornerstone of Indian constitutional law. Article 22 provides safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. Article 32 empowers the Supreme Court to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.  All the pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                      Function
1. Election Commission of India            :   Conducts elections to Parliament and State Legislatures
2. Union Ministry of Home Affairs         :   Decides election schedules
3. President of India                       :   Appoints the Chief Election Commissioner
4. Supreme Court of India                 :   Resolves disputes regarding election petitions
5. High Courts                             :   Hear election disputes at the state level


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is the independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections. The President of India appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners. The Supreme Court and High Courts have jurisdiction to hear election disputes.  While the Ministry of Home Affairs facilitates the electoral process, it does not *decide* the election schedule; that is the prerogative of the ECI. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because the Union Ministry of Home Affairs does not decide the election schedule. Option (a) and (b) are incomplete.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of Indian Federalism            Description
1. Dual Polity                              :   Division of powers between the Union and States
2. Written Constitution                    :   A codified document outlining the structure of government
3. Independent Judiciary                  :   Ensures checks and balances between the branches of government
4. Supremacy of the Constitution          :   The Constitution is the supreme law of the land
5. Bicameral Legislature                   :   A two-house Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Indian federalism is characterized by a dual polity, dividing powers between the Union and States. It has a written constitution, an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law, and the constitution is supreme. The Indian Parliament is bicameral. All the pairs accurately reflect features of Indian federalism. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not encompass all the correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Instrument of Governance             Characteristic
1.  President's Rule                      :   Article 356 of the Constitution
2.  Financial Emergency                  :   Article 360 of the Constitution
3.  National Emergency                   :   Article 352 of the Constitution
4.  Proclamation of Emergency             :   Requires parliamentary approval
5.  Governor's Rule                       :  Suspension of the State Legislative Assembly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

President's Rule (Article 356), Financial Emergency (Article 360), and National Emergency (Article 352) are all provisions within the Indian Constitution outlining specific situations where the central government can assume greater control over state affairs or the nation as a whole.  A proclamation of emergency requires parliamentary approval. While Governor's Rule often involves suspending the State Legislative Assembly, this is not always the case and it is not explicitly stated in the Constitution as a direct consequence. Therefore, only the first four pairs are correctly matched.  Option (d) is incorrect because the fifth pair does not represent an absolute and always-present consequence.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act             Provision Related to Fundamental Rights
1. 24th Amendment Act, 1971              :  Abolition of untouchability
2. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976              :  Addition of the word "secular" to the Preamble
3. 44th Amendment Act, 1978              :  Redefinition of the right to property
4. 86th Amendment Act, 2002              :  Right to Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 24th Amendment Act, 1971, aimed to remove any ambiguity surrounding the government's ability to legislate on matters relating to the abolition of untouchability, a crucial aspect of fundamental rights. The 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, added the word "secular" to the Preamble, explicitly affirming India's commitment to secularism, an important principle underpinning the protection of fundamental rights.  The 44th Amendment Act, 1978, removed the right to property from the list of fundamental rights, redefining it as a legal right.  The 86th Amendment Act, 2002, made the right to education a fundamental right under Article 21A.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair. Option (d) accurately reflects the connection between each amendment and its impact on fundamental rights.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution                Related Fundamental Right
1. Article 14                               : Right to Freedom of Religion
2. Article 15                               : Right against Exploitation
3. Article 19                               : Right to Equality
4. Article 21                               : Right to Life and Personal Liberty
5. Article 23                               : Right to Constitutional Remedies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, not freedom of religion. Article 15 prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. Article 19 deals with the six freedoms guaranteed under the right to freedom, which include freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour, falling under the right against exploitation. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly link articles to unrelated fundamental rights.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Supreme Court Case                      Landmark Judgement on Fundamental Rights
1. Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala :  Basic Structure Doctrine
2. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab           :  Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights
3. Minerva Mills v. Union of India         :  Balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles
4. I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu      :  Judicial review of Constitutional amendments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala established the "basic structure doctrine," limiting Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab held that Parliament could not amend Fundamental Rights. Minerva Mills v. Union of India highlighted the crucial balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu clarified the scope of judicial review of constitutional amendments. All four pairs accurately link the Supreme Court cases to their significant judgements concerning fundamental rights.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article                    Provision Related to Emergency Provisions
1. Article 352                               :  Financial Emergency
2. Article 356                               :  National Emergency
3. Article 360                               :  President's Rule
4. Article 358                               :  Suspension of Fundamental Rights (except Articles 20 & 21)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency, not a financial emergency. Article 356 pertains to President's Rule, which is imposed when the constitutional machinery in a state fails.  Article 360 deals with the proclamation of a Financial Emergency. Article 358 deals with the suspension of certain Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency, excluding Articles 20 and 21. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the articles' relationship to emergency provisions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act             Specific Impact on Reservation Policies
1. 77th Amendment Act, 1995              :  Reservation in promotions for SCs and STs
2. 81st Amendment Act, 2000              :  Removal of the 50% ceiling on total reservations
3. 85th Amendment Act, 2001              :  Consequential seniority in case of reservation in promotions
4. 102nd Amendment Act, 2018             :  Reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 77th Amendment Act, 1995, addressed the issue of reservation in promotions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The 81st Amendment Act, 2000, removed the 50% ceiling on reservations in backlog vacancies. The 85th Amendment Act, 2001, provided for "consequential seniority" for SCs and STs in promotion cases.  The 102nd Amendment Act, 2018, introduced a 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), not directly related to the other amendments listed.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because the 102nd Amendment introduced a separate reservation category.  Options (a) and (c) are incomplete.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article             Protection Provided
1. Article 20                        : Protection against self-incrimination
2. Article 21                        : Right to life and personal liberty
3. Article 22                        : Protection against double jeopardy
4. Article 32                        : Right to Constitutional Remedies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 20 provides protection against ex-post-facto laws, double jeopardy, and self-incrimination. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. Article 22 deals with protection against arrest and detention.  Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Options (c) and (d) incorrectly link articles to unrelated protections, and (a) is incomplete.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Emergency                 Relevant Constitutional Article
1. National Emergency               : Article 360
2. State Emergency (President's Rule) : Article 356
3. Financial Emergency              : Article 352


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 352 deals with National Emergency, not Financial Emergency.  Article 356 deals with State Emergency (President's Rule). Article 360 deals with Financial Emergency, not National Emergency. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Other options incorrectly link the types of emergencies with the constitutional articles.


**8.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body              Primary Function
1. Election Commission              :  Auditing government accounts
2. Comptroller and Auditor General :  Conducting recruitment examinations for All-India Services
3. Union Public Service Commission :  Conducting free and fair elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission conducts free and fair elections. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits government accounts. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts recruitment examinations for All-India Services.  None of the pairs in the question are correctly matched.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Schedule of the Constitution        Subject Matter
1. Third Schedule                       :  Oaths and affirmations
2. Fourth Schedule                      :  Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha
3. Fifth Schedule                       :  Administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes
4. Ninth Schedule                       :  Validation of certain land reforms Acts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Third Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with forms of oaths and affirmations.  The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha). The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes. The Ninth Schedule contains laws that are immune to judicial review, including many land reforms acts. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect because it excludes the correctly matched pair 3. Option (c) is also incorrect, as it only includes two correctly matched pairs, and option (a) is incomplete.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Part of the Constitution           Key Feature
1. Part III                               : Directive Principles of State Policy
2. Part IV                               : Fundamental Rights
3. Part IV A                              : Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Part III of the Indian Constitution deals with Fundamental Rights. Part IV deals with the Directive Principles of State Policy. Part IV-A deals with Fundamental Duties.  None of the pairs are correctly matched in the given question.  Therefore, the correct option is (d).

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Subject Matter
1. Article 32                            : Right to Constitutional Remedies
2. Article 35                           :  Enforcement of Fundamental Rights
3. Article 39A                           : Free Legal Aid
4. Article 25                           : Freedom of Religion
5. Article 31B                          : Validation of laws relating to land acquisition

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 32 guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies, allowing citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights.  Article 35 empowers Parliament to make laws defining the extent of the fundamental rights and for their implementation. Article 39A deals with the provision of free legal aid.  Article 25 guarantees freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate any religion. Article 31B validates certain laws relating to land acquisition that might otherwise be challenged on the grounds of violating fundamental rights.  All the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding the specific subject matter covered by each article is crucial for accurate matching. This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of constitutional provisions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act       Provision Amended/Added
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976          : Inclusion of Fundamental Duties
2. 61st Amendment Act, 1988          : Reduction of voting age to 18
3. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992          : Establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions
4. 44th Amendment Act, 1978          : Removal of Right to Property as a Fundamental Right
5. 86th Amendment Act, 2002          : Addition of a Fundamental Duty related to education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 is indeed famous for adding Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 61st Amendment Act of 1988 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights. Option 3 is incorrect as the 73rd Amendment Act dealt with Panchayati Raj Institutions but didn't amend or add existing provisions, but rather created new ones. Similarly, option 5 is incorrect; while the 86th Amendment did add a fundamental duty, it wasn't specifically related to education.  This question tests factual recall of key constitutional amendments and their impact. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors enhances the difficulty level.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                  Description
1.  Directive Principles of State Policy    :  Legally enforceable rights
2.  Fundamental Rights                     :  Non-justiciable in nature
3.  Fundamental Duties                     :  Part IV of the Constitution
4.  Preamble                               :  Introduces the Constitution
5.  Double Jeopardy                         :  Applies to departmental authorities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Preamble serves as an introduction to the Constitution, outlining its basic philosophy and objectives.  The other pairs are incorrect. Directive Principles of State Policy are not legally enforceable (non-justiciable), while Fundamental Rights are justiciable. Fundamental Duties are enshrined in Part IV-A, not Part IV. Double jeopardy protection does not extend to departmental or administrative authorities.  This question tests the ability to differentiate between crucial constitutional concepts and their attributes.  The inclusion of multiple incorrect pairs, each plausible yet subtly wrong, makes this question challenging.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                        Related Constitutional Article
1.  Free Legal Aid                        : Article 32
2.  Right to Equality                     : Article 14
3.  Right to Freedom of Religion          : Article 25
4.  Protection against Self-Incrimination : Article 20
5.  Right to Education                    : Article 45

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Articles 14, 25, and 20 correctly correspond to the rights mentioned. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Article 25 guarantees freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice and propagate any religion. Article 20 protects against self-incrimination. However, Article 32 is incorrect; it deals with the Right to Constitutional Remedies, not free legal aid (though Article 39A deals with free legal aid).  Article 45 is also incorrect; it is a Directive Principle of State Policy relating to free and compulsory education for children up to the age of 14. This question tests detailed knowledge of specific articles related to fundamental rights, requiring precise factual recall. The distractors are carefully chosen to be closely related to the correct answers.



**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                    Function
1.  Election Commission                  :  Auditing government accounts
2.  Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) :  Conducting elections
3.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :  Recruitment to All-India Services
4.  Finance Commission                   :  Recommending tax distribution between Union and States
5.  NITI Aayog                           :  Formulating five-year plans

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UPSC conducts examinations for recruitment to All-India Services, and the Finance Commission recommends the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and the States. These are accurate descriptions of their functions.  Pairs 1, 2, and 5 are incorrect. The Election Commission conducts elections, not the CAG. The CAG audits government accounts, not the Election Commission. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, which was responsible for formulating five-year plans; NITI Aayog's role is more policy-oriented. This question tests knowledge of the functions of key constitutional bodies and requires careful analysis to identify the correctly matched pairs amidst plausible distractors.



**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Emergency                 Constitutional Provision
1. National Emergency                 : Article 356
2. State Emergency (President's Rule) : Article 352
3. Financial Emergency               : Article 360

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Article 360 deals with the proclamation of a financial emergency.  Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect. Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a national emergency, and Article 356 deals with the imposition of President's Rule in a state (state emergency).  This question tests the knowledge of different types of emergencies and the relevant constitutional articles, demanding precise factual recall. The incorrect pairings are designed to be plausible distractors, increasing the difficulty of the question.  The question demands a high degree of accuracy in understanding constitutional provisions related to emergencies.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                                    Special Status
1. Sikkim                                  :  Initially an associate state
2. Jammu and Kashmir                     :  Special provision under Article 370 (now repealed)
3. Nagaland                                :  Protected under Article 371A
4.  Mizoram                                 :  Protected under Article 371G
5.  Arunachal Pradesh                       :  Protected under Article 371H

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Sikkim was initially an associate state before achieving full statehood. Jammu and Kashmir had special provisions under Article 370, which has since been repealed. Nagaland, Mizoram, and Arunachal Pradesh have specific provisions under Articles 371A, 371G, and 371H respectively, granting them certain special safeguards and protections. This question requires knowledge of the special status granted to various states in India and the specific constitutional articles that govern these statuses.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes this a challenging question for those lacking complete knowledge.


**8. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                        Key Feature
1. First Amendment Act, 1951           :  Added Fundamental Duties
2. Twenty-fourth Amendment Act, 1971    :  Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights
3. Forty-second Amendment Act, 1976      :  Added the word 'secular' to the Preamble
4. Forty-fourth Amendment Act, 1978    :  Abolished the right to property as a fundamental right
5.  Sixth Amendment Act, 1956          :  Reorganization of States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Twenty-fourth, Forty-second, and Forty-fourth Amendment Acts are correctly matched with their key features. The Twenty-fourth Amendment Act affirmed Parliament's power to amend Fundamental Rights. The Forty-second Amendment added 'secular' to the Preamble. The Forty-fourth Amendment abolished the right to property as a fundamental right. The Sixth Amendment Act dealt with the reorganization of states.  The First Amendment Act, however, did *not* add Fundamental Duties; that was done by the 42nd Amendment.  This question tests detailed knowledge of various constitutional amendments and their impact, demanding precise recall of amendment details.  The inclusion of a nearly correct but ultimately wrong pair (1) increases difficulty.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the 42nd Amendment and related constitutional provisions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment    Impact on Governmental Body
1. 42nd Amendment             :  Strengthened the powers of the President
2. 42nd Amendment             :  Reduced the jurisdiction of the Election Commission
3. 44th Amendment             :  Restored some powers curtailed by the 42nd Amendment
4. 73rd Amendment             :  Granted extensive powers to the Union Public Service Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment significantly enhanced the powers of Parliament, not the President.  The Election Commission's powers were not directly affected by the 42nd Amendment. The 44th Amendment partially reversed some of the changes introduced by the 42nd Amendment, aiming to restore a balance of power.  The 73rd Amendment empowered Panchayati Raj institutions, not the UPSC. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects a correctly matched pair.  The other options present misleading combinations of amendments and their impacts on various governmental bodies. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to differentiate between the effects of various constitutional amendments on different parts of the government.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept              Characteristic
1. Fundamental Duties          :  Justiciable in courts
2. Directive Principles          :  Non-justiciable in courts
3. Judicial Review               :  Curtailed by the 42nd Amendment
4. Writ Jurisdiction             :  Enhanced by the 42nd Amendment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Duties are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts. Directive Principles are also non-justiciable. The 42nd Amendment limited, not enhanced, judicial review and writ jurisdiction. Thus, only the pair relating to Directive Principles being non-justiciable is correctly matched. The other options include incorrect assertions regarding the justiciability of Fundamental Duties and the impact of the 42nd Amendment on judicial processes. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of key legal concepts within the Indian constitutional framework.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between justiciable and non-justiciable provisions.


**3.  With reference to the 42nd Amendment, consider the following pairs:**

   Action Taken                 Actor Involved
1. Amendment of the Constitution:  Janata Government
2. Repeal of parts of the 42nd Amendment:  Parliament
3.  Subject of Opinion           :   Supreme Court Judges
4. Passed in the year             :   1976


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment was enacted during the Emergency under Indira Gandhi's Congress government, not the Janata government. The Janata government later repealed certain provisions of the 42nd Amendment.  Parliament, not the Supreme Court, enacted the 42nd Amendment.  While jurists, parliamentarians, and other bodies offered opinions on the 42nd Amendment, the Supreme Court's role was primarily judicial review (which was itself limited by the amendment).  The 42nd Amendment was passed in 1976. Therefore, only the year is correctly matched. This question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze the historical context surrounding the 42nd Amendment.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the political context of the amendment's passage and subsequent modifications.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision     Associated Concept
1. Article 51A                 :  Directive Principles of State Policy
2. Article 368                 :  Amending Power of Parliament
3. Part IV of the Constitution   :  Fundamental Rights
4. Article 14                  :  Equality before the law


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 51A defines Fundamental Duties, not Directive Principles. Article 368 outlines the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. Part IV of the Constitution deals with Directive Principles of State Policy, not Fundamental Rights. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws.  Therefore, only the pairs concerning Article 368 and Article 14 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific constitutional articles and their corresponding concepts. It demands accurate factual recall and understanding of the Indian Constitution's structure. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related constitutional provisions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Amendment          Specific Impact
1. 42nd Amendment       :   Introduced the concept of a Uniform Civil Code
2. 52nd Amendment       :   Added anti-defection provisions
3. 44th Amendment       :   Completely repealed the 42nd Amendment
4. 73rd Amendment       :   Conferred powers on Municipalities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment did not introduce the Uniform Civil Code; it's mentioned in the Directive Principles. The 52nd Amendment introduced anti-defection laws. The 44th Amendment did not completely repeal the 42nd Amendment; it only modified certain provisions. The 73rd Amendment conferred powers on Panchayats, not Municipalities (that was the 74th). Therefore, only the pair related to the 52nd Amendment is correctly matched. This question tests factual knowledge of specific constitutional amendments and their impacts.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test understanding of the nuances of these amendments and their effects.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Indian Parliament and its functions, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Official        Action/Power Related to Parliament
1.  President of India              :  Dissolves the Lok Sabha
2.  Governor of a State            :  Recommends the dissolution of a State Legislative Assembly
3.  Rajya Sabha                     :  Initiates a money bill
4.  Speaker of Lok Sabha           :  Certifies a bill as a Money Bill

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India, as per Article 85 of the Constitution, possesses the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha (House of the People) on the advice of the Prime Minister.  The Governor of a State, under Article 174, can recommend the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly to the President. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the crucial role of certifying a bill as a Money Bill, a power explicitly granted under Article 110.  However,  Rajya Sabha cannot initiate a money bill; only the Lok Sabha can.  Money bills must originate in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  Therefore, option (b) correctly identifies the matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, either due to mismatched powers or incorrect attribution of power. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the false pairing of Rajya Sabha with initiating a money bill.


**2. With reference to the legislative process in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                       Power of the Rajya Sabha
1.  Money Bill                       :  Can reject the bill
2.  Ordinary Bill                    :  Can amend the bill
3.  Constitutional Amendment Bill :  Can amend the bill

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) plays a significant role in the legislative process, but its powers differ depending on the type of bill. For ordinary bills and constitutional amendment bills, the Rajya Sabha has the power to amend the bill. However, its power is limited in the case of money bills. A money bill cannot be rejected by the Rajya Sabha; it can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha cannot reject a money bill. Option (c) omits the correct matching of ordinary bills and constitutional amendment bills. Option (d) is incorrect as it wrongly includes the Rajya Sabha's power to reject a money bill.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Subject Matter
1. Article 3                         :  Formation of new states
2. Article 352                       :  Financial Emergency
3. Article 360                       :  National Emergency
4. Article 356                       :  President's Rule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Indian Constitution deals with the formation of new states and alteration of areas, boundaries, or names of existing states. Article 356 pertains to the imposition of President's Rule in a state when the constitutional machinery breaks down.  However, Articles 352 and 360 are incorrectly paired with their respective subjects. Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency, while Article 360 deals with the proclamation of a Financial Emergency. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatching of Articles 352 and 360 with their corresponding subjects.


**4. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                  Function
1.  Estimates Committee        :   Examines the budget estimates
2.  Public Accounts Committee  :   Audits the government accounts
3.  Committee on Public Undertakings :  Scrutinizes the working of Public Sector Undertakings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Estimates Committee of the Parliament meticulously scrutinizes the budget estimates presented by the government, ensuring efficient allocation of funds. The Public Accounts Committee examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India to ensure financial accountability. The Committee on Public Undertakings investigates the performance and efficiency of public sector undertakings. All three committees play crucial roles in parliamentary oversight of government expenditure and performance.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                     Procedure in Parliament
1.  Money Bill                      : Requires the Rajya Sabha's approval before transmission to the President
2.  Ordinary Bill                    :  Can be introduced in either House
3.  Constitutional Amendment Bill :  Requires a special majority in both Houses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Ordinary bills can indeed be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, and constitutional amendment bills necessitate a special majority in both houses for passage.  However, the statement about money bills is incorrect.  Money bills originate in the Lok Sabha, and while the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations, it cannot reject a money bill. The Lok Sabha's decision on the money bill is final, and it is only after Lok Sabha's approval that it goes to the President for assent. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude pairings.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Provision Related To
1. Article 352                      :  Proclamation of Financial Emergency
2. Article 356                      :  President's Rule in a State
3. Article 360                      :  Proclamation of National Emergency
4. Article 368(2)                  :  Amendment of the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Article 356 deals with the President's Rule, which is the imposition of central rule in a state when its constitutional machinery breaks down.  Article 352 pertains to the proclamation of a National Emergency, not a Financial Emergency.  Article 360 deals with the proclamation of a Financial Emergency. Article 368(2) outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. The other pairs incorrectly link articles with the wrong provisions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Year of Emergency Declaration     Specific Event/Context
1. 1962                              :  Indo-China War
2. 1971                              :  Indo-Pak War
3. 1975                              :  Internal Political Instability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A state of National Emergency was declared in 1962 in response to the Sino-Indian War and in 1975 due to internal political instability.  While there was a war with Pakistan in 1971, the National Emergency was not declared *during* that war (though it was later declared for other reasons).  The other pairings incorrectly associate years with unrelated events.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                  Associated Constitutional Article
1. Fundamental Rights              :  Article 352
2. Right to Education               :  Article 21A
3. Right to Manage Religious Affairs:  Article 30
4. Minorities' Right to Education  :  Article 26


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Article 21A guarantees the Right to Education.  Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, not Article 352 (which deals with National Emergencies). Article 26 deals with the freedom of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs, while Article 30 guarantees the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.  The other pairings incorrectly link legal concepts with the wrong constitutional articles.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governmental Body/Official       Power/Function During National Emergency
1. President                       :  Suspends all Fundamental Rights
2. Parliament                     :  Makes laws on state subjects
3. Cabinet                         :  Advises the President on proclamation of Emergency
4. Lok Sabha                       :  Extension of its term


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. During a National Emergency, Parliament can make laws on state subjects. The Cabinet advises the President on the proclamation of an emergency. The Lok Sabha's term can be extended.  The President doesn't suspend *all* Fundamental Rights; Articles 20 and 21 remain in effect. The other pairings incorrectly ascribe powers to the wrong governmental bodies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Emergency              Key Constitutional Provision
1. National Emergency              :  Article 365
2. State Emergency (President's Rule):  Article 356
3. Financial Emergency             :  Article 360


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Articles 356 and 360 correctly correspond to State Emergency (President's Rule) and Financial Emergency, respectively. Article 365 deals with the failure of a state to comply with the directions of the Union, not the declaration of a National Emergency itself. Article 352 is the correct provision for the declaration of a National Emergency.  The other pairings incorrectly associate types of emergencies with the wrong constitutional articles.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act   Specific impact on Emergency Provisions
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976       :  Reduced the scope of Emergency powers
2. 44th Amendment Act, 1978       :  Expanded the scope of Emergency powers
3. 38th Amendment Act, 1975       :  Made the declaration of Emergency immune to judicial review


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the declaration of Emergency immune to judicial review.  The 42nd Amendment Act expanded, not reduced, the scope of emergency powers. The 44th Amendment Act, conversely, curtailed the scope of emergency powers.  The other pairings incorrectly link amendment acts with their effects on emergency provisions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Political Figure               Role during the 1975-77 Emergency
1. Indira Gandhi                    :  Leader of the Janata Party
2. Jayaprakash Narayan             :  Prominent voice against the Emergency
3. Morarji Desai                    :  Prime Minister during the Emergency
4. Jagjivan Ram                     :  Leader of the Congress for Democracy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister during the Emergency, not the leader of the Janata Party. Jayaprakash Narayan was a prominent voice of opposition against the Emergency. Jagjivan Ram was a leader of the Congress for Democracy, a party formed in opposition to Indira Gandhi's policies.  Morarji Desai became Prime Minister *after* the Emergency ended. The other pairings incorrectly associate political figures with their roles during the Emergency.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party                     Post-Emergency Electoral Outcome (1977)
1. Janata Party                         :  Won a clear majority in Lok Sabha
2. Indian National Congress           :  Retained power in South India
3. Congress for Democracy              :  Merged with the Bharatiya Janata Party


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Janata Party won a clear majority in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress party retained significant power in South India, unlike in the North. The Congress for Democracy merged with the Janata Party, not the BJP.  The other pairings incorrectly describe the post-emergency electoral outcomes.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution      Provision
1. Article 29                               : Right to conserve distinct language, script, or culture
2. Article 30                               : Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions
3. Article 32                               : Right to Constitutional Remedies
4. Article 350-B                            : Provision for a Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 29 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to conserve a distinct language, script, or culture to any section of citizens residing in any part of India. Article 30 grants religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Article 32 ensures the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Finally, Article 350-B mandates the appointment of a Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities to investigate matters related to their safeguards.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer as all four pairs are accurate representations of the constitutional provisions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Minority Educational Institution     Characteristic
1. Institutions seeking recognition and aid from the State  :   Subject to state regulatory power regarding syllabus, standards, etc.
2. Institutions seeking only recognition from the State    :   Free to administer their affairs but subject to general laws
3. Institutions seeking neither recognition nor aid       :   Subject to state regulatory power regarding student welfare
4. Unaided minority educational institutions           :   Freedom to appoint teachers subject to eligibility criteria

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe the characteristics of different types of minority educational institutions as per the constitutional provisions and judicial interpretations.  Institutions seeking both recognition and aid are subject to state regulations on various aspects of their functioning, including syllabus, standards, and staff.  Those seeking only recognition are still bound by general laws but have more autonomy in their internal administration.  Institutions that neither seek recognition nor aid operate independently, except for general laws.  Finally, unaided institutions enjoy freedom in teacher appointments, subject to meeting state-defined eligibility criteria.  Therefore, option (d) is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and omit correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act          Provision Added/Amended/Deleted
1. 44th Amendment Act                    : Deleted the Right to Property as a Fundamental Right
2. 86th Amendment Act                    : Inserted the Right to Education (Article 21A)
3. 7th Amendment Act                     : Inserted Article 350-B (Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities)
4. 42nd Amendment Act                    : Added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 44th Amendment Act removed the Right to Property as a Fundamental Right, shifting it to Part IV-A as a Constitutional right.  The 86th Amendment Act introduced the Right to Education (Article 21A). The 7th Amendment Act added Article 350-B to address the issue of linguistic minorities. The 42nd Amendment Act included Fundamental Duties in the Constitution.  Option (b) correctly matches these amendments with their corresponding constitutional changes. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the amendments or omit correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Writ                                     Power to Issue
1. Habeas Corpus                          : Supreme Court only
2. Mandamus                               : High Courts and Supreme Court
3. Certiorari                              : Supreme Court and other courts empowered by Parliament
4. Quo Warranto                           : High Courts only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction to issue all five writs (habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto) for the enforcement of fundamental rights. High Courts also possess this power under Article 226.  Parliament can empower other courts to issue writs, but this does not affect the Supreme Court's power.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.  Pair 1 is incorrect because the Supreme Court is not the *only* entity that can issue a writ of habeas corpus.  Pair 4 is incorrect because the High Courts are not the *only* entity empowered to issue a writ of quo warranto. Hence, option (a) is the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                                      Characteristic
1. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)       : Appointed by the President
2. National Commission for Backward Classes     :  Submits annual reports to the President
3. Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities     :  Investigates matters relating to linguistic minority safeguards
4. Election Commission                          :  Safeguards the independence of the CAG

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CAG is appointed by the President, the National Commission for Backward Classes submits annual reports to the President, and the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities investigates matters related to linguistic minority safeguards. However, the Election Commission does not safeguard the independence of the CAG;  the Constitution and legal provisions do that. Thus, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is correct, while (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article of the Indian Constitution          Subject Matter
    1. Article 124                               :  Establishment of the Supreme Court of India
    2. Article 136                               :  Special Leave to Appeal to the Supreme Court
    3. Article 143                               :  Advisory Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
    4. Article 32                                :  Right to Constitutional Remedies
    5. Article 352                               :  Proclamation of Emergency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Article 124 of the Indian Constitution deals with the establishment and constitution of the Supreme Court of India, outlining its composition, powers, and functions. Article 136 grants the Supreme Court the power to grant special leave to appeal, allowing it to hear cases from any court or tribunal within India.  Article 143 pertains to the Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction, where the President can seek its opinion on any matter of law or fact. Article 32 is crucial as it guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, enabling citizens to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of their fundamental rights. Finally, Article 352 empowers the President to declare a national emergency under specific circumstances.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  A comprehensive understanding of the Indian Constitution's key articles is essential for a correct response.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Supreme Court Judgement                     Legal Principle Involved
    1. Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973)         :  Doctrine of Basic Structure
    2. Minerva Mills Case (1980)                :  Judicial Review's limits
    3. Golak Nath Case (1967)                   :  Parliament's amending power
    4. Shankari Prasad Case                     :  Amendment of Fundamental Rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Kesavananda Bharati case established the "basic structure doctrine," limiting Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. The Minerva Mills case further refined this doctrine by defining the limits of judicial review concerning amendments. The Golak Nath case initially held that Parliament could not amend Fundamental Rights, a position later overturned. The Shankari Prasad case, preceding Golak Nath, upheld Parliament's right to amend Fundamental Rights. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, encompassing all the significant legal principles and landmark cases related to the limits of amending power and judicial review in the Indian constitutional framework. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article                     Power/Function
    1. Article 14                               :  Equality before law
    2. Article 19                               :  Freedom of Speech and Expression
    3. Article 20                               :  Protection against double jeopardy
    4. Article 31C                              :  Limitations on Fundamental Rights
    5. Article 368                              :  Amendment Procedure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Article 19 guarantees fundamental rights related to freedoms of speech and expression, assembly, association, etc. Article 20 protects against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy. Article 31C allows the state to make laws imposing limitations on fundamental rights for implementing Directive Principles of State Policy.  Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. Option (c) accurately represents the correct matching of all the constitutional articles with their respective powers and functions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of fundamental constitutional provisions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    President of India's Action                Constitutional Basis
    1. Proclamation of National Emergency      :  Article 352
    2. Issuance of Ordinances                   :  Article 123
    3. Appointment of Governors                 :  Article 155
    4. Seeking Advisory Opinion from Supreme Court : Article 143
    5.  Dissolution of Lok Sabha                 : Article 85

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Article 352 empowers the President to proclaim a national emergency. Article 155 deals with the appointment of state governors by the President. Article 143 allows the President to seek an advisory opinion from the Supreme Court. Article 85 grants the President the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha.  However, pair 2 is incorrect. While the President can issue ordinances under Article 123, this power is not unique to the President; the Governor of a state has a similar power under Article 213.  Therefore, only options including 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. Option (c) is the correct answer as it includes only correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are either incomplete or include incorrectly matched pairs.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the President's powers and their constitutional basis.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Supreme Court Jurisdiction                 Type of Jurisdiction
    1. Disputes between the Union and States   :  Original Jurisdiction
    2. Appeals from High Courts                 :  Appellate Jurisdiction
    3.  Presidential Election Disputes          :  Original Jurisdiction
    4. Advisory Jurisdiction on Presidential Reference: Advisory Jurisdiction
    5. Cases involving Fundamental Rights      :  Writ Jurisdiction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Supreme Court exercises original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States (Article 131) and in Presidential election disputes (Article 329B). It possesses appellate jurisdiction over appeals from High Courts (Article 132, 133, 134, 134A, 136).  The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction is exercised when the President refers a matter to it for opinion (Article 143).  The Supreme Court also holds writ jurisdiction under Article 32, enabling it to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect. This question assesses a candidate's in-depth knowledge of the Supreme Court's diverse jurisdictions and their constitutional foundations.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Associated Right
1. Article 14                          : Right to Equality of Opportunity in Matters of Public Employment
2. Article 15                          : Prohibition of Discrimination on Grounds of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex, or Place of Birth
3. Article 16                          : Right to Freedom of Religion
4. Article 19(1)(a)                    : Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression
5. Article 21                          : Right to Life and Personal Liberty

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.  While it doesn't explicitly mention "equality of opportunity in public employment," this right is derived from and extensively interpreted under Article 14.  Article 15 prohibits discrimination based on the listed grounds, aligning with the pair. Article 16 specifically addresses equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, making the provided pairing incorrect. Article 19(1)(a) clearly deals with freedom of speech and expression, correctly matched. Article 21, the right to life and personal liberty, is a fundamental right and a broad provision encompassing various facets of individual liberty, making the pairing correct.  Option (d) accurately reflects the correct pairings, acknowledging the derived nature of the right under Article 14 and the broad interpretation of Article 21. Options (a), (b), and (c) present incomplete or inaccurate pairings, overlooking the interconnectedness of several articles and the scope of fundamental rights.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                     Characteristic
1.  Fundamental Right                :  Can be amended by Parliament with a simple majority
2.  Basic Structure                   :  Defined exhaustively in the Constitution
3.  Article 32                       :  Provides for enforcement of Directive Principles
4.  Right to Property                 :  Currently a Constitutional Right
5.  Article 19(1)                     :  Guarantees freedom of movement throughout India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Fundamental Rights can be amended, but the scope of amendment is limited by the "basic structure doctrine". A simple majority isn't sufficient to alter the core principles. The basic structure isn't exhaustively defined; it evolves through judicial interpretation.  Article 32 protects Fundamental Rights, not Directive Principles; Article 32 is the right to constitutional remedies. The right to property is no longer a fundamental right, it's a constitutional right. Article 19(1) encompasses several freedoms, including freedom of speech and expression, not specifically freedom of movement throughout India (that's implied under Article 19 but not the core of 19(1)). Therefore, none of the provided pairs are completely accurate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act        Impact on Fundamental Rights
1.  First Amendment Act, 1951         :  Introduced restrictions on freedom of speech and expression
2.  Fourth Amendment Act, 1955        :  Removed the right to property as a fundamental right
3.  Twenty-fourth Amendment Act, 1971 :  Curtailed the scope of judicial review of fundamental rights
4.  Forty-second Amendment Act, 1976   :  Strengthened the enforcement of fundamental rights
5.  Forty-fourth Amendment Act, 1978   :  Limited the power of the Parliament to amend fundamental rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The First Amendment Act, 1951, indeed introduced certain reasonable restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression (Article 19). The Fourth Amendment Act, 1955, did not remove the right to property as a fundamental right at that time; it was the 44th Amendment that did this. The Twenty-fourth Amendment Act, 1971, aimed to curb judicial review of certain fundamental rights, thereby impacting their enforcement. The Forty-second Amendment Act, 1976, did not strengthen the enforcement of fundamental rights; rather, it aimed to curtail them. The Forty-fourth Amendment Act, 1978, re-established the limits on the Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights, reversing some of the changes made by the 42nd Amendment.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Document                     Provision Related To
1.  Constitution of India             :  Establishment of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
2.  Government of India Act, 1935    :  Introduction of Provincial Autonomy
3.  Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878:  Regulation of inter-state water disputes
4.  Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904:  Protection of ancient monuments and archaeological sites
5.  Public Records Act, 1993          :  Management of religious affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India establishes the CAG as an independent institution to audit government accounts. The Government of India Act of 1935 introduced a system of provincial autonomy in India. The Indian Treasure and Trove Act does not regulate inter-state water disputes; that's covered by separate legislation. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, is clearly focused on protecting historical sites. The Public Records Act, 1993, deals with the management of public records, not religious affairs.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Institution        Function/Power
1.  Parliament                        :  Appoints judges to the Supreme Court
2.  President of India                 :  Can dissolve the Lok Sabha
3.  Chief Election Commissioner       :  Can declare a law unconstitutional
4.  High Courts                       :  Have original jurisdiction in election disputes
5.  CAG                               :  Has judicial powers to prosecute those violating financial laws


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Parliament plays a crucial role in the appointment of Supreme Court judges, though the President formally appoints them based on Parliament's recommendation. The President can dissolve the Lok Sabha, a key aspect of the parliamentary system.  The Chief Election Commissioner does not have the power to declare laws unconstitutional; that power resides with the judiciary. High Courts handle election disputes at the state level, but not at the national level (Parliamentary elections). The CAG audits government accounts and reports to Parliament, but doesn't have judicial powers for prosecution.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision          Subject Matter
1. Article 275(1)                    :  Grants to states for raising the level of administration in the Scheduled Areas
2. Article 243(A)                    :  Provisions relating to the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Panchayats
3. Article 21                          :  Right to education
4.  Directive Principles of State Policy:  Securing a uniform civil code
5. Article 370                         :  Special status for Jammu and Kashmir


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 275(1) deals with grants to states for administration in Scheduled Areas, primarily for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes. Article 243(A) concerns the Gram Sabha and its powers, including the reservation of seats. Article 21 encompasses the right to life and personal liberty but right to education is derived from it and not directly mentioned in Article 21. The Directive Principles of State Policy include the objective of a uniform civil code. Article 370 granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir (now repealed).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                     Correctness
1. Union Territories are represented in Rajya Sabha : True
2. Chief Election Commissioner adjudicates election disputes: False
3. Parliament consists of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha only: False

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Union Territories do not have direct representation in the Rajya Sabha. The Chief Election Commissioner does not adjudicate election disputes; that's the role of courts and tribunals. The Parliament of India also includes the President. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are false, making (b) the correct answer.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about Consumer Rights                Correctness
1. Consumers can take food samples for testing      : True
2. No fee is required for consumer complaints       : False
3. Legal heirs can file complaints on behalf of deceased consumers : True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Consumers have the right to take samples for testing under certain circumstances, as per consumer protection laws.  However, filing a complaint usually involves a nominal fee. Legal heirs can file complaints on behalf of deceased consumers. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Original Jurisdiction of Supreme Court          Correctness
1. Dispute between India and one or more states    : True
2. Dispute regarding parliamentary elections        : True
3. Dispute between India and a Union Territory     : False
4. Dispute between two or more states             : True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the Government of India and one or more states, and between two or more states. Disputes regarding elections to Parliament fall under its appellate jurisdiction. Disputes between the Government of India and a Union Territory are typically handled by other courts.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government of India Act, 1919 Feature       Correctness
1. Introduction of dyarchy                   : True
2. Separate communal electorates for Muslims  : True
3. Devolution of legislative authority          : True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced dyarchy (dual governance) in provinces, separate communal electorates for Muslims, and some devolution of legislative authority. All three statements are accurate.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

   Rajya Sabha's Special Powers          Correctness
1. Changing a state's territory or name : True
2. Passing resolutions for All-India Services: True
3. Amending presidential election procedure : False

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha has the power to pass resolutions that enable Parliament to make laws on state subjects and create All-India Services.  It can also pass resolutions to change state boundaries and names. However, the amendment to presidential election procedures is not exclusively under Rajya Sabha's purview. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Control over Public Finance Method   Correctness
1. Presenting Annual Financial Statement            : True
2. Withdrawing money from Consolidated Fund only after Appropriation Bill : True
3. Providing supplementary grants and vote-on-account : True
4. Mid-year review by a Parliamentary Budget Office : False
5. Introducing Finance Bill                          : True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Parliament's control over public finance involves presenting the Annual Financial Statement (budget), approving the Appropriation Bill for fund withdrawals, and providing supplementary grants and vote-on-account mechanisms.  A Parliamentary Budget Office for mid-year reviews isn't a constitutionally mandated or universally established mechanism. Introducing the Finance Bill is also a crucial aspect of parliamentary financial control. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision Bearing on Education     Correctness
1. Directive Principles of State Policy                : True
2. Rural and Urban Local Bodies                     : True
3. Fifth Schedule                                   : False
4. Sixth Schedule                                  : False
5. Seventh Schedule                                 : False

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy emphasize the state's responsibility for providing education. Rural and urban local bodies play a significant role in primary education. The Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Schedules don't directly address education; they deal with administrative and legislative arrangements. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

   Importance of CAG's Office                     Correctness
1. Exchequer control during emergencies           : False
2. CAG reports discussed by Public Accounts Committee: True
3. Information used for pressing charges            : True
4. Judicial powers for prosecuting violations      : False

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3 and 4 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CAG's role primarily involves auditing and reporting.  While its reports are crucial for parliamentary scrutiny (Public Accounts Committee) and can inform investigations, the CAG doesn't directly exercise exchequer control during emergencies or possess judicial powers for prosecution.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about Prime Minister's Appointment   Correctness
1. Need not be a Member of Parliament initially   : True
2. Must become a Member of Parliament within six months: True
3. Must be a Member of Lok Sabha                  : False
4. Must be a Member of either House               : False

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prime Minister need not be a Member of Parliament at the time of appointment but must become a member of either house within six months of their appointment.  The Constitution does not mandate membership of Lok Sabha specifically. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**16. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about Delimitation Commission         Correctness
1. Orders cannot be challenged in court           : False
2. Orders cannot be modified by Legislature       : False

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The orders of the Delimitation Commission can be challenged in court, and the legislature can make suggestions, though they may not significantly alter the final orders.  Both statements are incorrect.


**17. Consider the following pairs:**

   Document the President Must Lay Before Parliament  Correctness
1. Recommendations of Union Finance Commission       : True
2. Report of Public Accounts Committee              : False
3. Report of Comptroller and Auditor General         : True
4. Report of National Commission for Scheduled Castes: True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The President is constitutionally obligated to lay before Parliament the recommendations of the Finance Commission, the CAG's report, and reports of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. The Public Accounts Committee reports to Parliament, not directly to the President. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.


**18. Consider the following pairs:**

   Circumstances Requiring Joint Sitting of Parliament     Correctness
1. Deadlock during Ordinary Legislation Passage        : True
2. Deadlock during Money Bill Passage                  : False
3. Deadlock during Constitution Amendment Bill Passage : True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A joint sitting of Parliament is called to resolve deadlocks between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha during the passage of ordinary legislation and constitutional amendment bills.  Money bills are not subject to a joint sitting; the Lok Sabha's decision prevails.


**19. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fundamental Duty                                    Correctness
1. Preserving composite culture                         : True
2. Protecting weaker sections from social injustice       : True
3. Developing scientific temper and spirit of inquiry     : True
4. Striving towards excellence in all spheres           : True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements represent Fundamental Duties as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.


**20. Consider the following pairs:**

   Provision Safeguarding Supreme Court Autonomy     Correctness
1. President consults CJI during appointments        : True
2. Supreme Court judges removable by CJI only         : False
3. Judges' salaries charged on Consolidated Fund      : True
4. Appointments of officers after consulting CJI       : True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The President consults the Chief Justice of India (CJI) while appointing Supreme Court judges.  Judges' salaries are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, ensuring their independence.  Appointments of court staff are made in consultation with the CJI.  However, the CJI alone cannot remove judges; a specific impeachment process is involved. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**21. Consider the following pairs:**

   Member of National Development Council       Correctness
1. Prime Minister                               : True
2. Chairman, Finance Commission                  : False
3. Union Cabinet Ministers                         : True
4. Chief Ministers of States                      : True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Development Council (NDC) comprises the Prime Minister, Union Cabinet Ministers, and Chief Ministers of States. The Chairman of the Finance Commission is not a member.


**22. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Rajamannar Committee (1969)                    : False

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

(b) 1, 3 and 4
(c) 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Parliamentary committees, including ad hoc and department-related standing committees, review the performance of independent regulators. The Finance Commission, NITI Aayog, and the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission do not directly review these regulators in the same way.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the role and functions of the State in India's constitutional framework.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria, including detailed explanations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State Function                      Source of Authority
1.  Imposition of duties on succession to agricultural land  :  State Legislature
2.  Collection of estate duty in respect of agricultural land :  Presidential Order
3.  Provision of pensions                     :  State Budget
4.  Organization of village panchayats          :  Directive Principles of State Policy
5.  Collection of taxes on mineral rights      :  State's fiscal autonomy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The State's power to impose duties on succession to agricultural land stems from its legislative powers conferred by the Constitution, typically exercised through the State Legislature.  The provision of pensions is a State function funded through the State Budget. The State's collection of taxes on mineral rights is a direct consequence of its fiscal autonomy and inherent power to generate revenue.

Option 2 is incorrect because the collection of estate duty on agricultural land is not primarily determined by a Presidential Order. While the President holds certain powers, the primary authority for such taxation usually rests with the State Legislature.

Option 4 is partially correct as the organisation of village panchayats is related to Directive Principles of State Policy, but it's not the sole source of authority.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides the legal framework, which is enacted by Parliament but implemented by the State.  Hence, it's not a precise match.



**2. With reference to the Indian State, consider the following pairs:**

   Governmental Body                  Specific Function
1.  State Public Service Commission    :   Appointment of Ministers
2.  High Court                         :   Enforcement of Article 17
3.  Advocate General                  :   Representation of the State in court
4.  Police Force                       :   Implementation of State Disaster Management Policy
5.  Municipalities                     :   Collection of land revenue


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Advocate General represents the State in court, a core function defined by constitutional provisions and legal practice.  The other options are incorrect.  The State Public Service Commission handles appointments to civil services, not Ministers (who are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister). The High Court's jurisdiction is broader than just Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability); it extends to various legal matters within the state. The Police Force assists in disaster management, but the overall policy implementation is a broader governmental function. Municipalities handle local taxation and services, not land revenue collection, which is usually a direct State function.




**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian State's obligations:**

1. The State is obligated to secure a Uniform Civil Code.
2. The State is obligated to pay compensation for the acquisition of private property.
3. The State is obligated by the Directive Principles of State Policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The State's obligation to provide compensation for acquired private property is enshrined in the Constitution, reflecting the principle of just compensation.  The State's adherence to Directive Principles of State Policy is a constitutional mandate, though these are not justiciable in the same way as Fundamental Rights.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Constitution mentions a Uniform Civil Code as a Directive Principle, it is not a legally binding obligation.  The State may strive towards it, but its implementation is not judicially enforceable.



**4.  With reference to minority educational institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Institution                                    Characteristic
1.  Institutions receiving aid from the State           :   Complete prohibition of religious instruction
2.  Institutions administered by the State but established under an endowment or trust :   Permitted religious instruction on a voluntary basis
3.  Institutions recognised by the State                :   Complete freedom to administer affairs, subject only to general laws


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Institutions administered by the State but established under an endowment or trust typically allow religious instruction, but usually on a voluntary basis. The other options misrepresent the legal position. Institutions receiving state aid are subject to certain regulations, but not necessarily a complete prohibition of religious instruction.  Recognized institutions are subject to state regulations regarding educational standards and other aspects but do not have complete freedom from general laws.




**5. Consider the following statements about the suspension of Fundamental Rights in India:**

1.  Fundamental Rights can be suspended only by a proclamation of National Emergency.
2.  Articles 20 and 21 (Protection in respect of conviction for offences and Protection of life and personal liberty) cannot be suspended even during a National Emergency.
3.  The suspension of Fundamental Rights requires a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

While a National Emergency can lead to the suspension of certain Fundamental Rights, it's not the only way.  The process is far more complex than that.  Critically, Articles 20 and 21 are specifically protected and cannot be suspended even during a National Emergency.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Parliament is involved in the process, a simple resolution is not sufficient for suspension; the President's power is crucial.  The process involves the President's proclamation and subsequent parliamentary approval.


**6. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                    Characteristic
1.  Appointment                               :   By the President of India
2.  Removal                                  :   By a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament
3.  Tenure                                    :   Six years or until age 65, whichever is earlier
4.  Primary Responsibility                    :   Upholding laws of the State Legislatures
5.  Oath of Office                           :   To bear true faith and allegiance to the Prime Minister


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The CAG's appointment by the President, removal process involving a resolution from both Houses of Parliament, and tenure are all correctly matched with their characteristics.  Option 4 is incorrect because the CAG's primary responsibility is to uphold the Constitution and the laws of Parliament, not just State Legislatures. Option 5 is incorrect because the CAG's oath is to the Constitution of India, not to the Prime Minister.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                      Power/Function
1.  Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities:   Appointed by the Governor
2.  National Commission for Backward Classes:   Reports to the Prime Minister
3.  Election Commission                      :   Supervises elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission's role in supervising elections is a core constitutional function.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities is appointed by the President, not the Governor.  The National Commission for Backward Classes (though its exact form has changed over time) reports to the President, not the Prime Minister.


These questions test factual recall, analysis (matching pairs), and conceptual understanding of the Indian constitutional framework and the roles of various constitutional bodies. The plausible distractors in the options make these questions challenging and suitable for a UPSC-level examination.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Supreme Court of India.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding precise factual recall and analysis.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization         Action/Decision
1. Supreme Court       :   Imposed a ban on mining in Goa
2. Supreme Court       :   Upheld an order in the Ayodhya case
3. Supreme Court       :   Located in Kolkata during the British Raj
4. Supreme Court       :   Interprets the powers of the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has indeed issued orders impacting mining activities in various parts of India, including Goa.  While the specific details of the rulings may vary over time, the general premise of judicial intervention in mining matters is accurate.  Similarly, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in adjudicating the Ayodhya land dispute, ultimately upholding a specific order. The Supreme Court's location in Kolkata during the British Raj is a historically accurate fact.  Finally, the Supreme Court interprets the powers of the President, acting as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional disputes involving the executive branch.

Option (a) is incorrect because, while the Supreme Court was located in Kolkata historically, the other statements are not universally true in all instances. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the historically verifiable placement of the Supreme Court in Kolkata. Option (c) is again partially correct, but omits the accurate fact regarding the Supreme Court's role in interpreting Presidential powers.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept       Supreme Court Action
1.  Fundamental Rights   :  Amended by a ruling on the Representation of the People Act, 1951
2.  Directive Principles :  Interpreted in the Kesavananda Bharati case
3.  Contempt of Court    :  Power to punish for contempt
4.  Judicial Review      :  Exercises judicial review over parliamentary laws


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has, through its judgments, influenced the interpretation and application of Fundamental Rights as they relate to electoral laws, like the Representation of the People Act. The power to punish for contempt of court is an inherent power of the Supreme Court, vital for maintaining the dignity and authority of the judicial system. The Supreme Court exercises judicial review—the power to examine the constitutionality of laws passed by Parliament.

Option (b) is incorrect because while the Kesavananda Bharati case was a landmark judgment, its primary focus wasn't the interpretation of Directive Principles. The case primarily dealt with the basic structure doctrine of the Constitution. Option (d) is incorrect because, as explained above, the Kesavananda Bharati case did not primarily concern the interpretation of Directive Principles.



**3. With reference to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Dispute                     Jurisdiction
1. Inter-state water disputes          :  Exclusive original jurisdiction
2. Election disputes of the President :  Exclusive jurisdiction
3. Private citizen vs. Centre suits     :  Lacks jurisdiction
4. Cases involving the UPSC            :   Has jurisdiction for inquiry into conduct


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction to decide election disputes concerning the President of India. This is a constitutionally mandated power. The Supreme Court also has the power to inquire into the conduct of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) members, as laid down in the Constitution.

Option (b) is incorrect because the Supreme Court does have original jurisdiction in certain matters but not exclusively in inter-state water disputes.  Option (c) is incorrect because the Supreme Court does hold jurisdiction over disputes involving the UPSC, and does lack jurisdiction over many private citizen vs. Centre suits, but it does have jurisdiction in election disputes of the President.  Option (d) is incorrect as the Supreme Court does have jurisdiction over UPSC conduct.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Doctrine            Supreme Court Application
1. Doctrine of Severability   :   Applied in cases concerning the 42nd Amendment Act
2. Doctrine of Prospective Overruling :  Used in the Kesavananda Bharati case
3. Doctrine of Eclipse           :   Applied to laws conflicting with Fundamental Rights
4. Doctrine of Colourable Legislation:  Used in cases involving State legislative power


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has utilized the doctrine of severability to separate valid and invalid parts of laws, and this was notably relevant during the debates surrounding the 42nd Amendment. The doctrine of prospective overruling, a concept where the court applies a new legal principle only to future cases, has been employed in major constitutional cases including Kesavananda Bharati. The Doctrine of Eclipse renders a pre-constitutional law temporarily inoperative when a conflicting constitutional provision is enacted, but the pre-constitutional law is not invalidated. It is revived once the conflicting constitutional provision is repealed or declared void. This is relevant in the context of Fundamental Rights.


Option (b) is incorrect as the Doctrine of Prospective Overruling was applied in the Kesavananda Bharati case, and the Doctrine of Colourable Legislation is used to review laws that appear to be within the legislative competence of a body but actually serve to circumvent constitutional limitations. Option (d) is incorrect as the Doctrine of Prospective Overruling was applied in the Kesavananda Bharati case.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution    Subject Matter
1. Article 124                     :   Establishment of the Supreme Court
2. Article 143                     :   Advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
3. Article 32                      :   Right to Constitutional Remedies
4. Article 17                       :   Abolition of untouchability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Article 124 of the Indian Constitution deals with the establishment and constitution of the Supreme Court. Article 143 pertains to the advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, allowing the President to seek its opinion on legal matters. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, enabling citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. Article 17 abolishes untouchability, a crucial aspect of social justice.  All pairs are correctly matched.  There are no incorrect pairings.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Official        Action Related to Finance Bill
1. Lok Sabha                       :  Amends the Finance Bill
2. Rajya Sabha                     : Rejects the Finance Bill
3. President of India              :  Introduces the Finance Bill
4. Union Finance Minister          : Presents the Finance Bill to Parliament
5. Speaker of Lok Sabha            : Certifies the Finance Bill as a Money Bill

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha, being the lower house, plays a crucial role in the passage of the Finance Bill. It can amend the bill, and its approval is essential for the bill to become law.  The Union Finance Minister, as part of the government's responsibility for the budget, presents the Finance Bill to the Parliament. The other options are incorrect. While the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations, it cannot reject a Money Bill (of which the Finance Bill is a type). The President doesn't introduce the Finance Bill; the government does through its finance minister.  The President's role is to give assent after the bill's passage through Parliament. The Speaker's role is to certify a bill as a Money Bill, a crucial step in the process, but they do not introduce the bill. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 accurately reflect the roles and actions concerning the Finance Bill.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Official      Power/Responsibility
1. President of India              :  Certifies a bill as a Money Bill
2. Rajya Sabha                     :  Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
3. Lok Sabha                       :  Passes a motion of no-confidence against the Council of Ministers
4. Speaker of Lok Sabha            :  Decides on the disqualification of a Member of Parliament under the anti-defection law
5. Election Commission of India    :  Appoints the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha holds the exclusive power to pass a motion of no-confidence against the Council of Ministers, leading to the government's fall if successful.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as the presiding officer, plays a crucial role in deciding on the disqualification of MPs under the anti-defection law.  The other options incorrectly match the powers.  The President does not certify bills as Money Bills; that's the Speaker of the Lok Sabha's responsibility. The Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, initiates impeachment proceedings against the President. The Election Commission, not the Lok Sabha or any other entity, conducts elections and doesn't appoint the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha; the Lok Sabha itself elects the Deputy Speaker.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Body/Official        Action/Power
1. Rajya Sabha                     : Introduces a Money Bill
2. Lok Sabha                       :  Can reject all recommendations from Rajya Sabha on a Money Bill
3. President of India              :  Must give assent to a Constitutional Amendment Bill
4. Speaker of Lok Sabha            :  Has the final say on whether a bill is a Money Bill
5. Governor                        :  Can reserve a Money Bill for the President's consideration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Speaker of the Lok Sabha holds the final authority to determine whether a bill qualifies as a Money Bill. The Governor of a state has the power to reserve a Money Bill for the President's consideration, which is a key part of the legislative process.  The other pairs are incorrect. Only the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, can introduce a Money Bill. While the Lok Sabha can reject recommendations,  it's not about *all* recommendations; it can selectively accept or reject them. The President has the power to give or withhold assent to Constitutional Amendment Bills, but it's not obligatory.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament             Power/Function
1. Rajya Sabha                     :  Passes a motion of no-confidence
2. Lok Sabha                       :  Can amend or reject a Money Bill
3. Lok Sabha                       :  Ratifies a declaration of emergency
4. Rajya Sabha                     :  Can delay a Money Bill for 14 days
5. Rajya Sabha                     :  Has exclusive power to initiate the removal of the Vice-President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha possesses the power to amend or reject a Money Bill, reflecting its dominance in financial matters. The Rajya Sabha can only delay a Money Bill for a maximum of 14 days; it cannot reject or substantially amend it. The Rajya Sabha holds the exclusive constitutional power to initiate the process of removing the Vice-President. The other options contain mismatched pairs.  Only the Lok Sabha can pass a motion of no-confidence, and only the Lok Sabha ratifies the declaration of a national emergency.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Official/Body    Action/Responsibility
1. Speaker of Lok Sabha           :  Appoints the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha
2. President of India              :  Nominates members to the Rajya Sabha
3. Rajya Sabha                     :  Elects the Deputy Chairman
4. Lok Sabha                       :  Elects the Speaker
5. Election Commission of India    :  Certifies a Bill as a Money Bill


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India nominates members to the Rajya Sabha, a key part of the upper house's composition. The Rajya Sabha elects its Deputy Chairman, and the Lok Sabha elects its Speaker.  The other options are incorrect. The Lok Sabha elects its Deputy Speaker, not the Speaker. The Election Commission of India does not certify bills as Money Bills; the Speaker of Lok Sabha does this.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 correctly match the parliamentary official/body with its action/responsibility.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   President's Action                     Constitutional Provision/Body
1.  Grants pardon to a death sentence convict :  Article 72
2.  Appoints judges to High Courts          :  Article 124
3.  Presents the Union Budget               :  Article 112
4.  Constitutes the GST Council             :  Article 279A
5.  Refers matters to the Supreme Court    :  Article 143


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because:

1. **President's Pardon (Death Sentence):** Article 72 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence.  This includes death sentences.

3. **Presentation of the Union Budget:**  Article 112 deals with the annual financial statement (budget) which is presented to Parliament by the President.

4. **Constitution of the GST Council:** Article 279A establishes the Goods and Services Tax Council, which is constituted by the President.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

2. **Appointment of High Court Judges:** While the President appoints High Court judges, the relevant article is Article 217, not Article 124 (which pertains to the Supreme Court).

5. **Referring Matters to Supreme Court:** The President can refer matters to the Supreme Court for its opinion under Article 143, but this is not an exclusive power and does not define the entire relationship. The question requires a precise matching of action and constitutional provision.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   President's Power/Function              Nature of Power/Function
1.  Veto power over bills                   :  Suspensive Veto
2.  Addressing joint sessions of Parliament :  Constitutional Duty
3.  Appointing the Governor                :  Discretionary Power
4.  Dissolving the Lok Sabha               :  On the advice of the Prime Minister
5.  Granting pardons                       :  Absolute Power


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because:

2. **Addressing Parliament:** The President's address to joint sessions of Parliament is a constitutionally mandated function.

4. **Dissolving Lok Sabha:** Though the President technically dissolves the Lok Sabha, this power is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister, making it a power exercised on advice, not a discretionary one.

5. **Granting Pardons:**  The President's power to grant pardons is generally considered absolute, as the Constitution doesn't provide for any review of such decisions.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatches:

1. **Veto Power:** The President possesses a suspensive veto, not an absolute veto.  An absolute veto would mean the President's refusal to sign a bill would be final, while a suspensive veto allows the bill to be passed with a special majority.

3. **Appointing the Governor:** The President appoints the Governor, but this appointment is largely based on the advice of the Council of Ministers; the question seeks a precise classification of the function.



**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Primary Function
1.  Union Public Service Commission       :   Conducts examinations for All India Services
2.  Finance Commission                    :   Recommends distribution of tax revenue
3.  National Human Rights Commission    :   Investigates human rights violations
4.  Election Commission of India            :   Supervises elections to the Lok Sabha
5.  Central Vigilance Commission          :   Deals with corruption complaints


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct as:


1. **UPSC and All India Services:** The UPSC's primary role is conducting recruitment examinations for All India Services and other central government positions.

2. **Finance Commission and Tax Revenue:** The Finance Commission's core function is to recommend the principles governing the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and the States.

4. **Election Commission and Lok Sabha:** The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections, including those for the Lok Sabha.

5. **CVC and Corruption:** The Central Vigilance Commission's primary role is to address corruption complaints within the central government.


Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

3. **NHRC and Human Rights:** Although the NHRC investigates human rights violations, its primary function is to examine and address human rights issues, not solely investigations.  The question demands a precise match.



**4. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

  Type of Bill                        House of Origin
1.  Money Bill                          :   Rajya Sabha
2.  Financial Bill (not a Money Bill) :   Lok Sabha
3.  Constitutional Amendment Bill     :   Either House
4.  Private Member's Bill                :   Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because:

2. **Financial Bill (not Money Bill):** While a Money Bill originates exclusively in the Lok Sabha, a Financial Bill (which is not solely a Money Bill as defined in Article 110) can be introduced in either House.

3. **Constitutional Amendment Bill:** The Constitution allows for the introduction of a Constitutional Amendment Bill in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.


Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatches:

1. **Money Bill:** Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.

4. **Private Member's Bill:** While private members' bills can be introduced in either house, the question asks for the origin, making the statement imprecise.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Political Institution/Body        Specific Power/Function
1.  Lok Sabha                       :   Removal of the President
2.  Rajya Sabha                     :   Creation of All-India Services
3.  Supreme Court                   :   Judicial Review of Presidential Ordinances
4.  President of India               :   Appoints the Chief Justice of India
5.  Finance Commission              :   Recommends the distribution of tax revenue


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because:

2. **Rajya Sabha and All-India Services:**  The Rajya Sabha has the power to pass a resolution authorizing Parliament to create new All-India Services (Article 312).

4. **President and Chief Justice:** The President appoints the Chief Justice of India, usually the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court.

5. **Finance Commission and Tax Revenue:** The Finance Commission's primary function is to recommend the distribution of the net proceeds of certain taxes and duties between the Union and the States.


Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because of mismatches:

1. **Lok Sabha and President's Removal:**  The Lok Sabha plays a significant role in the impeachment process of the President, but the Rajya Sabha is equally involved.  The question demands a precise single power.

3. **Supreme Court and Presidential Ordinances:** The Supreme Court can review the constitutionality of laws, but  the question seeks a specific link between the Supreme Court and the President's ordinance-making power; this is not a direct, exclusive function of the Supreme Court.  Judicial review of ordinances is possible, but not a specific power exclusively held by the Supreme Court.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Money Bills and related parliamentary procedures.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level, offering detailed explanations for the correct answers and analyses of the distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body          Action Regarding Money Bill
1. Rajya Sabha               : Can introduce a Money Bill
2. Lok Sabha                 :  Can amend a Money Bill after Rajya Sabha's consideration
3. President of India        :  Can withhold assent to a Money Bill
4. Speaker of Lok Sabha     :  Certifies a Bill as a Money Bill
5. Legislative Assembly      : Introduces a Money Bill

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India's power to withhold assent to a Money Bill is a crucial safeguard in the Indian parliamentary system.  While the President generally acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, this power allows for a final check on legislation, especially crucial in financial matters.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha plays a vital role in certifying a bill as a Money Bill, a decision that is final and cannot be challenged. This certification is based on the definition of a Money Bill as laid down in Article 110 of the Constitution.

Option 1 is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha cannot introduce a Money Bill; only the Lok Sabha can. Option 2 is incorrect as the Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill; it can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject. Option 5 is incorrect because while state legislatures can introduce Money Bills concerning state finances, the question refers to the Parliament of India.


**2. With reference to the passage of Money Bills in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body         Power/Role
1. Rajya Sabha              :  Can delay a Money Bill for a maximum of 14 days.
2. Lok Sabha                :  Has the sole power to initiate a Money Bill.
3. President of India       :  Must recommend a Money Bill before its introduction.
4. Speaker of Lok Sabha    :  Decides whether a bill is a Money Bill or not.
5. Council of Ministers     : Introduces a Money Bill in Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Rajya Sabha's power to delay a Money Bill for 14 days is a significant feature designed to allow for scrutiny without giving it veto power.  The Lok Sabha's exclusive power to initiate Money Bills underlines its primary role in financial matters. The President's recommendation before introduction is a constitutional requirement, ensuring executive involvement in financial legislation. The Speaker's final authority on certifying a bill as a Money Bill ensures the smooth functioning of the process.  The Council of Ministers, as the executive branch, is responsible for introducing the Money Bill, reflecting the government's budgetary proposals.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Article      Provision Related to Money Bills
1. Article 109                :  Details the procedure for passing a Money Bill in the Rajya Sabha
2. Article 110                : Defines what constitutes a Money Bill
3. Article 111                : Outlines the President's assent to Money Bills
4. Article 266                : Deals with the Consolidated Fund of India's custody
5. Article 267                : Deals with the Contingency Fund of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 110 precisely defines a Money Bill, differentiating it from other bills. Article 111 details the President's role in assenting to a Money Bill, including the limited power of the Rajya Sabha.  Article 266 deals with the custody of the Consolidated Fund of India, relevant to Money Bills as they often deal with appropriations from this fund.

Option 1 is incorrect; Article 109 outlines the procedure for passing a Money Bill in both Houses, but with a focus on the Lok Sabha's dominance. Option 5 is incorrect; Article 267 relates to the Contingency Fund of India, which might be involved in some Money Bills but is not the central defining feature of their nature.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill              Characteristic
1. Money Bill               : Can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.
2. Financial Bill           :  Always deals with the appropriation of moneys.
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill : Requires a special majority for passage.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only the statement regarding the Constitutional Amendment Bill is correct.  Constitutional Amendment Bills require a special majority for passage in both houses of Parliament.

Option 1 is incorrect; a Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. Option 2 is incorrect; while a Financial Bill often deals with the appropriation of moneys, it is not always the case. A Financial Bill can encompass other financial matters beyond mere appropriation.


**5. With reference to the Indian Parliament's financial powers, consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee       Function
1. Public Accounts Committee    : Examines the expenditure of the government after it has been incurred.
2. Estimates Committee         :  Scrutinizes the budget before it is presented to the Parliament.
3. Committee on Public Undertakings : Reviews the performance of Public Sector Undertakings.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) examines government expenditure *after* it has been incurred, ensuring accountability. The Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU) reviews the performance of PSUs, a crucial aspect of financial oversight.

Option 2 is incorrect; the Estimates Committee scrutinizes the budget *before* its presentation to Parliament, not after.  The function described in option 2 is actually performed by the Estimates Committee.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Parliament of India and related entities.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                    Key Function/Characteristic
1. Lok Sabha                              :   Permanent House
2. Rajya Sabha                             :   Initiates Money Bills
3. Lok Sabha                              :   Elected by Proportional Representation
4. Rajya Sabha                             :   One-third members retire every two years
5. Lok Sabha                              :  Has the power to remove the Council of Ministers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because statement 4 and 5 are correctly matched.  Rajya Sabha is a continuing body, meaning it's not subject to dissolution like the Lok Sabha; one-third of its members retire every two years, ensuring continuity and gradual change in membership. The Lok Sabha, on the other hand, holds the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion, reflecting its crucial role in the parliamentary system.

Statement 1 is incorrect as Lok Sabha is not a permanent house, it is dissolved after a fixed term. Statement 2 is incorrect because Rajya Sabha cannot initiate money bills; they are introduced only in Lok Sabha. Statement 3 is incorrect; Lok Sabha uses the First-Past-The-Post system, not proportional representation.


**2. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Official         Specific Power or Role
1. President of India                   :   Presides over joint sessions of Parliament
2. Speaker of Lok Sabha                 :   Certifies a bill as a Money Bill
3. Rajya Sabha Chairman                 :   Nominates members to the Lok Sabha
4.  Finance Minister                     :   Presents the Union Budget to Parliament
5.  Department of Revenue                 :   Dissolves the Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The President presides over joint sittings of Parliament when there's a deadlock between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the authority to certify a bill as a Money Bill. The Union Finance Minister is responsible for preparing and presenting the Union Budget.

Option (c) is incorrect because the Department of Revenue prepares the budget, but the Finance Minister presents it. The Rajya Sabha Chairman does not nominate members to the Lok Sabha; the President does.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Entity/Process           Associated Constitutional Provision
1. Consolidated Fund of India         :   Article 112
2. Contingency Fund of India          :   Article 265
3. Public Account of India             :   Article 266
4. Vote on Account                     :   Article 360
5. Demands for Grants                  :   Article 114


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The Consolidated Fund of India is established under Article 266 of the Constitution.  Demands for Grants are detailed in Article 114, outlining the procedure for Parliament to approve government spending.

Option (a) is incorrect as Article 112 deals with the Annual Financial Statement (budget), not the Consolidated Fund. Article 265 prohibits the imposition of taxes without authorization from the relevant legislative body (Parliament or State Legislature). Article 266 deals with the Consolidated Fund. Article 360 concerns Financial Emergency.


**4. With reference to the Indian parliamentary system, consider the following pairs:**

    Parliamentary Committee             Primary Function
1. Public Accounts Committee          :   Examines the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)
2. Estimates Committee                 :   Scrutinizes the reports of the Public Accounts Committee
3. Committee on Public Undertakings   :   Examines the accounts of government-owned companies
4. Committee on Subordinate Legislation:  Reviews the exercise of delegated legislative powers by the executive
5. Committee on Petitions              :   Deals with petitions received from the public


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The Public Accounts Committee examines CAG reports. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation scrutinizes delegated legislation. The Committee on Petitions deals with public petitions.

The Estimates Committee examines government estimates, not PAC reports (Option c and d are incorrect). The Committee on Public Undertakings examines the work of Public Sector Undertakings but not necessarily their accounts alone (Option b and d are incorrect).


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Amendment Act        Significant Change Related to Parliament
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976           :   Introduced the concept of the "anti-defection law"
2. 44th Amendment Act, 1978           :   Restored the original six-year term of the Lok Sabha
3. 52nd Amendment Act, 1985           :   Introduced the concept of a "special majority" for constitutional amendments
4. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992           :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
5. 87th Amendment Act, 2003           :   Made education a Fundamental Right


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is the correct answer. The 73rd Amendment Act, 1992, is directly related to establishing Panchayati Raj Institutions.

The 42nd Amendment Act introduced several changes, including the addition of "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble but not the anti-defection law. The 44th Amendment Act restored the original five-year term of the Lok Sabha. The 52nd Amendment did introduce the concept of special majority, but not as directly linked to Parliament as the 73rd Amendment. The 86th Amendment made education a Fundamental Right.


These questions test factual recall, analytical skills, and the ability to identify correct linkages between different aspects of the Indian parliamentary system.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of each pair.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                Specific Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                           :   Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
2. Rajya Sabha                         :   Exclusive power to initiate removal of the Vice-President
3. Lok Sabha                           :   Only house where Money Bills can originate
4. Rajya Sabha                         :   Can delay but not reject Money Bills
5. Lok Sabha                           :   Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to this house


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Lok Sabha holds the primary power to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President; the Rajya Sabha has the sole authority to start the process of removing the Vice-President.  Money Bills, which deal with financial matters, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  While the Rajya Sabha can review and suggest amendments to Money Bills, it cannot ultimately reject them. The Lok Sabha's power is supreme in this regard. Finally, the Council of Ministers is constitutionally responsible to the Lok Sabha; a vote of no confidence can only be moved in the Lok Sabha, leading to the potential resignation or dismissal of the government.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                 Specific Function
1. Finance Commission                  :   Recommends principles for determining taxes for Panchayats
2. Union Public Service Commission    :   Conducts examinations for civil services
3. Election Commission of India        :   Conducts elections for both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
4. Comptroller and Auditor General     :   Audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments
5. National Human Rights Commission   :   Investigates human rights violations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission is responsible for recommending the principles governing the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States, including those for Panchayats.  The UPSC conducts examinations for recruitment to civil services. The Election Commission conducts elections for both houses of Parliament and State Assemblies.  The CAG audits government accounts.  The NHRC investigates human rights violations. Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Action               House of Parliament with Primary Power
1.  Passage of Money Bills          :   Rajya Sabha
2.  Introduction of Money Bills     :   Lok Sabha
3.  Initiation of No-Confidence Motion :   Rajya Sabha
4.  Impeachment of the President    :   Lok Sabha
5.  Amendment of the Constitution  :   Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  The Lok Sabha initiates impeachment proceedings against the President.  The Lok Sabha also has the primary power to introduce Constitutional amendment bills, although the Rajya Sabha can also participate.  The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to initiate a no-confidence motion and a money bill cannot be initiated in the Rajya Sabha. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                      House of Parliament with Special Power
1. Money Bill                         :   Rajya Sabha can reject it
2. Financial Bill (not a Money Bill) :   Rajya Sabha has equal power with Lok Sabha
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill     :   Rajya Sabha has equal power with Lok Sabha
4. Ordinary Bill                      :   Rajya Sabha has equal power with Lok Sabha
5. Appropriation Bill                 :  Rajya Sabha can initiate it


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill; it can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.  Financial Bills (other than Money Bills), Constitutional Amendment Bills, and Ordinary Bills are subject to the approval of both houses. Option 5 is incorrect as Rajya Sabha cannot initiate an appropriation bill. Option 1 is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill. Option (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governmental Body              Specific Responsibility
1. Cabinet Secretariat              :   Allocation of financial resources to Ministries
2. Department of Revenue            :   Preparation and presentation of the Union Budget
3. Union Finance Minister           :   Advising the President on financial matters
4. Comptroller and Auditor General :   Auditing the accounts of the Union Government
5. National Development Council     :   Formulating five-year plans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Department of Revenue is primarily involved in the preparation of the Union Budget. The Comptroller and Auditor General audits the accounts of the Union Government. The National Development Council plays a key role in the formulation of five-year plans.  The Cabinet Secretariat does not allocate financial resources, that function rests with the Finance Ministry. The Union Finance Minister is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to the Parliament and advises the President on financial matters but not solely on them. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee            Specific Function
1. Committee on Public Accounts       :   Examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General
2. Committee on Estimates             :   Examines the estimates included in the Union Budget
3. Committee on Public Undertakings   :   Examines the working of public sector undertakings
4. Committee on Petitions             :   Examines the petitions received from the public
5. Business Advisory Committee       :   Allocates time for discussion in Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Each committee performs the function described in the corresponding pair. The Committee on Public Accounts scrutinizes the CAG's reports. The Committee on Estimates reviews budget estimates. The Committee on Public Undertakings examines the functioning of public sector enterprises.  The Committee on Petitions considers petitions from citizens.  The Business Advisory Committee manages the parliamentary agenda.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Emergency                 Power of Parliament During Emergency
1. National Emergency                :   Parliament can legislate on State List matters
2. Financial Emergency               :   Parliament can issue directions to States on financial matters
3. President’s Rule (Article 356)    :   Parliament can amend the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

During a National Emergency, Parliament's legislative powers extend to subjects in the State List. During a Financial Emergency, Parliament can direct states to implement certain financial measures.  While President's Rule can lead to legislative changes, it does not automatically grant the power to amend the Constitution. The power to amend the constitution is a separate provision, not solely activated during President's Rule. Option (a) is incorrect as it does not include the correctly matched pair 2. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair 3. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair 3.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision          Enforcement Mechanism
1. Fundamental Rights                :   Judicial review by the Supreme Court
2. Directive Principles of State Policy:   Judicial enforcement by the High Courts
3. Fundamental Duties                :   Legislative process to enforce these duties


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  Fundamental Rights are justiciable, meaning they can be enforced through judicial review by the Supreme Court. Directive Principles are not directly enforceable by courts, although they guide government policy.  While there is a moral obligation associated with Fundamental Duties, there isn't a specific legal mechanism to enforce them. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Special Status of a Body           Feature of the Body
1.  State Finance Commission         :   Constituted under the Constitution of India
2.  National Human Rights Commission :   Constituted by an Act of Parliament
3.  Election Commission of India      :   Constituted under the Constitution of India
4.  Finance Commission                 :   Appointed by the President of India
5.  National Green Tribunal           :   Constituted by an Act of Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The State Finance Commission is a constitutional body, established under the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution. The Election Commission of India is also a constitutional body. The Finance Commission is appointed by the President. The NGT is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament. The National Human Rights Commission is also a statutory body established by an act of parliament. Option (a) is incorrect because it does not include pair 5. Option (b) is incorrect because it does not include pairs 1 and 4. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes pair 2 which is incorrect.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governmental Process            House of Parliament with Primary Power
1.  Approval of Demands for Grants :   Rajya Sabha
2.  Introduction of Appropriation Bill :   Lok Sabha
3.  Passing of a No-Confidence Motion:   Lok Sabha
4.  Approval of Proclamation of Emergency:   Rajya Sabha
5.  Impeachment of the President:   Rajya Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Lok Sabha has the exclusive power to introduce and pass appropriation bills.  The Lok Sabha also holds the sole power to pass a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers.  The Rajya Sabha cannot initiate a no-confidence motion or pass an appropriation bill. The Lok Sabha has the primary power in the approval of demands for grants and proclamation of emergency. The Lok Sabha initiates impeachment proceedings against the president.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Feature                      Specific Detail
1.  Speaker's Appointment               :  Elected by Lok Sabha members
2.  Term Length                          :  Five years, unless dissolved earlier
3.  Number of Nominated Members         : Two, representing Anglo-Indian community (if needed)
4.  House where Money Bills originate   : Lok Sabha
5.  Body that conducts Lok Sabha elections: Election Commission of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by the Lok Sabha members themselves, making option 1 correct.  The normal term of the Lok Sabha is five years, although it can be dissolved earlier by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister; thus, option 2 is also correct. Money Bills, as per the Indian Constitution, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, making option 4 correct. The Election Commission of India is the body responsible for conducting elections to the Lok Sabha, confirming option 5.

Option 3 is incorrect. While the President can nominate two members to the Lok Sabha to represent the Anglo-Indian community if, in the President's opinion, that community is not adequately represented, this is not a fixed number and contingent upon the President's judgment.  Therefore,  it's not a consistently accurate pairing.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Action                     Resulting Consequence
1. Passage of a No-Confidence Motion : Dissolution of the Council of Ministers
2. Defeat of a Money Bill              : Government Resignation
3.  Approval of President's Address    :  Formal commencement of the session
4. Rejection of Budget                   : Government Resignation
5. Impeachment Motion Defeat          : President remains in office


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

A successful no-confidence motion leads to the resignation of the Council of Ministers, making option 1 correct. The President's address marks the formal beginning of a Lok Sabha session, thus option 3 is correct. A failed impeachment motion means the President remains in office, making option 5 correct.

Option 2 is incorrect.  The defeat of a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha would be highly unusual and doesn't automatically trigger a government resignation.  While it could lead to political instability and potentially a resignation, it's not a direct and guaranteed consequence. Option 4 is incorrect.  Rejection of the budget, while creating political difficulties, does not automatically lead to a government resignation.  The government may try to renegotiate or modify the budget.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Committee                     Function
1. Committee on Estimates                : Scrutinizes government expenditure
2.  Business Advisory Committee         :  Schedules the business of the House
3.  Public Accounts Committee             : Examines audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General
4.  Committee on Private Members' Bills:  Examines bills introduced by private members
5.  Committee on Privileges              : Deals with breaches of parliamentary privilege


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 1, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Committee on Estimates scrutinizes government expenditure before it is incurred. The Business Advisory Committee sets the agenda and allocates time for parliamentary business. The Public Accounts Committee examines the CAG reports on government spending. The Committee on Private Members' Bills deals with bills introduced by individual MPs. The Committee on Privileges investigates breaches of parliamentary privilege. There are no inaccuracies or misleading information in any of the pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Role                           Constitutional Provision
1.  Power to impeach the President       : Article 61
2.  Power to declare Financial Emergency: Article 360
3.  Power to approve the budget          : Article 112
4.  Power to elect the President         : Article 54
5.  Power to pass a no-confidence motion: Article 75


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha's role in impeaching the President is enshrined in Article 61, making option 1 correct.  The Lok Sabha's power to approve the budget is detailed in Article 112, making option 3 correct. Article 54 outlines the Lok Sabha's role in the election of the President, making option 4 correct.

Option 2 is incorrect.  While the Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in considering the proclamation of a Financial Emergency, it doesn't possess the sole power to *declare* it; that power rests with the President. Option 5 is incorrect.  The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention a "no-confidence motion" but rather the principle of the Council of Ministers' collective responsibility to the Lok Sabha, which is the basis for such motions.  The article cited (Article 75) deals with the appointment of the Council of Ministers.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Characteristic              Description
1.  Lower House of Parliament           :  Directly elected representatives of the people
2.  Composition                         :  Includes elected members from States and Union Territories
3.  Dissolution                         :  Can be dissolved by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister
4.  Special Majority Requirement        :  Required for certain constitutional amendments
5.  Presided Over By                     : Speaker, elected by the House


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The Lok Sabha is the lower house of Parliament and its members are directly elected by the people of India. It comprises elected representatives from states and union territories.  The President, on the advice of the Prime Minister, can dissolve the Lok Sabha. A special majority is needed for certain constitutional amendments. The Lok Sabha is presided over by the Speaker, who is elected by the House.  There are no inaccuracies or ambiguities in the provided pairs.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Rajya Sabha Feature                      Specific Detail
1.  Chairman's Appointment               : Vice President of India (ex officio)
2.  Term Length                          : Six years, with one-third retiring every two years
3.  Number of Nominated Members         : Twelve, nominated by the President
4.  Power to introduce Money Bills        :  No power to introduce Money Bills
5.  Body that conducts Rajya Sabha elections: Election Commission of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Vice President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, making option 1 correct.  The Rajya Sabha has a six-year term, with one-third of its members retiring every two years, making option 2 correct. Money Bills cannot originate in the Rajya Sabha, only in the Lok Sabha, making option 4 correct.  The Election Commission of India conducts elections to the Rajya Sabha, making option 5 correct.

Option 3 is incorrect. While the President nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha,  this is a specific number unlike the nominated members of the Lok Sabha, which are contingent on the President's judgement.  The number is fixed and therefore a more accurate pairing.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Rajya Sabha Power                        Specific Application
1.  Power to amend a Money Bill           : Can only make recommendations, not reject or amend substantially
2.  Power to initiate a removal motion for the Vice-President: Sole power to initiate such a motion
3.  Power to discuss the Budget           : Can discuss, but cannot vote on Demands for Grants
4.  Power to approve a Proclamation of Emergency: Can delay but not block a proclamation during Lok Sabha dissolution
5.  Power to create new All-India Services:  Can authorize the Parliament to do so


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

All pairs accurately reflect the powers and functions of the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments to Money Bills; it cannot reject or substantially alter them.  It has the exclusive right to initiate the removal process for the Vice President. The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget but cannot vote on the Demands for Grants.  If the Lok Sabha is dissolved, the Rajya Sabha's approval of an emergency proclamation is sufficient to keep it in effect.  The Rajya Sabha can authorize Parliament to create new All-India Services.  There are no inaccuracies in the provided pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Privilege                  Description
1.  Freedom of Speech in Parliament     :  Members are immune from legal action for statements made in Parliament
2.  Publication of Proceedings           :  Houses can publish their proceedings, subject to limitations
3.  Protection from Arrest                : Members have limited protection from arrest during sessions
4.  Right to Information from Government:  Parliament can compel the executive to provide information
5.  Power to Punish Contempt               :  Houses can punish those who breach their privileges


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately describes a parliamentary privilege.  Members of Parliament enjoy freedom of speech within the confines of parliamentary procedure and are protected from legal action for statements made during debates.  Parliamentary bodies have the right to publish their proceedings, though this right is subject to certain limitations (e.g., regarding classified information).  Members enjoy protection from arrest during parliamentary sessions (with some exceptions). Parliament possesses the power to demand information from the executive branch.  Finally, both houses of Parliament can punish individuals for contempt. All aspects are accurate representations of parliamentary privileges.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legislative Body                     Presiding Officer
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Deputy Speaker
2. Rajya Sabha                           :   Chairman
3. State Legislative Assembly           :   Governor
4. State Legislative Council             :   Speaker Pro Tem

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, is presided over by the Chairman, who is the Vice-President of India ex-officio.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Lok Sabha is presided over by the Speaker, not the Deputy Speaker. While the Governor is the head of a state's executive, they do not preside over the state legislative assembly; that role belongs to the Speaker.  A Speaker Pro Tem is a temporary presiding officer, usually appointed to conduct the initial proceedings of a newly constituted legislative body until a permanent Speaker is elected, hence, they do not permanently preside over a Legislative Council.  The incorrect pairings highlight common misconceptions about the roles and responsibilities of various presiding officers within the Indian legislative system.  Understanding the distinctions between these roles is crucial for comprehending the structure and functioning of Indian governance.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    House of Parliament                 Characteristic
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Permanent House
2. Rajya Sabha                           :   Represents States and Union Territories
3. Lok Sabha                             :   Elected by Proportional Representation
4. Rajya Sabha                           :   Can initiate Money Bills

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, indeed represents the states and union territories of India.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Lok Sabha is not a permanent house; it is dissolved after a fixed term. The Lok Sabha employs the first-past-the-post system, not proportional representation.  Finally, the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, has the exclusive power to initiate Money Bills. The incorrect options serve as distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the fundamental differences between the two houses of Parliament. This question assesses factual recall and conceptual understanding of the Indian parliamentary system.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body                  Function
1. Election Commission                :   Delimits constituencies
2. Union Public Service Commission   :   Appoints judges of High Courts
3. Comptroller and Auditor General     :   Audits accounts of the Union and States
4. Finance Commission                   :   Allocates seats in Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Election Commission of India is responsible for delimiting constituencies for elections. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits the accounts of both the Union and State governments.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the President appoints High Court judges, not the UPSC.  Pair 4 is also incorrect; the Parliament, based on census data and following a prescribed formula, allocates seats in the Lok Sabha.  The incorrect options highlight the different roles of these constitutional bodies, demanding a clear understanding of their respective functions and responsibilities within the Indian governmental framework.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish the roles of various constitutional bodies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment Act                         Impact on Lok Sabha
1. 61st Amendment Act, 1988           :   Increased the number of seats
2. 84th Amendment Act, 2001           :   Froze seat allocation till 2026
3. 87th Amendment Act, 2003           :   Allowed delimitation based on 2001 census without altering state-wise allocation
4. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976           :   Reduced the voting age to 18

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The 84th Amendment Act, 2001, extended the freeze on Lok Sabha seat readjustment (initially imposed by the 42nd Amendment) until 2026. The 87th Amendment Act, 2003, permitted delimitation based on the 2001 census but without changing the total number of seats assigned to each state.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the 61st Amendment Act lowered the voting age, not increased Lok Sabha seats.  Pair 4 is incorrect; the 61st Amendment reduced the voting age to 18, not the 42nd Amendment.  The incorrect pairs test knowledge of specific amendment acts and their impact on the composition of the Lok Sabha, requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article of the Constitution          Subject Matter
1. Article 265                         :   Contingency Fund of India
2. Article 266                         :   Consolidated Fund of India
3. Article 267                         :   Public Account of India
4. Article 356                         :   President's Rule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Article 266 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Consolidated Fund of India. Article 267 defines the Contingency Fund of India. Article 266 deals with the Public Account of India, and Article 356 outlines the President's power to impose President's Rule in a state.  Pair 1 is incorrect; Article 265 deals with the prohibition of taxes, not the Contingency Fund. The other correct pairs highlight the constitutional provisions related to crucial financial aspects and emergency powers of the Indian government, demanding a strong understanding of the constitutional framework.  This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of constitutional provisions relating to finance and governance.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Parliamentary Committee                Function
1. Committee on Public Undertakings      :   Scrutinizes the reports of the CAG
2. Estimates Committee                    :   Examines the annual budget
3. Public Accounts Committee              :   Reviews subordinate legislation
4. Committee on Subordinate Legislation :   Examines the accounts of public sector undertakings


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Committee on Public Undertakings scrutinizes the working of public sector undertakings and their reports, often involving examination of the CAG's findings.  The Estimates Committee examines the annual budget and suggests improvements in government expenditure. The Public Accounts Committee scrutinizes the reports of the CAG, not subordinate legislation. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation reviews subordinate legislation, not the accounts of public sector undertakings.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the functions of various parliamentary committees, requiring detailed factual recall and analytical skills to differentiate between closely related functions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bill                          Characteristic
1. Money Bill                             :   Can only be introduced in Rajya Sabha
2. Financial Bill                         :   Requires President's recommendation for introduction
3. Ordinary Bill                          :   Can originate in either House
4. Constitutional Amendment Bill       :   Requires special majority in both Houses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Financial Bills require the President's recommendation before introduction. Ordinary Bills can originate in either the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. Constitutional Amendment Bills require a special majority in both Houses for passage.  Pair 1 is incorrect; Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.  The incorrect pair serves as a strong distractor, testing the knowledge of the unique procedures for different types of bills in the Indian Parliament. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish the procedures for different types of bills.  It also requires a conceptual understanding of the legislative process.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    House of Parliament                  Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Exclusive power to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President
2. Rajya Sabha                           :   Power to amend Money Bills
3. Lok Sabha                             :   Power to initiate no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers
4. Rajya Sabha                           :   Power to introduce Money Bills


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Lok Sabha holds the exclusive power to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President. The Lok Sabha can also initiate a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to amend Money Bills; it can only review and suggest amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject. The Rajya Sabha cannot introduce Money Bills; that power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha.  This question tests the understanding of the relative powers of the two houses of Parliament, demanding a clear understanding of their respective roles in the legislative and impeachment processes.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between the powers of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article                Provision
1. Article 72                            :   President's power to pardon
2. Article 161                           :   Governor's power to pardon
3. Article 356                           :   President's power to dissolve State Legislative Assemblies
4. Article 365                           :   Governor's power to reserve bills for President’s consideration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Article 72 grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc. Article 161 grants similar powers to the Governor of a state. Article 365 deals with the failure of a state to comply with directions from the Union, not the power to dissolve the assembly (that is under Article 356). Article 365 empowers the President to issue directions to a state, which can include the Governor reserving bills for Presidential consideration.  Pair 3 is incorrect; Article 356 deals with the President's power to impose President's Rule, which may or may not include the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.  This question tests the knowledge of specific constitutional articles and their relation to executive powers at the Union and state levels, demanding precise factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Supreme Court Power                 Related Constitutional Article
1. Original Jurisdiction                 :   Article 131
2. Appellate Jurisdiction in Civil Cases :   Article 133
3. Power of Judicial Review             :   Article 141
4. Power to Issue Writs                 :   Article 32


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Article 131 grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in specified matters.  Article 133 deals with its appellate jurisdiction in civil cases. Article 141 declares the law declared by the Supreme Court to be binding on all courts, but not the power of judicial review itself, which is a broader concept derived from the interpretation of various articles. Article 32 grants the Supreme Court the power to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights, not all types of writs.  This question tests the knowledge of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction and powers as defined in the Constitution, demanding precise knowledge of specific constitutional provisions. The distractors test the understanding of the broader implications of judicial review and writ jurisdiction.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Program          Key Feature
1. MGNREGA                     :   Cost sharing with States
2. Swachh Bharat Mission II    :   Creation of capital assets
3. Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA)    :   Addresses income disparities
4. RTE Act                      :   Converges with MGNREGA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) involves cost-sharing between the central and state governments, with the Centre bearing a larger share of the expenditure.  This makes option 1 correct.  The Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a water conservation program, indirectly addresses income disparities by improving water availability in rural areas, thereby impacting agricultural productivity and livelihood opportunities. This makes option 3 correct. Option 2 is incorrect because the creation of capital assets is a primary outcome of MGNREGA, not Swachh Bharat Mission II. While both aim for rural development, their core focuses differ.  Swachh Bharat Mission II primarily centers on sanitation and hygiene. Option 4 is incorrect as the convergence between Swachh Bharat Mission II and MGNREGA is a notable aspect of their implementation, not a core feature of the RTE Act, which focuses on the right to education. The RTE Act's primary objective is to ensure free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body           Characteristic
1. Council of States           :   Maximum representation from Union Territories
2. Lok Sabha                  :   Permanent body
3. Rajya Sabha                :   Initiates proceedings for the removal of the President
4. Upper House                :   Contributes members to the Committee on Official Language

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Council of States, also known as the Rajya Sabha, is a permanent body, unlike the Lok Sabha which is subject to dissolution.  This makes option 2 incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot initiate impeachment proceedings against the President; this power rests solely with the Lok Sabha. This makes option 3 incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to exclusively determine the maximum representation from Union Territories; this is determined by the Parliament. This makes option 1 incorrect. The Rajya Sabha contributes members to the Committee on Official Language. This makes option 4 correct. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Program                  Associated Objective
1. MGNREGA                     :   RTE Act implementation
2. Swachh Bharat Mission II    :   Poverty alleviation
3. National Health Mission (NHM) :   Income disparities reduction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

MGNREGA is not directly linked to the implementation of the RTE Act. While both contribute to rural development, their objectives are distinct. MGNREGA focuses on employment generation, while the RTE Act focuses on education. This makes option 1 incorrect. The Swachh Bharat Mission II aims to improve sanitation and hygiene, which indirectly contributes to poverty alleviation by improving health and living conditions.  This makes option 2 correct.  The National Health Mission (NHM) primarily focuses on improving healthcare, but it doesn't directly address income disparities as its primary objective. While better health can contribute to increased earning potential,  the core aim is healthcare access and quality. This makes option 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Body          Specific Power
1. Lok Sabha                  :   Recommend creation of a new All India Service
2. Rajya Sabha                :   Exclusive power in relation to removal of the President
3. Council of States           :   Right to regulate internal matters of Parliament
4. Upper House                :   Casting vote in case of a tie

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha does not have the exclusive power to recommend the creation of a new All India Service; this power is shared with the Rajya Sabha.  This makes option 1 incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the exclusive power to initiate the removal of the President; this power exclusively belongs to the Lok Sabha. This makes option 2 incorrect.  The power to regulate the internal matters of Parliament is a collective privilege of both Houses, not exclusive to the Council of States (Rajya Sabha). This makes option 3 incorrect. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha (and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha) has the power to cast a deciding vote in the event of a tie.  This makes option 4 correct.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Procedure     House Where Primarily Used
1. No-Confidence Motion      :   Rajya Sabha
2. Censure Motion             :   Lok Sabha
3. Adjournment Motion         :   Joint Sitting of Parliament
4. Cut Motion                 :   Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

A no-confidence motion can only be moved in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. This makes option 1 incorrect.  Censure motions can be moved in both Houses, but are more commonly used in the Lok Sabha.  This makes option 2 correct. Adjournment motions are used in individual houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), not in a joint sitting. This makes option 3 incorrect. Cut motions are primarily used in the Lok Sabha during the budget session. This makes option 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article       Provision
1. Article 100                  :   Speaker's casting vote
2. Article 110                  :   Definition of Money Bill
3. Article 105                  :   Freedom from arrest
4. Article 117                  :   Special majority requirements


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 100 of the Indian Constitution deals with the quorum and voting procedures in the Houses of Parliament, including the Speaker's casting vote in case of a tie. This makes option 1 correct. Article 110 precisely defines what constitutes a Money Bill, which has specific implications for its passage through Parliament. This makes option 2 correct. Article 105 outlines the privileges and immunities of Members of Parliament, including freedom from arrest in certain circumstances. This makes option 3 correct.  Article 117 does not deal with special majority requirements; those are scattered across various articles depending on the type of amendment or legislation. This makes option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    House of Parliament        Procedure
1. Lok Sabha                  :   Initiation of Money Bills
2. Rajya Sabha                :   Removal of the President
3. Parliament                  :   Joint Sitting
4. Lok Sabha                  :   Vote of No Confidence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Money Bills, according to Article 110, must originate in the Lok Sabha. This makes option 1 correct.  The Lok Sabha holds the sole power to initiate impeachment proceedings for the removal of the President. This makes option 2 incorrect. A joint sitting of Parliament is a procedure that can be invoked when there is a disagreement between the two Houses on a non-money bill.  This makes option 3 correct. A vote of no confidence is a motion moved only in the Lok Sabha to express lack of confidence in the Council of Ministers. This makes option 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body         Final Authority on Disqualification
1. Lok Sabha                  :   Speaker of the Lok Sabha
2. Rajya Sabha                :   Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
3. State Legislature           :   Governor of the State
4. Parliament                  :   President of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is the final authority to decide on questions relating to the disqualification of a member of the Lok Sabha. This makes option 1 correct. Similarly, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha is the final authority on disqualification matters within the Rajya Sabha. This makes option 2 correct.  The Governor of a state is not the final authority on disqualification of members of the State Legislature; this power rests with the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. This makes option 3 incorrect. The President of India does not have final authority on disqualification matters for Parliament; the respective Speakers of each House do. This makes option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Program           Primary Focus
1. MGNREGA                     :   Rural sanitation
2. RTE Act                      :   Right to primary education
3. Swachh Bharat Mission II    :   Water conservation
4. National Health Mission (NHM):   Healthcare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

MGNREGA's primary focus is on guaranteeing wage employment in rural areas, not sanitation.  Swachh Bharat Mission II is the government program primarily focused on rural sanitation. This makes option 1 incorrect. The RTE Act aims to provide free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14 years, making option 2 correct. The Swachh Bharat Mission II primarily focuses on sanitation and hygiene, not water conservation.  Jal Shakti Abhiyan is more directly involved in water conservation. This makes option 3 incorrect.  The National Health Mission (NHM) aims to improve healthcare access and quality across the country, making option 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment  Significant Change Related to Parliament
1. 42nd Amendment Act       :   Introduced the concept of a "Leader of the Opposition"
2. 44th Amendment Act       :   Restored the original term of the Lok Sabha
3. 87th Amendment Act       :   Did not alter seat allocation in Lok Sabha
4. 84th Amendment Act       :   Made primary education a fundamental right


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act did not introduce the concept of a Leader of the Opposition; this was a later development. This makes option 1 incorrect. The 44th Amendment Act, in response to the 42nd Amendment, restored the original five-year term for the Lok Sabha. This makes option 2 correct. The 87th Amendment Act did not make any changes to the seat allocation in the Lok Sabha. This makes option 3 correct. The 86th Amendment Act made primary education a fundamental right, not the 84th. This makes option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Action                                    Constitutional Provision
1.  Appoints Chief Minister                             : Article 164
2.  Dissolves State Legislative Assembly                : Article 174
3.  Reserves a Bill for President's Consideration      : Article 200
4.  Grants Pardons                                     : Article 161
5.  Appoints Judges to High Courts                     : Article 226

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Governor's powers are derived from several Articles of the Indian Constitution.  Article 164 deals with the appointment of the Chief Minister, stating that the Governor shall appoint a person who commands the majority in the Legislative Assembly as the Chief Minister.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Article 200 outlines the Governor's power to reserve a bill passed by the State Legislature for the consideration of the President.  Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched. Article 161 vests the Governor with the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense against a state law. Pair 4 is correctly matched.

However, the other pairs are incorrectly matched. Article 174 pertains to the power of the Governor to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, but the dissolution is not solely the Governor's prerogative; it's usually done on the advice of the Chief Minister.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.  Article 226 grants the High Court the power of judicial review, not the Governor. The Governor can consult the High Court on certain appointments but doesn't directly appoint High Court judges.  Therefore, pair 5 is incorrect.  The correct answer highlights the Governor's specific constitutional powers related to the Chief Minister's appointment, bill reservation, and pardoning powers.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Power                                     Nature of Power
1.  Appoints Advocate General                         : Discretionary
2.  Allocates Government Business                      : Discretionary
3.  Gives Assent to Bills                               : Discretionary
4.  Promulgates Ordinances                              : Bound by Council of Ministers' advice
5.  Reserves Bills for Presidential Consideration     : Discretionary


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Governor's powers are a blend of discretionary and bound powers.  The appointment of the Advocate General (pair 1), allocation of government business (pair 2), and the decision to give assent to bills (pair 3), or to reserve bills for the President's consideration (pair 5) are largely discretionary powers, though conventions and established practices often guide these decisions.  The Governor is constitutionally empowered to exercise these powers independently of the Council of Ministers.

However, the promulgation of ordinances (pair 4) is generally considered a power exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers. While the Governor technically possesses the power, the convention dictates that they act on the advice of the elected government, limiting their discretion in this particular instance. The correct option accurately reflects the discretionary nature of several key gubernatorial powers, while correctly identifying the exception regarding ordinance promulgation.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                                  Accountability
1.  Election Commission of India                       : Parliament
2.  Comptroller and Auditor General of India           : President
3.  Union Public Service Commission                    : Parliament
4.  Finance Commission                                : Parliament
5.  National Human Rights Commission                  : Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The accountability of various constitutional bodies differs. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is constitutionally independent and is not directly accountable to the Parliament or the executive.  However, it is subject to parliamentary scrutiny through questions and discussions.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is accountable to the Parliament and submits its audit reports to both Houses.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is primarily accountable to the Parliament, although its members are appointed by the President.  Pair 3 is correctly matched.  The Finance Commission is accountable to the President, not the Parliament.  Pair 4 is incorrect. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is accountable to the Parliament through its reports. Pair 5 is correctly matched. The correct answer reflects the accurate accountability mechanisms for the UPSC and NHRC, while highlighting the nuances of the ECI and CAG's independence and accountability to Parliament.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution                        Subject Matter
1. Article 356                                      :  Dissolution of Lok Sabha
2. Article 360                                      :  Financial Emergency
3. Article 352                                      :  National Emergency
4. Article 174                                      :  Dissolution of State Legislative Assembly
5. Article 200                                      :  Governor's Power to Reserve Bills


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Articles 352, 360, and 174 deal with specific constitutional provisions, correctly matched with their corresponding subject matters. Article 352 relates to the proclamation of a National Emergency, Article 360 relates to the proclamation of a Financial Emergency, and Article 174 concerns the Governor's power to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the State Legislative Assembly. Article 200 details the Governor's power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration.


However, Article 356, which deals with the President's Rule in a state, is incorrectly paired with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha (pair 1).  The President's rule is invoked in a state, not at the national level (Lok Sabha). The correct answer highlights the accurate linkage between the articles and their subjects, excluding the incorrectly paired Article 356 and its associated action.  This demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinct powers and procedures outlined in the Indian Constitution.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee                      Function
1.  Estimates Committee                       :  Examines the reports of the CAG
2.  Public Accounts Committee                 :  Examines the annual budget
3.  Committee on Public Undertakings            :  Scrutinizes the working of Public Sector Undertakings
4.  Committee on Subordinate Legislation      :  Reviews delegated legislation
5.  Committee on Government Assurances        :  Monitors government assurances


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of the functions of various parliamentary committees. The Estimates Committee examines the estimates included in the annual budget, not the reports of the CAG. The Public Accounts Committee examines the reports of the CAG. The Committee on Public Undertakings scrutinizes the working of public sector undertakings. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation reviews delegated legislation. The Committee on Government Assurances monitors government assurances made in Parliament. The correct answer demonstrates understanding of the distinct roles and responsibilities of key parliamentary committees in India's legislative process.  It highlights the specific focus of each committee, which is crucial for comprehending the system of checks and balances within the Indian Parliament.  Incorrect options demonstrate a lack of clear understanding of the specific functions of the committees.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Power of the President                     Nature of Power
1.  Appoints the Prime Minister                : Discretionary
2.  Dissolves the Lok Sabha                  : Bound by the advice of the Prime Minister
3.  Promulgates Ordinances                     : Discretionary
4.  Grants Pardons                              : Discretionary
5.  Appoints Governors                           : Discretionary


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President's powers are a mix of discretionary and bound powers, depending on the context.  The dissolution of the Lok Sabha (pair 2) is a bound power; the President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister. The promulgation of ordinances (pair 3) and the granting of pardons (pair 4) are largely discretionary powers, although conventions and established practices often guide these decisions.  The President is constitutionally empowered to exercise these powers independently in certain circumstances.  However, the appointment of the Prime Minister (pair 1) and Governors (pair 5) are also considered discretionary powers, although these are usually based on clear political conventions and the prevailing political situation.  The correct option correctly identifies the bound power of the president regarding the Lok Sabha dissolution and accurately reflects the discretionary nature of several key presidential powers.  The other options show a lack of understanding of the constitutional framework governing these powers.


**7. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment                                         Specific Provision
1.  First Amendment (1951)                                      :  Added the Ninth Schedule
2.  Seventh Amendment (1956)                                    :  Reorganized states
3.  Twenty-Fourth Amendment (1971)                               :  Restricted the power of judicial review
4.  Forty-Second Amendment (1976)                                :  Added Fundamental Duties
5.  Forty-Fourth Amendment (1978)                                :  Reinstated the right to property


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of significant constitutional amendments and their key features. The Seventh Amendment Act, 1956, led to the States Reorganisation Act, reshaping the administrative map of India.  The Twenty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1971, curtailed the scope of judicial review by placing certain laws beyond the reach of judicial scrutiny.  The Forty-Second Amendment Act, 1976, incorporated Fundamental Duties into the Constitution.  The Forty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1978, partially restored the right to property, though not as a fundamental right.


However, the First Amendment (1951) did not add the Ninth Schedule; it amended the Constitution to include restrictions on freedom of speech and expression and to validate certain land reforms. The Ninth Schedule was added later.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The correct option demonstrates a solid understanding of the historical context and impact of specific constitutional amendments in shaping the Indian political and legal landscape.  The incorrect options reveal a lack of precision in recalling the details of these amendments, which is crucial for UPSC-level understanding.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Body                                          Key Feature
1.  Lok Sabha                                             :  Permanent House
2.  Rajya Sabha                                           :  Elected by Proportional Representation
3.  State Legislative Assembly                           :  Dissolved on the advice of the Chief Minister
4.  State Legislative Council                           :  Exists in all states
5.  Parliament                                            :  Includes the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests understanding of the structure and functions of legislative bodies in India.  The Lok Sabha is not a permanent house; it is subject to dissolution.  The Rajya Sabha utilizes the system of proportional representation for election of its members.  State Legislative Assemblies are dissolved on the advice of the Chief Minister.

However, State Legislative Councils do not exist in all states; their existence is determined by state-specific legislation.  The President is not a member of Parliament but is an integral part of the Indian political system. The correct option identifies the accurate features of Rajya Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies and highlights the inaccuracies in the other options. A thorough understanding of the composition and functions of these legislative bodies is essential for a UPSC aspirant.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Provision Related To
1. Article 324                      :   Establishment of the Election Commission
2. Article 76                        :   Appointment of the Attorney General of India
3. Article 148                      :   Appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India
4. Article 266                      :   Consolidated Fund of India
5. Article 21                       :   Right to Life and Personal Liberty


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 324 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Election Commission, outlining its establishment, composition, and powers.  Article 148 pertains to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), specifying the manner of appointment, tenure, and responsibilities. Article 266 explicitly establishes the Consolidated Fund of India as the repository of all government revenues.  These three pairs are correctly matched.

Option (d) is incorrect because Article 76 concerns the Attorney General, not the Election Commission or Consolidated Fund.  Article 21 deals with the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, a fundamental right, unrelated to the other constitutional provisions mentioned. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                Function/Responsibility
1.  Lok Sabha                     :   Elects the President of India
2.  Rajya Sabha                    :   Dissolves the Lok Sabha
3.  Election Commission            :   Preparation of electoral rolls
4.  Finance Commission             :   Allocation of funds to states based on population
5.  Union Public Service Commission:   Conducts civil service examinations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission is indeed responsible for the preparation and revision of electoral rolls, a crucial function in a democratic system. This is a direct and primary responsibility of the Election Commission as mandated by the Constitution and related laws. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts the civil services examination, a key process for recruitment into various government services.  Both these pairs (3 and 5) are accurately matched.

Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete. While the Lok Sabha participates in the election of the President, it does not solely elect the President; the electoral college also includes state legislative assemblies.  Option (c) is also partially correct but incomplete, as the Finance Commission does not allocate funds based solely on population; several factors determine the allocation.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha does not dissolve the Lok Sabha; that power rests with the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Entity                 Characteristic
1. Consolidated Fund of India       :   Receives all tax revenues
2. Contingency Fund of India        :   Operates under the control of the Prime Minister
3. Public Account of India          :   Includes deposits and advances
4. Annual Financial Statement      :   Presented by the President to Parliament
5. Appropriation Bill              :   Authorizes government spending


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India is the primary repository of all government revenues, including tax collections. The Public Account of India holds various deposits and advances, distinct from the Consolidated Fund. The Appropriation Bill is a crucial legislative instrument that authorizes the government to spend the funds allocated in the budget.  These three pairs (1, 3, and 5) are accurate representations.

Option (b) is incorrect because the Contingency Fund is under the President's control, not the Prime Minister's. Option (c) is also incorrect because the Annual Financial Statement (budget) is presented by the Finance Minister to Parliament, not the President.  Option (d) combines correct and incorrect pairs, making it an inaccurate choice.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                      Key Provision/Impact
1. Government of India Act, 1935   :   Introduced Provincial Autonomy
2. 42nd Constitutional Amendment   :   Added "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble
3. 73rd Constitutional Amendment   :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
4. 52nd Constitutional Amendment   :   Introduced the Anti-Defection Law
5. Representation of the People Act, 1951 :  Established the Election Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act of 1935 is known for introducing significant provincial autonomy. The 42nd Constitutional Amendment is famous for adding "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble. The 73rd Amendment established the three-tier Panchayati Raj system. The 52nd Amendment introduced the anti-defection law. These four pairs are correctly matched.

Option (d) is incorrect because the Representation of the People Act, 1951, while crucial for elections, didn't establish the Election Commission.  The Election Commission was established by the Constitution itself (Article 324).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   High-ranking Official           Appointment Authority
1. Chief Justice of India          :   President of India
2. Comptroller and Auditor General:   Parliament of India
3. Attorney General of India       :   Prime Minister of India
4. Chairman, UPSC                :   President of India
5. Chief Election Commissioner    :   Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India.  The President also appoints the Chairman and members of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). These are direct constitutional provisions.

Option (b) is incorrect because the Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the President, not Parliament.  Option (c) is incorrect because the Attorney General is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister. Option (d) is incorrect because the Chief Election Commissioner is appointed by the President, not the Lok Sabha.  Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article             Subject Matter
1. Article 265         :   Prohibition of taxes on agricultural income
2. Article 266         :   Definition of Consolidated Fund of India
3. Article 300         :   Suits against the Union of India
4. Article 368         :   Procedure for amendment of Fundamental Rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 266 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Consolidated Fund of India and the Public Account of India.  It defines the Consolidated Fund as the fund into which all revenues received by the government are credited and from which all government expenditure is made.  Article 300 defines the legal personality of the Union of India and governs suits against the Union or State governments. Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution, which includes the process for amending Fundamental Rights.  The statement regarding Article 265 is incorrect; while Article 265 prohibits the levy of taxes except by the authority of law, it doesn't specifically mention agricultural income.  Taxes on agricultural income are typically a matter for state legislatures under the Seventh Schedule. Therefore, only pair 2 is completely accurate. The other options present misleading or partially correct information. Option (a) is incorrect because it attributes an incorrect subject matter to Article 265. Option (b) is incorrect as it includes the partially correct statement regarding Article 265. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the partially correct statement regarding Article 265.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article    Provision
1. Article 265             :   Regulation of expenditure from the Consolidated Fund
2. Article 266             :   Regulation of taxation
3. Article 300             :   Definition of the Union of India
4. Article 368             :   Amendment of the Preamble


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 300 of the Indian Constitution deals with the legal personality of the Union of India and the states. It defines the Union as a body corporate by name, and it governs suits against the Union and state governments.  Article 265 prohibits the levying of taxes except by the authority of law, not the regulation of expenditure. Article 266 deals with the Consolidated Fund and Public Account of India, not the regulation of taxation. Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution, but the Preamble is generally considered unamendable.  Therefore, only pair 3 accurately reflects the subject matter of the given articles. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they associate the articles with incorrect or partially correct provisions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Power             Description
1. Introduction of Money Bills :   Exclusive power of Rajya Sabha
2. Accountability of Ministers :   Shared power with Rajya Sabha
3. Rejection of Money Bills   :   Exclusive power of Lok Sabha
4. Creation of All-India Services:   Shared power with Rajya Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha holds the exclusive power to introduce and pass Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha can only review and make recommendations within a stipulated time frame, but it cannot reject or amend a Money Bill.  The Lok Sabha also holds the primary power of accountability over the Council of Ministers; while the Rajya Sabha can question ministers, the Lok Sabha's confidence is crucial for the government's survival.  Regarding All-India Services, both Houses of Parliament have a role in their creation. The Lok Sabha's exclusive power lies in the final decision on Money Bills. Therefore, only pair 3 accurately reflects the exclusive power of the Lok Sabha. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly attribute exclusive or shared powers to the Lok Sabha.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Consolidated Fund of India     Action
1.  Withdrawal of funds         :   Requires the President's signature only
2.  Source of funds for grants-in-aid:   Determined solely by the Rajya Sabha
3.  Expenditure charged upon it :   Not subject to parliamentary vote
4.  Defined in                    :   Article 265 of the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India requires parliamentary approval through the Appropriation Act. This is not solely the President's prerogative. The allocation of grants-in-aid to states is determined by Parliament based on recommendations from the Finance Commission.  Expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund (like salaries of the President, Supreme Court judges, etc.) is indeed not subject to the vote of Parliament because it is considered a mandatory expenditure. Finally, the Consolidated Fund of India is defined in Article 266, not Article 265.  Thus, only pair 3 accurately describes the Consolidated Fund. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the parliamentary and presidential roles in managing the Consolidated Fund.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Council Power     Duration
1.  Detaining ordinary bills   :   14 days
2.  Passing ordinary bills     :   Equal to Legislative Assembly
3.  Delaying ordinary bills    :   6 months
4.  Amending money bills      :  Unlimited


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A legislative council in India can delay an ordinary bill for a maximum of six months. This is not limited to 14 days. The legislative council and the legislative assembly have equal powers in passing ordinary bills.  The legislative council cannot amend money bills; they can only offer suggestions. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect information regarding the legislative council's power and the time limit for considering bills.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

     Scheduled Tribes Reservation    State
1. Highest number of Lok Sabha seats:   Gujarat
2. No reserved Lok Sabha seats     :    Bihar
3. Significant number of Lok Sabha seats: Madhya Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Madhya Pradesh has a significant number of reserved seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha due to its substantial tribal population. Bihar has a relatively small tribal population, resulting in a smaller number or no reserved Lok Sabha seats. Gujarat also has a number of reserved seats, but not the highest. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) misrepresent the distribution of Scheduled Tribe reserved seats in the Lok Sabha.


**7. With reference to the Union Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Circumstance          Legislative Power
1. Implementing international agreements:  Exclusive power to legislate on State List subjects
2. Consent of States        :  Power to legislate on State List subjects during an emergency
3. Proclamation of Emergency :  Power to legislate on State List subjects
4. National interest resolution (2/3 majority in Rajya Sabha): Power to legislate on State List subjects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Parliament can legislate on any subject in the State List in three main circumstances: during a national emergency, with the consent of the state legislatures, and when a resolution is passed by the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority, asserting national interest. Implementing international agreements allows the Union to legislate on subjects under the State List, provided it's necessary for the implementation of those agreements.  Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 correctly describe the circumstances under which the Union Parliament can legislate on State List subjects. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the conditions for Union Parliament's legislative power over State List subjects.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Parliamentary Committee        Type of Committee
1. Committee on Petitions          :   Ad hoc committee
2. Joint Committee on Stock Market Scam: Standing committee
3. Public Accounts Committee       :   Financial committee
4. Departmental Committees          :  Functional committee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee is a standing committee of Parliament that scrutinizes government expenditure. Departmental Committees are functional committees that oversee specific government departments. The Committee on Petitions is a standing committee, not an ad hoc committee. A Joint Committee on Stock Market Scam would be a select committee, not a standing committee. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect classifications of parliamentary committees.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Power        House
1.  Initiating Money Bill     :   Rajya Sabha
2.  Final approval of Money Bill:   Rajya Sabha
3.  Accountability of Ministers:   Rajya Sabha
4.  Introduction of Financial Bill (excluding Money Bill): Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the Lok Sabha can introduce Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha can only review and make recommendations. The Lok Sabha has the final say in the passage of Money Bills. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  Financial Bills (excluding Money Bills) can also only be introduced in the Lok Sabha; however, both houses have equal powers in their passage. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly describe the legislative powers of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha concerning financial matters.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

     Economic Survey Presentation   Timing
1.  Before the Budget            :   Every year
2.  After the Finance Bill       :   Every year
3.  After the Budget              :   Every year
4.  No relation to Budget presentation:  Every year


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Economic Survey is presented to Parliament annually, usually before the presentation of the Union Budget.  This document provides an overview of the Indian economy and informs the Budget's formulation. The timing is crucial, as it helps parliamentarians to understand the economic context before considering the Budget. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the timing of the Economic Survey's presentation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body         Function
1. Lok Sabha                 :   Nominates members to Rajya Sabha
2. Rajya Sabha                :   Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
3. Parliament                :   Determines the emoluments and service conditions of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
4. Election Commission      :   Conducts elections for Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:** The Rajya Sabha, along with the Lok Sabha, plays a crucial role in the impeachment process of the President.  Both houses must pass the resolution by a two-thirds majority for the President's removal. Thus, the Rajya Sabha does indeed initiate the process alongside Lok Sabha.

* **Pair 3:** The Parliament, being the supreme legislative body, has the power to determine the salary, allowances, and service conditions of the CAG.  This is enshrined in the Constitution, ensuring the CAG's independence from executive influence.

* **Pair 4:** The Election Commission of India is constitutionally mandated to conduct free and fair elections for all levels of government, including the Lok Sabha.

Option 1 is incorrect. The Lok Sabha does not nominate members to the Rajya Sabha.  The President nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha.

Option (a), (b) are therefore incorrect as they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Official      Action Related to CAG
1. President                  :   Appoints the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha
2. President                  :   Removes the CAG on the recommendation of Parliament
3. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) : Audits only government departments
4. Prime Minister             :  Recommends the removal of the CAG


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:** The President of India appoints the CAG, but the CAG can be removed only through a resolution passed by both houses of Parliament, presented to the President for assent.  The President acts on the recommendation of Parliament in this matter.

* **Pair 4:** While the President formally removes the CAG, the Prime Minister, as the head of the government, plays a significant role in initiating the process based on the advice of the cabinet.  The government would initiate the process of removal for the CAG.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The President does not appoint the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha itself elects its Deputy Speaker.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The CAG audits not only government departments but also public sector undertakings, autonomous bodies, and other entities as per the law.


**3. With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Feature         Description
1. Minimum Age for Membership: 21 years
2. Term Length                  : 5 years unless dissolved earlier
3. Dissolution Power           : Resides solely with the President
4. Speaker's Role              :  Always a member of the ruling party


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer because:

* **Pair 2:** The normal term of the Lok Sabha is five years, but the President can dissolve it before the completion of its term on the advice of the Prime Minister.  This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system.

* **Pair 3:** The power to dissolve the Lok Sabha rests with the President.  Although the Prime Minister advises the President on this matter, the final decision rests with the President.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  The minimum age for Lok Sabha membership is 25 years, not 21.

Pair 4 is incorrect. While the Speaker is often from the ruling party,  it's not constitutionally mandated and there have been instances of Speakers from opposition parties.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution      Characteristic
1. Contingency Fund of India :  Operated by the Prime Minister
2. Consolidated Fund of India:  All revenues of the Union Government are credited to it
3. Public Account of India    :  Includes deposits and advances of the government.
4. Reserve Bank of India      :  Maintains contingency fund


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:**  The Consolidated Fund of India is the principal financial account of the Union Government, where all revenues received are credited.

* **Pair 3:** The Public Account of India holds various government deposits, advances, and other funds that are not part of the Consolidated Fund.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Contingency Fund of India is operated by the President, not the Prime Minister.  The President can use it for unforeseen emergencies, subject to later parliamentary approval.

Pair 4 is incorrect. The Contingency Fund is not maintained by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It's a separate fund established under the Constitution.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution     Provision
1. Article 330                   : Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes in the Rajya Sabha
2. Article 332                   : Reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha
3. Article 334                   :  Expiry of reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
4. Article 331                   : Nomination of Anglo-Indian members to Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Article 334 deals with the expiration of the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies.  The reservation was initially for a period of 30 years from the commencement of the constitution and has been extended by various amendments.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Article 330 deals with reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Article 332 deals with reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the State Legislative Assemblies, not the Lok Sabha.

Pair 4 is incorrect. Article 331 deals with the nomination of Anglo-Indian members to the Rajya Sabha, not the Lok Sabha.  This provision, however, is no longer operational.


**6. With reference to the President of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Power of the President          Source
1.  Ordinance-making power       :  Article 111
2.  Power to summon Parliament : Article 85
3.  Power to dissolve Lok Sabha  :  Article 74
4.  Power to pardon               : Article 72


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:** Article 85 of the Constitution grants the President the power to summon Parliament.

* **Pair 4:** Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President with the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The ordinance-making power of the President is detailed in Article 123, not Article 111. Article 111 deals with the assent to bills passed by Parliament.

Pair 3 is incorrect.  While the President dissolves the Lok Sabha, the constitutional provision for this is not in Article 74. Article 74 deals with the Council of Ministers advising the President.  The power to dissolve the Lok Sabha is implicit within the President's executive powers.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee         Function
1. Committee on Public Undertakings : Submits reports to the CAG
2. Estimates Committee              : Examines the budget estimates
3. Public Accounts Committee       : Examines the CAG's reports on appropriation accounts
4. Committee on Subordinate Legislation : Deals with delegated legislation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:** The Estimates Committee is a crucial parliamentary committee that scrutinizes the budget estimates of government ministries and departments before they are presented to Parliament.

* **Pair 3:** The Public Accounts Committee examines the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) reports on the appropriation accounts and expenditure of government funds.

* **Pair 4:** The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines delegated legislation to ensure that the executive branch does not exceed its powers in making rules and regulations.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Committee on Public Undertakings submits its reports to Parliament, not the CAG.  The CAG's reports are, however, examined by the Public Accounts Committee.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    State                      Feature
1. Kerala                      : No reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Lok Sabha
2. Karnataka                   :  Has a Legislative Council
3. Tamil Nadu                  : No reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Lok Sabha
4. Andhra Pradesh             : No reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes in Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because Kerala and Tamil Nadu are states where no seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha. This is due to the relatively small Scheduled Tribe population in these states.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While Karnataka *does* have a Legislative Council, the question asks for features related to the reservation of seats.

Pair 4 is incorrect. Andhra Pradesh has reservations for Scheduled Castes in the Lok Sabha.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                             Provision
1. Government of India Act, 1935 : Introduced Dyarchy at the Centre
2. Indian Councils Act, 1861     : Introduced the principle of election in India
3. Indian Councils Act, 1909     : Introduced provincial autonomy
4. Government of India Act, 1919 : Introduced bicameral legislature at the Centre


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:** The Indian Councils Act of 1861, while not introducing widespread elections, did allow for the nomination of some Indian members to the legislative councils, marking a significant step towards Indian representation.

* **Pair 3:** The Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909, also known as the Indian Councils Act of 1909, introduced a limited form of provincial autonomy with the creation of separate electorates for Muslims.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Government of India Act, 1935, introduced provincial autonomy, not dyarchy at the center. Dyarchy was a feature of the 1919 Act at the provincial level.

Pair 4 is incorrect.  The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced dyarchy at the provincial level, but did not introduce a bicameral legislature at the center. The bicameral system was a feature of the 1935 Act.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body           Function
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :  Advises the President on matters related to the civil services.
2. Finance Commission             : Recommends the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the states.
3. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) :  Prepares and presents the Union Budget.
4. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):  Enforces Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because:

* **Pair 1:** The UPSC advises the President on matters relating to appointments, promotions, and other aspects of the civil services.

* **Pair 2:** The Finance Commission is a crucial constitutional body that makes recommendations to the President on the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and the states.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Union Budget is prepared and presented by the Finance Ministry, not the CAG. The CAG audits the government's accounts.

Pair 4 is incorrect. The NHRC investigates human rights violations and makes recommendations, but it does not enforce Fundamental Rights.  That responsibility lies with the courts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                Specific Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                           :   Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
2. Rajya Sabha                          :   Exclusive power to create new All-India Services
3. Lok Sabha                           :   Passes the Money Bill
4. Rajya Sabha                          :   Can authorise Parliament to legislate on State List subjects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Lok Sabha holds the primary power to initiate the impeachment process of the President, a crucial check on the executive branch. The Rajya Sabha possesses the unique constitutional power to enable Parliament to legislate on subjects within the State List, reflecting its role in safeguarding federal balance.  The Lok Sabha's exclusive power over Money Bills, financial legislation, underlines its dominance in budgetary matters.  Furthermore, the Rajya Sabha's ability to authorize Parliament to create new All-India Services highlights its role in national administration.  These powers are explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution, establishing the distinct roles and responsibilities of each house. There are no misconceptions or distractors in these pairings; each accurately reflects a specific constitutional provision.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body              Key Function/Responsibility
1. Election Commission             :   Decides disputes related to the merger/split of political parties.
2. Union Public Service Commission:   Conducts examinations for recruitment to All-India Services.
3. Central Information Commission   :   Imposes penalties under Section 20 of the RTI Act
4. Finance Commission              :   Makes recommendations on the distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and States.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the functions of the respective constitutional bodies. The Election Commission plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process, including resolving disputes among political parties.  The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is tasked with the fair and impartial recruitment of personnel to the All-India Services. The Central Information Commission (CIC) enforces the Right to Information Act, with the power to impose penalties for non-compliance. The Finance Commission, appointed by the President, is crucial in maintaining fiscal federalism by recommending the distribution of tax revenues. Each body's function is constitutionally defined or legislatively mandated, and there are no inaccuracies in the pairings. This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the Indian constitutional framework.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution     Subject Matter
1. Article 170                    :   Provides for the election of Legislative Assemblies of States.
2. Article 176                    :   Relates to the summoning and prorogation of the State Legislative Assemblies.
3. Article 21                     :    Guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.
4. Article 356                    :   Deals with the imposition of President's Rule in a State.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links an Article of the Indian Constitution with its corresponding subject matter. Article 170 explicitly deals with the composition of State Legislative Assemblies, including their elections. Article 176 outlines the procedures for summoning and proroguing these Assemblies. Article 21 is a cornerstone of the fundamental rights, guaranteeing the right to life and personal liberty. Finally, Article 356 empowers the President to impose President's Rule in a state facing constitutional breakdown.  These are fundamental aspects of the Indian constitutional scheme, and there's no ambiguity in the connections.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of key constitutional provisions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Body                 Characteristic/Power
1. Lok Sabha                         :  Dissolved by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
2. Rajya Sabha                        :   Permanent House; members have staggered terms.
3. State Legislative Assembly       :   Can be dissolved by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister.
4. State Legislative Council        :  Composition determined by the Parliament.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe characteristics or powers of the respective legislative bodies. The Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, can be dissolved by the President acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, is a permanent body with members serving staggered terms, ensuring continuity. State Legislative Assemblies, the lower houses of state legislatures, can be dissolved by the Governor based on the advice of the Chief Minister. The composition of State Legislative Councils, where they exist, is determined by Parliament.  Each point is supported by the constitutional framework, and the pairings are free of inaccuracies or misleading information. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the structure and functioning of Indian legislatures.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure/Position            Privilege/Immunity
1. President of India                 :   Cannot be arrested during his/her term of office.
2. Governor of a State                :   Emoluments cannot be diminished during his/her term.
3. Speaker of Lok Sabha               :    Cannot be removed without a motion passed by the Lok Sabha.
4. Member of Parliament              :   Freedom of speech in Parliament.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The question tests the knowledge of privileges and immunities granted to various constitutional functionaries.  All four pairs are correctly matched. The President enjoys absolute immunity from legal proceedings during their term. Governors are constitutionally protected from a reduction in their emoluments and allowances during their tenure.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha can only be removed through a specific procedure within the Lok Sabha. Members of Parliament possess freedom of speech within the confines of parliamentary proceedings.  These immunities and privileges are designed to protect the independence and effective functioning of these positions, preventing undue influence or harassment. Each point is supported by constitutional provisions and established parliamentary practices.



**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Provision Related to
1. Article 105                     :   Parliamentary privileges.
2. Article 110                     :   Definition of a Money Bill.
3. Article 171                     :   Composition of State Legislative Councils.
4. Article 352                     :   Proclamation of National Emergency.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The question assesses understanding of specific constitutional articles and their subject matter.  All four pairs are correctly matched. Article 105 outlines parliamentary privileges, ensuring the independence of the legislature. Article 110 precisely defines what constitutes a Money Bill, a crucial aspect of financial legislation. Article 171 governs the composition of State Legislative Councils,  addressing the structure of bicameral state legislatures. Article 352 grants the President the power to proclaim a National Emergency, a crucial provision during times of national crisis.  These articles are significant components of the Indian Constitution, and the connections are accurate and unambiguous.  The question demands precise factual knowledge of constitutional provisions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                     Impact on Lok Sabha/Parliament
1. 42nd Amendment Act              :   Introduction of the concept of Directive Principles of State Policy
2. 44th Amendment Act              :   Restoration of freedom of press to publish parliamentary proceedings
3. 87th Amendment Act              :  Made provisions for reservation of seats in Lok Sabha for SCs and STs
4. 84th Amendment Act              :   Introduced the Right to Education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of Constitutional Amendment Acts and their impact. While the 42nd Amendment significantly altered the Indian Constitution, including adding Directive Principles of State Policy (though not introducing the concept itself, as it already existed in a different form), and the 44th Amendment restored press freedom regarding parliamentary proceedings, the other two pairs are incorrect.  The 87th Amendment did not concern Lok Sabha seat reservations (these were already established); it dealt with OBC reservations. The 84th Amendment introduced the Right to Education, a separate piece of legislation, not directly impacting the Lok Sabha’s structure or functioning.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched.  The question requires careful analysis of the impacts of specific amendment acts.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                         Focus/Mandate
1. Business Advisory Committee      :   Scrutinizes delegated legislation
2. Committee on Subordinate Legislation:   Regulates the conduct of business in the Lok Sabha
3. Committee on Government Assurances:  Reviews government promises made in Parliament
4. Public Accounts Committee          :   Examines the expenditure of the government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The question evaluates understanding of parliamentary committees and their roles.  Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Committee on Government Assurances monitors the government's fulfillment of promises made in Parliament. The Public Accounts Committee scrutinizes government expenditure, a crucial aspect of financial oversight.  However, the other pairs are mismatched. The Business Advisory Committee schedules the business of the House, not delegated legislation. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation, as its name suggests, scrutinizes delegated legislation, not the conduct of business.  This demonstrates the need for precise knowledge of parliamentary committees and their functions.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Motion                    Purpose/Effect in Parliament
1. No-confidence motion             :   Can lead to the removal of the Council of Ministers
2. Censure motion                   :   Expresses disapproval of government policy
3. Adjournment motion                :   Used to discuss urgent matters of public importance
4. Cut motion                       :   Seeks to reduce the amount of a demand for grants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of parliamentary procedures and motions. All four pairs are correctly matched. A no-confidence motion, if successful, can force the resignation of the government. A censure motion expresses the House's disapproval of government actions. An adjournment motion allows for the discussion of urgent matters.  A cut motion seeks to reduce the allocated funds for a specific demand. These motions are integral to parliamentary democracy, providing mechanisms for accountability and debate.  The question tests understanding of parliamentary procedures and their implications.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Caste/Tribe related Act/Provision         Specific Feature
1. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989:  Appeals lie to the High Court on both facts and law.
2. Right to Education Act                             : Guarantees free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14.
3. Constitution of India (Article 335)                 : Directs that claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be considered consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration.
4. Constitution of India (Article 46)                  :  Provides for the promotion of educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other weaker sections.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual knowledge related to legislation and constitutional provisions concerning Scheduled Castes and Tribes.  All four pairs are correctly matched. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, allows appeals to the High Court on both facts and law. The Right to Education Act guarantees free and compulsory education. Article 335 of the Constitution directs that SC/ST claims are considered while maintaining administrative efficiency. Article 46 mandates the state's responsibility to promote the educational and economic interests of SCs, STs, and other weaker sections.  Understanding these provisions is crucial for analyzing social justice and affirmative action policies in India.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article Number          Provision
    1. Article 330           : Representation of Anglo-Indian community in the Lok Sabha
    2. Article 334           : Reservation of seats and special representation to cease after seventy years
    3. Article 338            : National Commission for Scheduled Castes
    4. Article 338B          : National Commission for Backward Classes
    5. Article 342A         : Socially and educationally backward classes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 330 deals with the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha, not the Anglo-Indian community.  Article 331 pertains to the representation of the Anglo-Indian community in the Lok Sabha through nomination by the President. Article 334 correctly states that the provisions for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and special representation for Anglo-Indians, were to cease after seventy years from the commencement of the Constitution.  However, this has been repeatedly extended. Article 338 accurately establishes the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Similarly, Article 338B correctly establishes the National Commission for Backward Classes. Article 342A correctly defines Socially and educationally backward classes.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment       Specific Provision
    1. 82nd Amendment Act, 2000 :  Bifurcation of the National Commission for SCs and STs into separate bodies.
    2. 89th Amendment Act, 2003 : Provisions for relaxation in qualifying marks for SCs and STs in examinations.
    3. 95th Amendment Act, 2009 : Extension of reservation for SCs and STs and special representation for Anglo-Indians until 2020.
    4. 102nd Amendment Act, 2018: Empowered the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 82nd Amendment Act of 2000 did not bifurcate the National Commission; the 89th Amendment Act of 2003 did.  The 82nd Amendment dealt with provisions for relaxation in qualifying marks and reservation in promotions for SCs and STs. The 89th Amendment Act of 2003 established separate National Commissions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  The 95th Amendment Act, 2009, correctly extended the reservation and special representation provisions. The 102nd Amendment Act, 2018, correctly empowered the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding the specific amendments and their respective provisions is crucial for accurate matching.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheduled Caste/Tribe Provision  |   Constitutional Article
    1.  Definition of Scheduled Castes  |   Article 335
    2.  Definition of Scheduled Tribes |   Article 342
    3.  National Commission for STs  |   Article 338A
    4.  Claims of SCs and STs to services and posts | Article 341

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 335 deals with the claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to services and posts, not their definitions. Article 341 defines Scheduled Castes, not Scheduled Tribes. Article 342 correctly defines Scheduled Tribes. Article 338A correctly pertains to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.  Article 338 deals with the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of constitutional articles and their specific provisions relating to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.


**4.  With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment              Specific Impact
    1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976  :   Froze seat allocation.
    2. 44th Amendment Act, 1978  :   Restored power to Lok Sabha to decide its own size.
    3. 87th Amendment Act, 2003  :   Altered seat allocation in Lok Sabha.
    4. 84th Amendment Act, 2001  : Did not affect seat allocation in Lok Sabha.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 did freeze the seat allocation in the Lok Sabha based on the 1971 census, preventing readjustment based on subsequent censuses. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restored the Lok Sabha's power to determine its own size, reversing a provision from the 42nd Amendment. The 87th Amendment Act of 2003 did *not* alter the seat allocation in the Lok Sabha.  The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 also did not affect the seat allocation in the Lok Sabha. Thus, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding the specific historical context and impact of constitutional amendments on the Lok Sabha's composition is key to answering this question correctly.


**5. With reference to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, consider the following pairs:**

    Authority                     Power/Responsibility
    1. High Court                    :  Trial of offences under the Act.
    2. State Government              :  Imposition and realization of collective fines.
    3. Central Government            :  Making rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act.
    4. Special Court                 :  Specify a Court of Session to be a Special Court.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The High Court hears appeals under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, not trials.  The District Magistrate, not the State Government, is empowered to impose and realize collective fines. The Central Government, not a Special Court, has the power to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act. The State Government, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court, can specify a Court of Session to be a Special Court.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the understanding of the different authorities and their specific roles in the implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.  A thorough knowledge of the Act's provisions is essential for correct matching.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Doctrine                     Court of Application
1. Doctrine of Severability           :   High Court of Bombay
2. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction:   Supreme Court of India
3. Doctrine of Eclipse                 :   Madras High Court
4. Doctrine of Prospective Overruling:   Kerala High Court

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction is a principle applied by the Supreme Court of India (and other higher courts) to interpret laws in a way that avoids conflict between different provisions.  If two provisions appear contradictory, the court will strive to interpret them harmoniously, giving effect to both as far as possible.  This is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation ensuring the smooth functioning of the legal system. Options 1, 3, and 4 are distractors. While the doctrines of severability, eclipse, and prospective overruling are valid legal concepts, their association with the specific High Courts listed is incorrect.  The application of these doctrines depends on the specific case and the relevant jurisdiction, not a fixed association with a particular High Court.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific application of a crucial legal principle within the Indian judicial system, highlighting their understanding of the Supreme Court's role in shaping legal interpretation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                Specific Power or Function
1. Rajya Sabha                       :   Originates Money Bills
2. Lok Sabha                          :   Impeaches the President
3. Lok Sabha                          :   Elects the Prime Minister
4. Rajya Sabha                       :   Passes the Budget

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha (House of the People) has the power to impeach the President, initiating the process and participating in the trial.  The Lok Sabha also holds the primary power to approve the budget; while the Rajya Sabha can discuss and make recommendations, the final approval rests with the Lok Sabha.  Option 1 is incorrect because Money Bills are introduced only in the Lok Sabha. Option 3 is also incorrect because the Prime Minister is not directly elected by either house but is appointed by the President based on the confidence of the Lok Sabha.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the distinct roles and responsibilities of both houses of the Indian Parliament regarding crucial processes like impeachment and budget approval, demonstrating their knowledge of the legislative framework.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Official               Action or Responsibility
1. Deputy Speaker                    :   Presides over Lok Sabha in the absence of the Speaker
2. Speaker                           :   Nominates members to the Rajya Sabha
3. Speaker                           :   Certifies a bill as a Money Bill
4. Secretary-General                 :   Maintains records of Lok Sabha proceedings


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha takes over the Speaker's responsibilities when the Speaker is absent. The Speaker has the crucial role of certifying a bill as a Money Bill, which has significant constitutional implications. The Secretary-General maintains the official records of the Lok Sabha. Option 2 is incorrect because the Speaker does not nominate members to the Rajya Sabha; this is the prerogative of the President.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the internal workings and procedures of the Lok Sabha, focusing on the specific roles of key officials within the lower house of Parliament. It assesses their understanding of the constitutional aspects related to money bills.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                 Primary Function
1. Election Commission               :   Conducts elections to state legislative assemblies
2. Union Public Service Commission   :   Conducts civil services examinations
3. Finance Commission                  :   Recommends the distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and States
4. National Human Rights Commission :   Investigates human rights violations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India conducts elections to various bodies including the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and State Legislative Assemblies. The Union Public Service Commission conducts examinations for recruitment to various civil services posts.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and the States.  The National Human Rights Commission investigates human rights violations. All the pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer. This question tests the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the roles and responsibilities of key constitutional bodies in India, encompassing election processes, civil service recruitment, fiscal federalism, and human rights protection.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Action                  Constitutional Basis
1.  Dismissal of Chief Minister     :    Article 164
2.  Reservation of a Bill              :    Article 200
3.  Dissolution of State Assembly    :    Article 174
4.  Appointment of Chief Minister  :    Article 163


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Governor's power to reserve a bill passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration is based on Article 200 of the Constitution. The Governor's role in appointing the Chief Minister is outlined in Article 163.  Options 1, 2, and 3 are distractors.  While the Governor can dismiss a Chief Minister,  Article 164 deals with the Council of Ministers, not directly the dismissal of the Chief Minister. Article 174 concerns the summoning and prorogation of the State Legislative Assembly, not its dissolution by the Governor (though the Governor can recommend dissolution). The question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the Governor's powers and their constitutional basis, demanding precise knowledge of relevant articles. This highlights their grasp of the complex relationship between the Governor and the State Legislature.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                       Impact on Lok Sabha
1. 42nd Amendment Act of 1976       :   Increased the strength to 545
2. 84th Amendment Act of 2001       :   Introduced Anti-Defection Law
3. 87th Amendment Act of 2003       :   No change in the strength
4. 44th Amendment Act of 1978       :   Reduced the strength to 525

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 87th Amendment Act of 2003 did not alter the existing strength of the Lok Sabha.  Options 1, 2, and 4 are distractors. The 42nd Amendment Act did increase the Lok Sabha's strength, but not to 545. The 84th Amendment Act pertains to the anti-defection law, not the Lok Sabha's strength. The 44th Amendment Act aimed to restore the original provisions, but the exact number it reduced the strength to is incorrect. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of constitutional amendments and their precise impact on the composition of the Lok Sabha, highlighting their understanding of legislative changes.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                  Position/Role
1.  Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar           :   First Speaker of the Lok Sabha
2.  Hukum Singh                         :   Speaker of the Third Lok Sabha
3.  G.V. Mavalankar                     :    First Law Minister of India
4.  B.D. Jatti                           :   Vice President of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar was indeed the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Hukum Singh served as the Speaker of the Third Lok Sabha. B.D. Jatti held the office of Vice President of India. Option 3 is a distractor; G.V. Mavalankar was the first Speaker, not the first Law Minister. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures in Indian parliamentary history, specifically focusing on the Speakers of the Lok Sabha and their tenures.  It also includes distractors that are plausible but inaccurate, increasing the difficulty level.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                      Article of the Constitution
1. Right to Equality                   :   Article 21
2. Right to Freedom                    :   Article 19
3. Right against Exploitation         :   Article 23
4. Right to Constitutional Remedies   :   Article 32


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Articles 19, 23, and 32 correctly correspond to the Rights to Freedom, against Exploitation, and to Constitutional Remedies, respectively. Option 1 is a distractor; Article 21 guarantees the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, not the Right to Equality (which is under Article 14). This question tests the candidate's understanding of fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution, requiring precise knowledge of the articles associated with specific rights. The inclusion of a plausible but incorrect pairing enhances the question's difficulty.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult' by incorporating closely related but incorrect options and requiring specific knowledge about the President of India's role and powers.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure/Body          Action/Power/Responsibility
1. President of India              :   Appoints the Chief Justice of India and other Supreme Court judges.
2. Parliament                     :    Impeaches the President of India.
3.  Governor                        :   Presents the Union Budget to Parliament.
4.  Union Public Service Commission:   Advises the President on appointments to the All-India Services.
5.  GST Council                    :    Consults the President on the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India and other Supreme Court judges as per Article 124 of the Constitution.  Parliament has the power to impeach the President under Article 61. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) advises the President on appointments to the All-India Services (Article 312).  Option (a) is incorrect because the Governor does not present the Union Budget to Parliament; that is the responsibility of the Finance Minister. Option (c) is also incorrect as the President does not consult with the GST Council for the appointment of the CAG; the President appoints the CAG independently. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of the GST Council with the CAG appointment.  The President's role in the GST Council is primarily related to its constitution, not the appointment of the CAG.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, demanding precise knowledge of constitutional provisions and the roles of different constitutional bodies.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body              Power/Function
1. Finance Commission              :    Recommends the President's emoluments.
2. Parliament                     :    Approves the Union Budget.
3.  Supreme Court                   :   Advises the President on matters of law and fact.
4.  Union Public Service Commission:   Appoints the President.
5.  GST Council                    :    Determines the salaries of Supreme Court judges.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Parliament's power to approve the Union Budget is a fundamental aspect of its financial control.  The Supreme Court advises the President on matters of law or fact only if he seeks such advice (Article 143). The other options are incorrect.  The Finance Commission deals with the distribution of financial resources among the Union and States, not the President's emoluments.  The President is not appointed; they are elected indirectly through an electoral college. The GST Council does not determine the salaries of Supreme Court judges; this is determined by Parliament. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring specific knowledge of the powers and functions of various constitutional bodies.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related functions.


**3. With reference to the President of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Power/Function                     Article/Act

5.  Dissolves Lok Sabha              :    Article 85


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 87 deals with the President addressing Parliament, Article 72 with the power of pardon, Article 155 with the appointment of Governors, Article 123 with the power to promulgate ordinances, and Article 85 with the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha. This question tests factual recall of constitutional provisions and the President's powers. The inclusion of all correct pairs makes it a challenging question, requiring thorough knowledge of the Constitution.  The absence of any incorrect pairings makes simple elimination impossible.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision          Subject Matter
1. Article 356                        :   Imposition of President's Rule.
2. Article 360                        :   Financial Emergency.
3. Article 352                        :   National Emergency.
4. Article 263                        :   Establishment of Inter-State Council.
5. Article 72                         :    Pardon by the President.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs accurately reflect the subject matter covered by the respective articles.  Article 356 pertains to the imposition of President's rule in states, Article 360 to financial emergency, Article 352 to national emergency, Article 263 to the establishment of the Inter-State Council, and Article 72 to the President's power of pardon.  This question demands a strong understanding of the emergency provisions and other crucial articles of the Indian Constitution. The comprehensive nature of the question, with all pairs being correct, increases its difficulty level and assesses the candidate's in-depth knowledge.


**5. With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                        Function
1. Estimates Committee              :   Examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).
2. Public Accounts Committee        :   Examines the Union Budget.
3. Committee on Public Undertakings :   Scrutinizes the working of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).
4.  Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances for Members of Parliament:  Recommends the salaries of the President and Vice-President.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Estimates Committee scrutinizes government expenditure and makes recommendations for efficiency. The Committee on Public Undertakings examines the working of PSUs.  The Public Accounts Committee examines the CAG's reports, not the Union Budget (that is the purview of the Parliament as a whole). The Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances deals with the salaries and allowances of Members of Parliament, not the President and Vice President (their salaries are determined by Parliament). This question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles and functions of parliamentary committees, requiring knowledge beyond just the names of the committees. The distractors are designed to be plausible, forcing careful consideration of each committee's specific role.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    House of Parliament               Key Feature
    1. Lok Sabha                       :   Elected by the people of India
    2. Rajya Sabha                     :   Represents States and Union Territories
    3. Parliament                     :   Consists of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
    4. Lok Sabha                       :   Has overriding power on Money Bills

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Lok Sabha, also known as the House of the People, is directly elected by the adult citizens of India, representing the people's will.  The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, represents the states and union territories, ensuring regional representation in the legislative process. The Parliament of India is a bicameral legislature, comprising the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.  Finally, the Lok Sabha possesses the final say on Money Bills, a significant aspect of India's parliamentary financial procedures.  This power reflects the Lok Sabha's role as the body directly representing the people’s interests on matters of public finance.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  A complete understanding of the structure and functioning of the Indian Parliament requires knowledge of all these elements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body              Function
    1. Election Commission          :   Conducts elections for Parliament and State Legislatures
    2. Finance Commission            :   Recommends distribution of financial resources between the Centre and States

(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the functions of the respective constitutional bodies. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is the independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Parliament and state legislatures. The Finance Commission is mandated to review the financial position of the Union and the states, recommending the distribution of tax revenues and grants. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is the supreme auditor of the Indian government, auditing the accounts of both the Union and state governments and presenting its reports to Parliament. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is an independent body established to investigate human rights violations and recommend remedial action. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and do not encompass the entirety of the correct pairings, thus demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of India's constitutional framework.

(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately describes a key aspect of the legislative process in India. Money Bills, dealing primarily with financial matters, can only originate in the Lok Sabha, reflecting its status as the House of the People and its closer connection to the populace's financial interests.  Ordinary Bills can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, showcasing the bicameral nature of the Parliament. Constitutional Amendment Bills require a special majority for passage in both houses, highlighting the importance of consensus on changes to the fundamental law of the land. Finally, Financial Bills encompass a broader spectrum of financial matters beyond just Money Bills, including taxation and government spending.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the distinct types and procedures related to bill passage in the Indian Parliament.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs present accurate correlations between articles of the Indian Constitution and their respective subject matters. Article 74 deals with the Council of Ministers, outlining its relationship with the Prime Minister and the President.  Article 75 concerns the appointment of Ministers, detailing the process by which they are chosen and their tenure. Article 352 addresses the proclamation of National Emergency, laying down the conditions under which it can be declared and its consequences. Article 163 pertains to the Council of Ministers at the state level, mirroring the structure and function of the Union Council of Ministers but operating within a state's context. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more of these crucial connections, indicating an incomplete grasp of the constitutional provisions related to the executive branch of the government.

(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of fundamental constitutional provisions.  Economic and social planning is a subject of concurrent jurisdiction, meaning both the Union and the States can legislate on it. The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, include provisions such as organizing village panchayats, reflecting a commitment to decentralized governance. Article 243A explicitly addresses the composition and powers of Gram Sabhas, the village assemblies at the grassroots level. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, showcasing a lack of thorough knowledge of the constitutional framework concerning social and economic development and local self-governance.

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of the roles and functions of key parliamentary figures. The Vice-President of India holds the ex-officio position of Rajya Sabha Chairman, presiding over its proceedings.  The Lok Sabha Speaker presides over the Lok Sabha, maintaining order and ensuring smooth functioning.  The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha acts as the Speaker's replacement when the Speaker is absent or otherwise unavailable to preside. This ensures the continuity of the House's proceedings.  Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate an incomplete understanding of the roles within the Parliament, specifically the roles of presiding officers and their relationship to the constitutional offices.  A correct answer requires complete factual knowledge.

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of significant constitutional amendments and their impact. The 73rd Amendment Act introduced the three-tier Panchayati Raj system, providing constitutional recognition to rural local governments. The 74th Amendment Act established a similar framework for urban local governments, creating municipalities with constitutional backing. The 86th Amendment Act made free and compulsory education a fundamental right for children aged 6–14.  The 101st Amendment Act introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a significant reform in India's indirect tax system. Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate an incomplete understanding of the major constitutional amendments and their related provisions, reflecting a lack of detailed knowledge of India's constitutional evolution.

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of parliamentary procedures and the different types of motions used. A no-confidence motion, a crucial tool for holding the government accountable, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, reflecting its position as the directly elected House of the People. An adjournment motion is used to halt the House's proceedings temporarily to discuss an urgent matter. A censure motion serves to express the disapproval of the House or the members of the House towards a particular government policy or action. A cut motion is employed to lower the allocation of funds for a specific government program or service. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not reflect a complete understanding of the various motions and their implications within the Indian parliamentary system.

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of the tax system in India. Income tax is a direct tax levied by the Central Government, forming a significant part of its revenue. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a dual tax, levied and collected by both the Central and State Governments, representing a major tax reform.  Before the implementation of the GST, sales tax was primarily levied by the State Governments. Excise duty is an indirect tax levied on the manufacture of goods within the country, falling under the jurisdiction of the Central Government. Options (a), (b), and (c) reflect an incomplete understanding of the Indian tax structure and the distribution of tax powers between the Central and State Governments.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the intricacies of India's tax system.

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the candidate's awareness of the constitutional status of various bodies. The National Development Council (NDC), the Planning Commission (now replaced by NITI Aayog), and the Zonal Councils are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. These were established through executive orders or statutory enactments. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), however, is a statutory body, though its specific mention in the Constitution is indirect.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, demonstrating a lack of precision in understanding which institutional bodies derive their authority from the Constitution itself.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the constitutional basis of different organizations.


**16. Consider the following pairs:**

    Power of Parliament             Description
    1. Implementing International Treaties:   Requires consent of the States concerned

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Parliament's powers.  For implementing international treaties, Parliament needs the consent of the states directly affected by the treaty's provisions.  Constitutional amendments can be initiated in either House, reflecting the bicameral nature of Parliament.  Creating new states and establishing All-India Services requires a simple majority in both Houses, indicating that while these are significant actions, they do not necessitate a supermajority. Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate an incomplete understanding of Parliament's legislative and constitutional powers.  The question demands specific knowledge of the legislative process and constitutional amendments.


**17. Consider the following pairs:**

    Authority initiating the process for determining forest rights   Legal Basis
    1. State Forest Department                             :   Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006
    2. District Collector/Deputy Commissioner             :   Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006
    3. Tahsildar/Block Development Officer/Mandal Revenue Officer: Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006
    4. Gram Sabha                                           :   Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

The question tests the candidate's understanding of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.  The Act empowers multiple authorities to initiate the process of determining forest rights. The State Forest Department, District Collector/Deputy Commissioner, and Tahsildar/Block Development Officer/Mandal Revenue Officer all play a role in the process, along with the Gram Sabha, at the village level.  The Act ensures that the process is multi-layered and involves different levels of government and local communities.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, reflecting a lack of thorough understanding of the implementation mechanisms of the Forest Rights Act.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the decentralized approach to implementing the Act.


**18. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision             Subject
    1. Preamble                          :    Economic Justice
    2. Fundamental Rights                :    Social Justice
    3. Directive Principles of State Policy:    Economic Justice
    4. Fundamental Duties                 :    Social Justice


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the location of constitutional objectives.  Economic justice is mentioned in the Preamble and elaborated upon in the Directive Principles of State Policy.  Social justice, while present in the Preamble, is prominently featured in the Directive Principles of State Policy.  Fundamental Rights primarily focus on individual freedoms and protections, not explicitly on social or economic justice, though they indirectly contribute.  Fundamental Duties, while aiming for a just society, do not directly define social or economic justice. Option (d) is incorrect as it incorrectly includes Fundamental Duties.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete. The question requires a precise understanding of the different parts of the Constitution and their respective focus.


**19. Consider the following pairs:**

    Action following Rajya Sabha amendment to a Money Bill      Legal Basis
    1. Lok Sabha proceeds, accepting or rejecting recommendations:   Article 110
    2. Lok Sabha cannot consider the Bill further                :   Article 110
    3. Lok Sabha sends the Bill back to Rajya Sabha             :   Article 110
    4. Joint sitting called by the President                     :   Article 108


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

This question focuses on the procedure for Money Bills in case of a disagreement between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.  If the Rajya Sabha amends a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha has the power to either accept or reject those amendments. The Lok Sabha is not bound by the Rajya Sabha's recommendations. The other options are incorrect. The Lok Sabha can't be forced to stop considering the bill, nor is it obligated to send it back for reconsideration. A joint sitting is only called for resolving deadlocks on ordinary bills or constitutional amendment bills, not Money Bills.  The question demands a precise understanding of the special procedure for Money Bills.


**20. Consider the following pairs:**

    Statement about the Governor     Correctness
    1. Same person cannot be Governor for two or more states simultaneously: Correct
    2. High Court judges appointed by the Governor, like Supreme Court judges by the President: Incorrect
    3. No removal procedure for Governor in the Constitution: Incorrect
    4. Chief Minister in a Union Territory with a legislature is appointed based on majority support: Correct


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of the Governor's office.  A single individual cannot simultaneously hold the governorship of multiple states. This is a constitutional limitation to prevent potential conflicts of interest and ensure effective governance.  In Union Territories with legislatures, the Chief Minister's appointment is contingent on having the support of a majority of the members of the Legislative Assembly, reflecting the principle of responsible government.  The other statements are incorrect. High Court judges are appointed by the President, not the Governor. The Constitution does have a provision for the removal of a Governor (though it's indirect, through the President).  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the constitutional provisions and the practical functioning of the Governor's office.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Constitution of India and related aspects.  Each question adheres to the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article        Subject Matter
1. Article 168                     :  Composition of the Legislative Assemblies
2. Article 170                     :  Constitution of Legislatures in States
3. Article 171                     :  Composition of the Legislative Councils
4. Article 195                     :  Salaries and allowances of members
5. Article 291                     :  Privy purse sums of Rulers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 168 of the Constitution of India deals with the constitution of legislatures in states, specifying that every state shall have a legislature which consists of the Governor and one or two Houses. Article 170 deals with the composition of the Legislative Assemblies, outlining the maximum and minimum number of members. Article 171 deals with the composition of the Legislative Councils, describing the manner of their constitution.  Article 195 relates to the salaries and allowances of members of the state legislature, not the constitution of the legislature itself. Article 291, now repealed, dealt with the privy purses of rulers, entirely unrelated to the composition or constitution of state legislatures. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                      Related Constitutional Article
1. Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878    :   Article 291
2. Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904:   Article 370
3. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947:   Article 29
4. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act, 1951: Article 253
5.  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972  :   Article 169


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The Constitution of India doesn't directly link specific articles to these Acts in a direct, one-to-one correspondence. While the Acts deal with cultural preservation and heritage,  the articles cited are not the primary constitutional basis for these laws. The Constitution provides the framework for enacting such laws under its various provisions related to cultural preservation and the power of the Parliament to make laws on matters not explicitly mentioned in the State or Union Lists (residuary powers).  The relationship is indirect and based on the general legislative powers of the Parliament, not a specific article-to-act mapping.  Therefore, none of the pairs provided are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Indian President and Governor, consider the following pairs:**

   Power                                         Applicable to
1. Promulgation of Ordinances                    :   President only
2. Assent to Bills                               :   Both President and Governor
3. Appointment of the Chief Justice of India      :   President only
4. Dissolution of the Lok Sabha                   :   President only
5. Appointment of State Ministers                 :   Governor only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India has the power to promulgate ordinances under Article 123,  and the Governor of a state under Article 213.  Both the President and the Governor can assent to bills passed by their respective legislatures. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India. The President alone can dissolve the Lok Sabha.  The Governor appoints state ministers on the advice of the Chief Minister, not independently. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect the distribution of powers between the President and Governor.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body                     Primary Function
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Conducts elections
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)   :   Audits government accounts
3. Finance Commission                         :   Reviews financial relations between the Union and States
4. Election Commission                        :   Appoints judges to High Courts
5. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):  Protects fundamental rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The UPSC is responsible for recruiting civil servants, not conducting elections. That is the function of the Election Commission. The CAG audits government accounts as per the Constitution. The Finance Commission reviews the financial relations between the Union and the States.  The High Courts' judges are appointed by the President, not the Election Commission. The NHRC plays a crucial role in protecting and promoting human rights, in line with the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the composition of the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

    House of Parliament                   Type of Representation
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Proportional Representation
2. Rajya Sabha                            :   Direct Election from States
3. Rajya Sabha                            :   Nomination by the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?


(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha employs a system of direct elections based on adult suffrage and the principle of ‘first past the post’.  The Rajya Sabha utilizes a system of indirect election by the elected members of the state legislative assemblies.  The President nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, representing specialists in various fields.  Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other options present incorrect or incomplete information about the electoral systems used by the Houses of Parliament.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                  Specific Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                            :   Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
2. Rajya Sabha                          :   Exclusive power to create new All-India Services
3. Lok Sabha                            :   Passes the Money Bill
4. Rajya Sabha                          :   Can discuss but not vote on Demands for Grants
5. Lok Sabha                            :   Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to it

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The Lok Sabha holds the sole power to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President (Article 61).  The Rajya Sabha possesses the exclusive constitutional power to authorize the Parliament to create new All-India Services (Article 312).  Money Bills can only originate in the Lok Sabha (Article 110). The Rajya Sabha can discuss the budget, including Demands for Grants, but lacks the power to vote on them; this power rests solely with the Lok Sabha.  Finally, the Council of Ministers is constitutionally accountable to the Lok Sabha, meaning it must maintain the confidence of the Lower House to remain in power.  A no-confidence motion can only be moved in the Lok Sabha. This underlines the Lok Sabha's dominant position in the Indian parliamentary system concerning the executive.  The other options are incorrect as they omit one or more of these crucial, accurately matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                Specific Function/Power
1. Election Commission of India       :   Certifies the net proceeds of taxes
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):   Conducts elections for President
3. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC): Appoints judges to the Supreme Court
4. Finance Commission                  :   Recommends the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Finance Commission's primary responsibility is to recommend the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and State governments, a crucial aspect of India's fiscal federalism. The other pairs are incorrect. The Election Commission conducts elections but not for the President (that's an electoral college). The CAG audits government accounts, not taxes.  The President appoints Supreme Court judges, not the UPSC, although the UPSC plays a role in the selection process.  Therefore, understanding the specific mandates of each constitutional body is vital for accurate matching. The other options are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Action                  House of Parliament where it originates
1. Money Bill                          :   Rajya Sabha
2. No-confidence motion                :   Rajya Sabha
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill       :   Lok Sabha
4. Resolution on National Emergency   :   Lok Sabha
5. Censure Motion                      :   Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Constitutional amendment bills can be introduced in either house, but the Lok Sabha plays a more significant role in their passage.  A resolution to end a national emergency must originate in the Lok Sabha.  A censure motion, expressing disapproval of the government, can be initiated in either house, though the Lok Sabha holds greater weight.  Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect because Money Bills are introduced only in the Lok Sabha, and no-confidence motions can only be initiated in the Lok Sabha.  Understanding the unique procedural aspects of each legislative action and the differing roles of the two houses is crucial for accurate matching.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee              Primary Function
1. Estimates Committee                 :   Examines the annual budget before its presentation to Parliament
2. Public Accounts Committee            :   Audits the accounts of the government
3. Committee on Public Undertakings     :   Oversees the performance of Public Sector Undertakings
4. Committee on Subordinate Legislation:   Scrutinizes the exercise of delegated legislative powers by the executive

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Public Accounts Committee examines the CAG's report on government expenditure. The Committee on Public Undertakings scrutinizes the functioning of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). The Committee on Subordinate Legislation ensures that the executive branch properly exercises its delegated legislative powers.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Estimates Committee examines government expenditure *after* the budget's presentation to Parliament, focusing on efficiency and economy.  A thorough understanding of the distinct responsibilities of these parliamentary committees is key to accurate matching.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution           Subject Matter
1. Article 105                           :   Privileges and immunities of Members of Parliament
2. Article 356                           :   President's Rule
3. Article 74                            :   Council of Ministers
4. Article 61                            :   Impeachment of the President
5. Article 360                           :   Financial Emergency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately link the constitutional articles with their respective subjects.  Article 105 clearly defines parliamentary privileges. Article 356 deals with the President's power to impose President's Rule in a state.  Article 74 concerns the Council of Ministers and its relationship with the President. Article 61 outlines the process for impeaching the President. Lastly, Article 360 specifies the provisions related to a Financial Emergency.  A strong grasp of the Indian Constitution's key articles and their functions is crucial for accurate matching.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.

Here are 15 UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Position             Person
1. Finance Minister, Pakistan     :     Liaqat Ali Khan
2. Finance Minister, India         :     Jawaharlal Nehru
3. Finance Minister, UK            :     George Osborne
4. Finance Minister, Canada        :     Bill Morneau

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Liaquat Ali Khan served as the first finance minister of Pakistan.  The other options present plausible distractors; Jawaharlal Nehru held the position of Prime Minister of India, not Finance Minister (although he was heavily involved in economic policy).  Similarly, George Osborne and Bill Morneau were Finance Ministers of the UK and Canada respectively, but this is not the focus of the question.  The question is designed to test knowledge of specific individuals and their governmental roles, emphasizing precise factual recall. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar roles and individuals from different countries.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Official           Action
1. Finance Minister              :     Presents the Union Budget
2. Chief Election Commissioner :     Appoints the Governor
3. Speaker of Lok Sabha         :     Presides over the Rajya Sabha
4. President of India           :     Dissolves the Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Minister is responsible for presenting the Union Budget to Parliament. The President of India has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister. Options 2 and 3 are incorrect. The Chief Election Commissioner doesn't appoint Governors; that power rests with the President. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  This question tests factual knowledge about the roles and responsibilities of key government officials within the Indian political system.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                  Characteristic
1.  Finance Commission            :     Reports to the Prime Minister
2.  FSDC                          :     Headed by the Finance Minister
3.  Committee on Official Language:     Reviews usage of English
4.  Estimates Committee           :     Reviews budget after approval by Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) is headed by the Finance Minister. The Estimates Committee reviews the budget estimates before they are approved by Parliament. The Finance Commission reports to the President, not the Prime Minister.  The Committee on Official Language primarily focuses on Hindi, not English. This question tests understanding of the functions and structures of various Indian governmental organizations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body              Action Related to a Committee
1. Parliament                   :     Creates Sub-Committees
2. Rajya Sabha                  :     Submits a report to the President
3. Lok Sabha                    :     Reviews reports of the CAG
4. Council of Ministers         :     Consults eminent persons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Parliament has the power to create committees and sub-committees.  A committee within Parliament can submit reports to the President. The Council of Ministers might consult eminent persons for advice on various policy matters, but this is a broad statement. The Public Accounts Committee, not necessarily a general committee, reviews reports of the CAG. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the relationship between different branches of government and their interaction with parliamentary committees.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Committee Action            Location
1. Investigated events         :     Delhi
2. Submitted a report          :     Amritsar
3. Studied elections           :     Mumbai
4. Met in                       :     Kolkata


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are definitively matched based on the provided information. The target content mentions a committee meeting in Delhi and investigating events in Amritsar, but does not specify that these were the only locations of activity. Studying elections and the submission of reports could have taken place in various locations. The question tests the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information and avoid making unwarranted assumptions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body              Type of Member
1. Committee                    :     Ex-officio member
2. Rajya Sabha                  :     Nominated member
3. Lok Sabha                    :     Elected member
4. Council of Ministers         :     Constitutional expert


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Committees can include ex-officio members.  The Rajya Sabha includes nominated members. The Lok Sabha comprises elected members. The Council of Ministers may include individuals with expertise in constitutional matters, but this is not a defining characteristic of all members. This question assesses understanding of the composition of different government bodies.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body          Specific Power
1. Lok Sabha                  :     Reviews Bills
2. Rajya Sabha                 :     Approves Proclamation of Emergency
3. Parliament                  :     Fixes the date of election for the Speaker of Lok Sabha
4. Council of Ministers       :     Presents a Bill to Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lok Sabha reviews bills, Rajya Sabha approves emergency proclamations, Parliament sets the election date for the Lok Sabha Speaker, and the Council of Ministers proposes and presents bills to Parliament. This question tests understanding of the powers and functions of the different branches of the Indian government.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Motion              House Where it Can be Moved
1. Censure Motion             :     Rajya Sabha only
2. No-Confidence Motion      :     Lok Sabha only

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

No-confidence motions are specific to the Lok Sabha as it reflects the confidence of the lower house in the executive branch.  Money Bills originate in the Lok Sabha. Adjournment motions can be moved in both houses of Parliament. Censure motions can be moved in both houses, not just the Rajya Sabha.  This question tests understanding of the parliamentary procedures in India.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas, and the Sixth Schedule addresses the administration of tribal areas in the specified states. The Eighth Schedule lists the officially recognized languages of India. The Seventh Schedule outlines the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States, not seat allocation in the Lok Sabha. This question tests knowledge of specific provisions within the Indian Constitution.

(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the members of the Union Public Service Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor General. The President also appoints the members of the Finance Commission.  The Election Commission of India is not appointed by Parliament; it's an independent body, although Parliament plays a role in its oversight. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the appointment process for key constitutional bodies.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bill             House of Origin
1. Money Bill               :     Rajya Sabha

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Financial bills can originate in either house of Parliament.  Constitutional amendment bills can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. Money Bills originate in the Lok Sabha. Private members' bills can be introduced in either house. This question tests the understanding of the different types of bills and their procedural aspects within the Indian Parliament.

(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act 1919 introduced dyarchy at the provincial level, and the Government of India Act 1935 established a federal structure with provisions for provincial autonomy. The Indian Independence Act of 1947 paved the way for India's independence and the creation of the Constituent Assembly.  The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms (1918) are synonymous with the Government of India Act 1919. This question tests knowledge of important historical acts concerning Indian governance.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Balwantray Mehta Committee recommended a two-tier Panchayati Raj system. The GVK Rao Committee focused on strengthening the Gram Sabha. The L.M. Singhvi Committee addressed the overall strengthening of Panchayati Raj institutions.  The Ashok Mehta Committee suggested a three-tier system, a key difference making it a distractor.  This question tests knowledge of committees related to Panchayati Raj.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                      Provision
1. 42nd Amendment Act (1976)      :    Added Fundamental Duties

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The 73rd and 74th Amendments established Panchayati Raj institutions and Municipalities respectively.  The 44th Amendment aimed to restore the balance of power between the Parliament and the executive, not curtail the President's power. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of important constitutional amendments.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                 Right/Principle
1. Article 21                               :    Right to Education

3. Article 324                               :    Election Commission
4. Article 356                               :    President's Rule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 23 deals with the Right against Exploitation (prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour). Article 324 establishes the Election Commission of India. Article 356 relates to the President's Rule.  While the Right to Education is a fundamental right, it is not explicitly mentioned in Article 21.  Article 21 is the Right to Life and Personal Liberty and has been interpreted to include this right. The question tests knowledge of specific articles in the Indian Constitution and their associated rights and provisions.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Official             Responsibility/Power
1. Speaker                         :   Certifies a Bill as a Money Bill
2. Deputy Speaker                  :   Presides over a Joint Sitting of Parliament in the Speaker's absence
3. Panel of Chairpersons          :   Can preside when the Speaker's office is vacant
4. Speaker Pro Tem                  :   Administers the oath to newly elected MPs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the sole authority to determine whether a bill is a Money Bill or not. This power is explicitly granted by the Constitution and is crucial for maintaining the balance of power between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in financial matters.  Option 1 correctly reflects this crucial function of the Speaker.  The Deputy Speaker assumes the Speaker's responsibilities, including presiding over joint sittings, when the Speaker is absent. Option 2 accurately describes this role. The Speaker Pro Tem, appointed by the President, presides over the first sitting of a newly elected Lok Sabha, primarily administering oaths to new members and facilitating the election of the new Speaker. Option 4 correctly reflects this temporary but vital role.  Option 3 is incorrect because the Panel of Chairpersons cannot preside over the House when the Speaker's office is vacant; in such a scenario, the President appoints a member to perform the Speaker's duties until a new Speaker is elected.  This highlights a critical distinction in the powers and functions of different Lok Sabha officials.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Action              Result/Consequence
1.  Passage of a No-Confidence Motion:   Leads to the resignation of the Prime Minister
2.  Defeat of a Money Bill         :   Dissolution of the Lok Sabha
3.  Approval of a Proclamation of Emergency:  Extension of the Lok Sabha's term
4. Rejection of Budget Demands   :  Government Resignation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

A successful no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha signifies that the lower house of Parliament has withdrawn its confidence in the Council of Ministers, conventionally leading to the resignation of the Prime Minister and the government.  Option 1 accurately reflects this.  The approval of a proclamation of emergency by the Lok Sabha allows for the extension of the Lok Sabha's term beyond its normal five-year limit. This is a constitutional provision designed to handle exceptional circumstances. Option 3 is correctly matched.  The rejection of budget demands by the Lok Sabha indicates a lack of confidence in the government's financial policies, which can lead to its resignation. Option 4 is also correctly matched. Option 2 is incorrect; the defeat of a Money Bill does not automatically lead to the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. While it can trigger political instability, the Lok Sabha's dissolution is at the discretion of the President, usually on the advice of the Prime Minister.  The other options accurately depict the consequences of specific actions within the Lok Sabha.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Committee             Composition/Function
1. Public Accounts Committee       :   Has members from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
2. Estimates Committee             :   Examines the estimates included in the Annual Financial Statement
3. Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions:   Headed by the Deputy Speaker

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a parliamentary committee with members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, playing a crucial role in scrutinizing government expenditure.  Option 1 accurately represents its composition. The Estimates Committee, composed solely of Lok Sabha members, examines the annual budget's estimates, ensuring efficient resource allocation and accountability. Option 2 is also correct. Option 3 is incorrect; while the Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions is indeed important, it's not headed by the Deputy Speaker. The Chairman of this committee is appointed by the Speaker.  Understanding the composition and functions of these Lok Sabha committees is vital for comprehending the legislative process and mechanisms of oversight.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lok Sabha Procedure           Description
1. Question Hour                  :   Allows members to seek clarifications on government policies
2. Adjournment Motion             :   Seeks immediate suspension of parliamentary proceedings
3. Cut Motion                     :   Reduces the amount of a demand for grants
4. No-Confidence Motion          :   Expresses lack of confidence in the government

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Question Hour provides a platform for members to question the government on various issues, fostering transparency and accountability. Option 1 is correctly matched. An Adjournment Motion is a procedural device to halt parliamentary proceedings temporarily to address urgent matters. Option 2 is accurately described. A Cut Motion is a budgetary tool used to reduce the amount allocated for a specific demand, thereby influencing government spending. Option 3 is correctly matched. A No-Confidence Motion, a powerful tool in parliamentary democracy, is used to express a lack of confidence in the government, potentially leading to its downfall. Option 4 is also correctly matched. All the options correctly describe various parliamentary procedures within the Lok Sabha, demonstrating a clear understanding of legislative processes.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Lok Sabha:**

   Statement                                    True/False
1. The Lok Sabha elects its own Speaker.        :   True
2. The President appoints the Deputy Speaker.   :   False
3. The Lok Sabha can remove the Speaker.       :   True

Which of the statements given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha, as per the Indian Constitution, elects its Speaker from amongst its members. This ensures the House's autonomy in choosing its presiding officer. Statement 1 is thus correctly matched. The Lok Sabha also possesses the power to remove its Speaker through a resolution passed by a majority of its members. This mechanism ensures accountability and allows the House to address any concerns regarding the Speaker's conduct or performance. Statement 3 is correctly matched. Statement 2 is incorrect; the President does *not* appoint the Deputy Speaker; the Lok Sabha elects its Deputy Speaker, similar to the Speaker’s election.  The accurate matching of these statements demonstrates a clear understanding of the Lok Sabha's internal processes and the relationship between the House and its presiding officers.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament              Characteristic Feature
1. Lok Sabha                       :   Permanent House
2. Rajya Sabha                     :   Introduces Money Bills
3. Lok Sabha                       :   Can remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion
4. Rajya Sabha                     :   Represents States and Union Territories

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament, holds the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion. This underlines the Lok Sabha's crucial role in maintaining the government's accountability to the people's representatives. Statement 3 is correctly matched. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, represents the States and Union Territories, ensuring their voices are heard in the legislative process. Statement 4 is correctly matched. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Lok Sabha is *not* a permanent house. It has a five-year term, subject to dissolution. Statement 2 is also incorrect; only the Lok Sabha can introduce Money Bills; the Rajya Sabha can only review and recommend amendments but cannot reject or amend them. The correct matching of statements 3 and 4 indicates a sound understanding of the distinct roles and powers of the two houses of Parliament.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body         Primary Function related to Parliament
1. Election Commission of India :   Conducts elections for the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) :   Presides over joint sittings of Parliament
3. President                       :   Appoints the Speaker Pro Tem of the Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is constitutionally mandated to conduct free and fair elections for both houses of Parliament.  This is a fundamental role in upholding democratic principles. Option 1 accurately reflects this. The President of India, as the head of state, appoints the Speaker Pro Tem of the Lok Sabha to preside over the first sitting of the newly elected Lok Sabha. This is a crucial constitutional role in facilitating the smooth transition of power. Option 3 is correctly matched. Option 2 is incorrect; the CAG does not preside over joint sittings of Parliament. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over such sittings.  The correct identification of the roles of the ECI and the President demonstrates an understanding of their respective constitutional powers.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Parliamentary Committee       Characteristic
1. Public Accounts Committee      :   Examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)
2. Estimates Committee            :   Consists entirely of Rajya Sabha members
3. Business Advisory Committee   :   Decides the agenda and allocation of time for parliamentary business

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) plays a vital role in examining the CAG's reports on government expenditure, thereby ensuring financial accountability.  Option 1 accurately describes its function. The Business Advisory Committee (BAC) is responsible for determining the agenda and time allocation for parliamentary debates and discussions, ensuring efficient utilization of parliamentary time. Option 3 is correctly matched. Option 2 is incorrect. The Estimates Committee consists entirely of Lok Sabha members, not Rajya Sabha members.  The correct matching of options 1 and 3 demonstrates a good understanding of the roles of these key parliamentary committees.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                      House of Origin
1. Money Bill                       :   Rajya Sabha
2. Financial Bill (not solely under Article 110):  Lok Sabha
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill :   Either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only the Lok Sabha can originate Money Bills, a key aspect of India's parliamentary system designed to grant the lower house greater control over financial matters. Option 1 is incorrect. Financial Bills (those not exclusively covered by Article 110's definition of Money Bills) can originate in either house of Parliament. Option 2 is correctly matched.  Constitutional Amendment Bills can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, reflecting the shared responsibility for constitutional changes. Option 3 is correctly matched. The correct identification of the houses of origin for these bill types demonstrates an understanding of the nuanced legislative procedures and the balance of power between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Lok Sabha Member's Privilege      Description
1. Freedom of Speech                 :   Applies only to statements made outside the House
2. Immunity from Arrest               :   Applies to both civil and criminal cases during sessions
3. Right to Information on Arrest    :   Applies only to arrests made within the House premises

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Freedom of speech for Lok Sabha members applies only to statements made *within* the House and its committees, providing them protection against legal action for their parliamentary utterances. Statement 1 is incorrect. Immunity from arrest for Lok Sabha members applies primarily to civil cases during sessions, not criminal cases. Statement 2 is incorrect. The right to information on the arrest, detention, etc., of a Lok Sabha member applies regardless of the location of the arrest. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, highlighting potential misconceptions about the scope and limitations of parliamentary privileges.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Primary Function
1.  Union Public Service Commission       :   Conducts examinations for recruitment to All India Services
2.  State Public Service Commission       :   Advises the State Government on matters relating to appointments and promotions
3.  Central Vigilance Commission         :   Investigates allegations of corruption against Central Government employees
4.  Election Commission of India          :   Conducts elections to Parliament and State Legislatures
5.  Finance Commission                    :   Recommends the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and the States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs listed are correctly matched.  The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is responsible for conducting civil services examinations and recruiting candidates for All India Services. State Public Service Commissions (SPSCs) perform a similar function at the state level, advising their respective state governments on appointments and promotions. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is an independent body tasked with investigating corruption within the central government. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is the independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections. Finally, the Finance Commission is a constitutional body that recommends the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and the States, ensuring fiscal federalism.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                         Key Provision
1.  42nd Amendment Act, 1976           :   Added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution
2.  44th Amendment Act, 1978           :   Removed the right to property as a Fundamental Right
3.  73rd Amendment Act, 1992           :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
4.  74th Amendment Act, 1992           :   Established Municipalities
5.  52nd Amendment Act, 1985           :   Added the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key provision introduced by the respective Constitutional Amendment Act. The 42nd Amendment significantly altered the Indian Constitution by adding Fundamental Duties and making several changes to the Directive Principles of State Policy. The 44th Amendment removed the right to property as a fundamental right, shifting it to a legal right. The 73rd and 74th Amendments were landmark legislation that provided constitutional status to Panchayati Raj Institutions and Municipalities respectively, leading to significant decentralization of power. The 52nd Amendment introduced the Tenth Schedule, dealing with anti-defection laws to prevent political instability caused by shifting party loyalties.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Body                       Power/Function
1.  Lok Sabha                              :   Initiates Money Bills
2.  Rajya Sabha                           :   Can delay but not reject Money Bills
3.  State Legislative Assembly             :   Elects the Chief Minister
4.  State Legislative Council             :   Can introduce Money Bills
5.  Parliament                              :   Amends the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament, holds the primary power to initiate Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha can scrutinize and make recommendations on Money Bills but cannot reject them.  State Legislative Assemblies elect their respective Chief Ministers. Parliament, comprising both Houses, possesses the power to amend the Constitution. However, State Legislative Councils do *not* have the power to introduce Money Bills; only State Legislative Assemblies can do so.  Therefore, option (d) is incorrect because of the inclusion of the incorrect pairing involving the State Legislative Council.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Court                                    Jurisdiction
1.  Supreme Court of India                :   Appeals from High Courts
2.  High Courts                            :   Original jurisdiction in certain cases
3.  District Courts                        :   Appellate jurisdiction over subordinate courts
4.  Subordinate Courts                    :   Original jurisdiction in most civil and criminal cases
5.  Central Administrative Tribunal       :   Disputes related to Central Government employees


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court of India has appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts, hearing appeals on various matters. High Courts have original jurisdiction in specific cases, such as disputes involving the fundamental rights of citizens, and also have appellate jurisdiction over lower courts. District Courts typically have appellate jurisdiction over subordinate courts within their district. Subordinate Courts deal with the majority of civil and criminal cases at the initial level. Finally, the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) adjudicates disputes concerning central government employees.  All the pairs accurately reflect the respective jurisdictions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bill                              Special Feature
1. Money Bill                               :   Can only be introduced in Lok Sabha
2. Ordinary Bill                             :   Requires passage by both Houses of Parliament
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill           :   Requires a special majority in both Houses
4. Private Member's Bill                    :   Introduced by a Member of Parliament, not a Minister
5. Finance Bill                              :   Deals with taxation and other financial matters


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs correctly describe the special features of each type of bill in the Indian Parliament.  A Money Bill, concerning primarily financial matters, can only originate in the Lok Sabha. Ordinary Bills require the approval of both Houses to become law. Constitutional Amendment Bills necessitate a special majority for passage. Private Member's Bills are those introduced by individual MPs, not members of the government. Finance Bills, encompassing taxation and other financial aspects, are a crucial part of the budget process.  The information presented in all five pairs is accurate and well-established in Indian parliamentary procedure.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                     Characteristic
1. Estimates Committee                         :   Examines the annual budget and suggests improvements
2. Public Accounts Committee                  :   Audits government spending after it has occurred
3. Committee on Public Undertakings             :   Oversees the performance of state-owned enterprises
4. Departmentally Related Standing Committee (DRSC) :   Scrutinizes the work of specific government departments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Estimates Committee is a crucial parliamentary committee that scrutinizes the government's annual budget before it is approved. Its role is to identify potential areas for improvement in terms of efficiency and economy in government spending. The Public Accounts Committee examines the government's accounts after the money has been spent, ensuring that funds were utilized as intended and in accordance with established procedures. The Committee on Public Undertakings monitors the performance of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) or state-owned enterprises, assessing their efficiency, profitability, and overall contribution to the economy.  Finally, the Departmentally Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) are parliamentary committees that oversee the activities of specific government ministries or departments, providing a mechanism for parliamentary oversight and accountability.  Each committee plays a distinct but equally important role in ensuring governmental transparency and effective use of public resources.  There are no inaccuracies in the provided pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment                  Primary Impact
1. 52nd Amendment                          :   Strengthened the powers of the Election Commission
2. 61st Amendment                          :   Lowered the voting age to 18
3. 73rd Amendment                          :   Empowered Panchayati Raj institutions
4. 42nd Amendment                          :   Added "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the 52nd Amendment did introduce anti-defection laws, its primary impact wasn't on strengthening the Election Commission's powers directly. The 61st and 73rd Amendments are correctly paired with their respective impacts: lowering the voting age and empowering Panchayats.  The 42nd Amendment is accurately linked to its amendment of the Preamble. Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly include the 52nd Amendment's impact.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Grant                           Description
1. Vote on Account                         :   Granted to meet expenditures for a part of the financial year
2. Supplementary Grant                    :   Granted to meet unforeseen expenditure
3. Excess Grant                            :   Granted after the financial year to cover excess expenditure
4. Token Grant                            :   Granted for a new service when the exact amount is unknown

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the characteristics of different types of grants in the Indian budgetary system. A Vote on Account is a temporary grant provided to the government to meet its expenses for a portion of the financial year, pending the passage of the full budget.  Supplementary Grants are allocated to meet unforeseen or additional expenditures that were not included in the original budget.  Excess Grants are approved after the end of the financial year to cover expenses that exceeded the amounts initially authorized.  Finally, Token Grants are used when the government needs to initiate a new service or program but the precise amount of funding required is still uncertain.  These grants allow for the commencement of the program while more detailed cost estimates are developed.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Schedule in the Indian Constitution        Subject Matter
1. Second Schedule                          :   Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha
2. Fifth Schedule                            :   Administration of Scheduled Areas
3. Sixth Schedule                            :   Administration of tribal areas in certain states
4. Twelfth Schedule                         :   Municipal governance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Second Schedule deals with matters such as salaries and allowances of the President, Governors, Judges and other dignitaries, not the allocation of Rajya Sabha seats.  Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Fifth Schedule details the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes. The Sixth Schedule outlines the governance of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  The Twelfth Schedule lists the functions of municipalities. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution       Provision
1. Article 169                             :   Creation or abolition of Legislative Councils
2. Article 171                             :   Composition of Legislative Councils
3. Article 356                             :   President's Rule in States
4. Article 280                             :   Establishment of Finance Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Articles 169 and 171 correctly relate to the creation/abolition and composition of Legislative Councils, respectively. Article 280 accurately refers to the establishment of the Finance Commission.  However, Article 356 concerns President's Rule, not the composition or powers of the Legislative Councils.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee                 Primary Function
1. Public Accounts Committee               :   Examines the CAG's report on appropriation accounts
2. Committee on Public Undertakings         :   Examines reports and accounts of public undertakings
3. Estimates Committee                     :   Examines the government's budget estimates
4. Committee on Subordinate Legislation  :   Scrutinizes delegated legislation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe the primary functions of the respective parliamentary committees. The Public Accounts Committee scrutinizes the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) report on how the government has spent the money allocated by Parliament.  The Committee on Public Undertakings assesses the performance and financial health of state-owned enterprises. The Estimates Committee reviews the government's budget proposals before funds are allocated, suggesting improvements in efficiency and economy.  Finally, the Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines the rules and regulations made by the executive branch under powers delegated by Parliament.  Therefore, all four are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                              Requirement for Introduction
1. Money Bill                               :   Prior recommendation of the President
2. Constitutional Amendment Bill          :   Special majority in both Houses
3. Ordinary Bill                             :   Simple majority in both Houses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While a Money Bill does need to be introduced in the Lok Sabha first, it doesn't require *prior* recommendation of the President. It needs the Lok Sabha's approval, making the first pair incorrect. The remaining two pairs are correctly matched. A Constitutional Amendment Bill requires a special majority (two-thirds majority of the members present and voting) in both Houses, and an Ordinary Bill needs a simple majority. Thus, only the second and third pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Power                        Nature of Power
1. Appointing the Chief Minister           :   Discretionary power
2. Dissolving the State Legislative Assembly:   Constitutional power
3. Assenting to Bills                        :   Constitutional power, with some discretion
4. Issuing Ordinances                       :   Constitutional power, subject to limitations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the Governor does appoint the Chief Minister, it's typically based on the majority party's recommendation, making the level of discretion limited.  The powers to dissolve the assembly, assent to bills, and issue ordinances are all explicitly given to the Governor by the Constitution, but within certain frameworks.  Therefore, only the last three pairs are correctly matched.  The first pair is not entirely accurate due to the contextual limitations on the Governor's discretion.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Term                            Meaning
1. Charged Expenditure                     :   Expenditure not subject to vote of Parliament
2. Vote on Account                          :   Provisional grant for part of the financial year
3. Supplementary Grant                     :   Additional grant for unforeseen expenses
4. Contingency Fund                        :   For unforeseen emergencies, not requiring parliamentary approval

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately define the given financial terms within the Indian budgetary framework. Charged expenditure is not subject to the vote of Parliament as it is mandatory and constitutionally mandated. A Vote on Account is a temporary grant. Supplementary grants address unforeseen needs. The Contingency Fund is a reserve for emergencies without prior parliamentary authorization.  Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                                 Key Function
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Conducts civil services examinations
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)   :   Audits government accounts
3. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)      :   Investigates corruption cases
4. NITI Aayog                               :   Formulates national development plans

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the primary functions of the listed institutions. The UPSC conducts the civil services examination for recruitment to various government services. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State governments. The CVC investigates allegations of corruption within the government. NITI Aayog is responsible for formulating national development plans and strategies.  Thus, all four are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                  Specific Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Sole power to initiate impeachment of the President
2. Rajya Sabha                            :   Exclusive power to create new All-India Services
3. Lok Sabha                             :   Power to approve the Union Budget
4. Rajya Sabha                            :   Power to amend Money Bills
5. Lok Sabha                             :   Power to pass a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha holds the sole power to initiate the impeachment process of the President, as per the Indian Constitution.  The Rajya Sabha, while it can participate in the process, cannot initiate it.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Article 312 of the Constitution grants the Rajya Sabha the exclusive power to authorise Parliament to create new All-India Services.  This is a crucial federal aspect, reflecting the Rajya Sabha's role in representing states' interests. Hence, pair 2 is correct.  The Lok Sabha plays a pivotal role in the budgetary process; it approves the Union Budget, including Demands for Grants.  The Rajya Sabha can only discuss the budget, not vote on it. Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched.  Pair 4 is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha cannot amend Money Bills; it can only recommend changes, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept. Pair 5 is incorrect; only the Lok Sabha can pass a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers, leading to the government's resignation. This highlights the Lok Sabha's supreme position in matters of executive accountability.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Specific Function
1. Finance Commission                    :   Recommends the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and States
2. Election Commission                    :   Conducts elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies
3. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) :   Audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments
4. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):   Appoints judges of the Supreme Court
5. National Human Rights Commission     :   Investigates human rights violations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission, as per its constitutional mandate, recommends the principles governing the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the States.  This is a critical aspect of India's fiscal federalism. Hence, pair 1 is correctly matched. The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections to the Lok Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, and other bodies.  Therefore, pair 2 is correct. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments to ensure financial accountability and transparency. This is a vital function in maintaining good governance.  Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched. Pair 4 is incorrect; the appointment of Supreme Court judges is the prerogative of the President, not the UPSC.  The UPSC conducts civil services examinations and advises on appointments to various government posts. Pair 5 is correct in its broad description but is not a constitutional body in the same sense as the others listed. It's a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                           Key Provision Related to Parliament
1. 42nd Amendment Act                    :   Added "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble
2. 44th Amendment Act                    :   Restored freedom of the press to publish true reports of parliamentary proceedings
3. 87th Amendment Act                    :   Did not alter the seat allocation in the Lok Sabha
4. 73rd Amendment Act                    :   Provided for the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas
5. 42nd Amendment Act                    :   Made the Prime Minister's advice binding on the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Preamble by adding the words "socialist" and "secular," reflecting a shift in the nation's ideological orientation. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978, responding to concerns about press freedom, restored the right of the press to publish true reports of parliamentary proceedings without prior permission, except in cases of secret sittings. Hence, pair 2 is correct. The 87th Amendment Act, 2003, dealt with the reservation of seats for SCs and STs and did not change the Lok Sabha's seat allocation. Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched. Pair 4 is incorrect; the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas was brought about by the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not a constitutional amendment. Pair 5 is partially correct; the 42nd Amendment did significantly strengthen the position of the Prime Minister, but the statement is an oversimplification of the complex relationship between the President and the Prime Minister.  The 42nd Amendment did not explicitly make the Prime Minister's advice *binding* on the President in all matters, but rather significantly curtailed the President's powers.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution          Subject Matter
1. Article 3                                 :   Formation of new states and alteration of boundaries of existing states
2. Article 110                               :   Definition of a Money Bill
3. Article 169                               :   Abolition or creation of Legislative Councils
4. Article 356                               :   President's Rule in a state
5. Article 171                               :   Composition of the State Legislative Assemblies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Constitution deals with the formation of new states and the alteration of boundaries or names of existing states, a key provision concerning India's federal structure. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Article 110 precisely defines what constitutes a Money Bill in the Indian parliamentary system, a crucial aspect of financial legislation.  Thus, pair 2 is correct. Article 169 outlines the Parliament's power to abolish or create Legislative Councils in states, demonstrating the flexibility of India's federal system. Hence, pair 3 is correctly matched. Pair 4 is incorrect; Article 356 pertains to the President's power to impose President's Rule (also known as Governor's Rule) in a state under specific circumstances. Pair 5 is incorrect; Article 171 deals with the composition of the State Legislative Councils, not Assemblies.  The composition of the Legislative Assemblies is determined by various factors, including population and representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Act                            Key Feature
1. Government of India Act, 1919           :   Introduction of Dyarchy in provinces
2. Government of India Act, 1935           :   Establishment of an All-India Federation
3. Indian Councils Act, 1892               :   Expansion of legislative councils
4. Regulating Act, 1773                   :   Establishment of a Supreme Court in Calcutta
5. Indian Independence Act, 1947           :   Transfer of power from British to Indian hands


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1919, introduced the system of Dyarchy (dual government) at the provincial level, dividing powers between elected ministers and officials appointed by the British government.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The Government of India Act, 1935, established a federal structure in India, creating an All-India Federation with both a central and provincial governments. This Act laid the groundwork for India's later constitution. Hence, pair 2 is correct. The Indian Councils Act, 1892, expanded the legislative councils at both the central and provincial levels, though it was still largely a limited form of representation.  Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched. The Regulating Act, 1773, established a Supreme Court in Calcutta, marking a significant step in the development of the Indian judicial system under British rule. This was a crucial aspect of British administration. Hence, pair 4 is correct. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, finally transferred power from the British to Indian hands, paving the way for India's independence. Thus, pair 5 is correctly matched.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on the Indian Parliament, its relationship with the President, and the legislative process, including Money Bills and the Rajya Sabha's role.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body            Specific Function/Power
1. Lok Sabha                  :   Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
2. Rajya Sabha                 :   Can delay Money Bills for a maximum of 14 days
3. President of India          :   Can summon a joint sitting of Parliament to resolve a deadlock on an ordinary bill
4. Speaker of Lok Sabha       :   Certifies a bill as a Money Bill
5.  Parliament                 :  Establishes the Contingency Fund of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because all five pairs accurately reflect the functions and powers of the respective governmental bodies within the Indian constitutional framework.

* **Lok Sabha:**  The Lok Sabha holds the primary power to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President.  This is a crucial check and balance mechanism within the Indian political system.

* **Rajya Sabha:** The Rajya Sabha, while not possessing the power to reject or amend a Money Bill, can delay its passage for a maximum of 14 days. This limited power allows for some scrutiny of financial legislation.

* **President of India:** The President has the constitutional power to convene a joint sitting of Parliament to resolve deadlocks on ordinary bills and financial bills (excluding Money Bills). This power helps to ensure legislative efficiency.

* **Speaker of Lok Sabha:** The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the final authority in determining whether a bill is a Money Bill. This certification is critical for the legislative process of Money Bills.

* **Parliament:** The Parliament, as the supreme legislative body, establishes and controls the Contingency Fund of India, a crucial element of India's financial system.  The fund is used to meet unforeseen expenditures.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  These options demonstrate potential distractors for an examinee,  testing their comprehensive understanding of the Indian parliamentary system and its intricate workings.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

  Government Body             Action Regarding Bills
1. Lok Sabha                   :   Can introduce a Money Bill
2. Rajya Sabha                  :   Can amend an Ordinary Bill
3. President of India           :   Can withhold assent to an Ordinary Bill
4. Speaker of Lok Sabha        :   Can return a Money Bill for reconsideration
5. Rajya Sabha                  : Can initiate the removal of the Vice-President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer. Let's analyze each pair:

* **1. Lok Sabha: Can introduce a Money Bill:** This is correct. Only the Lok Sabha can introduce Money Bills.

* **2. Rajya Sabha: Can amend an Ordinary Bill:** This is correct. Rajya Sabha has the power to amend ordinary bills, although Lok Sabha has the final say.

* **3. President of India: Can withhold assent to an Ordinary Bill:** This is correct. The President has the power to withhold assent to any bill, including ordinary bills.

* **4. Speaker of Lok Sabha: Can return a Money Bill for reconsideration:** This is incorrect. The President, not the Speaker, can withhold assent or return a Money Bill (though not for reconsideration).  The Speaker's role is limited to certifying a bill as a Money Bill.

* **5. Rajya Sabha: Can initiate the removal of the Vice-President:** This is correct.  Only the Rajya Sabha can initiate the process of removing the Vice-President.


Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of the incorrect pair (4) and the correct pair (5) serves as a strong distractor, requiring the candidate to have a precise understanding of each body's powers.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article       Subject Matter
1. Article 110                    :   Definition of a Financial Bill
2. Article 112                    :   Annual Financial Statement (Budget)
3. Article 266                    :   Consolidated Fund of India
4. Article 267                    :   Contingency Fund of India
5. Article 117                    :  Procedure for Financial Bills (I) and (II)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs in option (c) are correctly matched.  Each article deals with the specific financial aspects of the Indian government as described in the source material.

* **Article 110:**  Defines what constitutes a Money Bill, a crucial aspect of the legislative process related to finance.

* **Article 112:** Deals with the Annual Financial Statement, commonly known as the budget.

* **Article 266:** Establishes the Consolidated Fund of India, the primary repository of government revenue.

* **Article 267:**  Establishes the Contingency Fund of India, designed for unforeseen expenditures.

* **Article 117:**  Outlines the procedure for Financial Bills (both type I and type II), which are bills that deal with financial matters but are not exclusively Money Bills.


Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs. The close relationship between the articles and their subjects makes this a challenging question, testing the candidate's deep understanding of the constitutional provisions related to finance.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                  Legislative Procedure Feature
1. Money Bill                    :   Can only be introduced in the Rajya Sabha
2. Ordinary Bill                  :   Can be amended by both Houses of Parliament
3. Financial Bill (I)             :   Requires President's recommendation for consideration
4. Financial Bill (II)            :   Cannot be introduced in either House without the President's recommendation
5. Constitutional Amendment Bill:  Requires a special majority for passage in both Houses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies the matched pairs.

* **Ordinary Bill:** Ordinary bills can be introduced in either house and are amendable by both houses.

* **Financial Bill (I):**  While the President's recommendation is required for introduction, the *consideration* of amendments (excluding those that increase taxes) also requires the President's recommendation.

* **Constitutional Amendment Bill:** These bills require a special majority for passage in both houses, reflecting their significance.

Pairs 1 and 4 are incorrect.  Money Bills are introduced *only* in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha (1).  For Financial Bill (II), the President's recommendation is necessary for *consideration*, not introduction (4).  These incorrect pairings are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuanced differences in the legislative processes for various types of bills.  The correct option (b) requires a thorough understanding of the subtle differences between these bill types.


**5. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following pairs:**

   Exclusive Power/Function                 Constitutional Article
1. Authorizing Parliament to legislate on State List items   : Article 249
2. Authorizing Parliament to create new All-India Services : Article 312
3. Initiating the removal of the Vice-President             : Article 67
4.  Overriding the Lok Sabha on Money Bills               : Article 110
5.  Preside over a Joint Sitting of Parliament             : Article 118


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct.  The Rajya Sabha holds specific powers detailed in Articles 249, 312, and 67.

* **Article 249:** Grants the Rajya Sabha the power to authorize Parliament to legislate on subjects within the State List in the national interest.

* **Article 312:** Allows the Rajya Sabha to authorize Parliament to create new All-India Services.

* **Article 67:**  Gives the Rajya Sabha the exclusive right to initiate a resolution for the removal of the Vice-President.

Pairs 4 and 5 are incorrect because Article 110 deals with the definition of a Money Bill, where the Rajya Sabha *cannot* override the Lok Sabha.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha Chairman, presides over a joint sitting (5). The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate’s precise knowledge of the Rajya Sabha’s constitutional powers and its relationship with other branches of government.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on the Indian Parliament and its functioning.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament          Specific Power or Function
1. Lok Sabha                      :   Sole power to decide whether a bill is a Money Bill
2. Rajya Sabha                    :   Initiates the removal of the Vice-President
3. Lok Sabha                      :   Introduces Money Bills
4. Rajya Sabha                    :   Can amend a Money Bill
5. Lok Sabha                      :  Presides over Joint Sittings (through the Speaker)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because:

* **Pair 1:** The Speaker of the Lok Sabha has the sole and final authority to determine whether a bill is a Money Bill. This is a crucial power that prevents the Rajya Sabha from obstructing financial legislation.

* **Pair 2:**  The Rajya Sabha has the exclusive power to initiate the removal of the Vice-President. This reflects a check and balance within the parliamentary system.

* **Pair 5:** The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over joint sittings of Parliament.  This is a key procedural aspect for resolving deadlocks between the two Houses.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

* **Pair 4:** The Rajya Sabha *cannot* amend or reject a Money Bill. It can only offer recommendations, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.

* Option (a) includes pair 4, which is incorrect.
* Option (c) omits pair 5, which is correct.
* Option (d) omits pair 1 and 2, which are correct.  


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Parliament:**

1. The President of India is required to recommend the introduction of a Money Bill in Parliament.
2. The Rajya Sabha can delay, but not permanently block, the passage of an ordinary bill.
3. A joint sitting of both Houses can be called to resolve a deadlock on any type of bill, including constitutional amendment bills.
4. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because:

* **Statement 1:** The President's recommendation is mandatory for the introduction of a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha, highlighting the executive's role in financial matters.

* **Statement 2:** The Rajya Sabha can delay an ordinary bill for a maximum of six months (excluding periods of prorogation or adjournment exceeding four days).  This reflects its revising role, but the Lok Sabha ultimately has the power to pass the bill.

* **Statement 4:** The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha, reflecting the principle of parliamentary accountability.  A vote of no confidence can only be moved in the Lok Sabha.

Statement 3 is incorrect. A joint sitting cannot be convened for Money Bills or Constitutional Amendment Bills.  The Lok Sabha has overriding powers on Money Bills, and Constitutional Amendment Bills require separate passage in each House.


**3. With reference to the composition and powers of the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision       Implication
1. Article 368                      :   Amendment of the Constitution
2. Article 110                      :   Definition of a Money Bill
3. Article 312                      :   Creation of All-India Services
4. Article 105                      :   Parliamentary Privileges
5. Article 79                       :   Composition of Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Each article accurately reflects the constitutional provision related to a specific aspect of the Indian Parliament.  The articles cover the core functions of the parliament, its composition, and the special rights and procedures that govern its operations.  There are no incorrect pairings in this question.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee      Primary Function
1. Public Accounts Committee    :   Examines the Finance Accounts of the Government of India
2. Estimates Committee           :   Scrutinizes the government's spending
3. Committee on Public Undertakings: Examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct.

* **Pair 1:** The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is indeed responsible for examining the Finance Accounts of the Government of India.  This ensures accountability in government spending.

* **Pair 2:** The Estimates Committee scrutinizes the government's proposed expenditure, ensuring efficient resource allocation.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Committee on Public Undertakings examines the working of public sector undertakings, not the reports of the CAG.  The CAG's reports are examined by the PAC.




**5.  With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha can initiate a motion for a vote of no confidence against the Council of Ministers.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.
3.  The Rajya Sabha's strength is fixed by the Constitution.
4. The Vice-President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The Vice-President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.  Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect:

* **Statement 1:**  The Rajya Sabha cannot initiate a no-confidence motion. This power is exclusive to the Lok Sabha.

* **Statement 2:** The Rajya Sabha cannot reject a Money Bill. It can only recommend amendments, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept.

* **Statement 3:** The maximum strength of the Rajya Sabha is fixed by the Constitution (250), but the current strength is less than that.  The Constitution does not fix the exact number.  It sets an upper limit.


These questions test not only factual knowledge but also the ability to analyze and evaluate the relationships between different aspects of the Indian parliamentary system.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate’s understanding of the nuanced powers and procedures of Parliament.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                 Specific Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                           :   Initiating impeachment proceedings against the President
2. Rajya Sabha                          :   Exclusive power to initiate removal of the Vice-President
3. Lok Sabha                           :   Passing a Money Bill
4. Rajya Sabha                          :   Authorizing Parliament to legislate on State List subjects during a national emergency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Lok Sabha holds the primary power to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President, a process requiring a special majority in both Houses. The Rajya Sabha uniquely holds the power to initiate the removal of the Vice-President, a process requiring an effective majority in the Rajya Sabha and a simple majority in the Lok Sabha.  Money Bills can only originate in the Lok Sabha, reflecting its role as the House of the People and its greater control over financial matters. The Rajya Sabha can, under Article 249, authorize Parliament to legislate on State List subjects if it deems it necessary in the national interest; this power is especially relevant during a national emergency when the Parliament's legislative jurisdiction expands.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the specific powers and functions of each House. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                  Function/Report Considered by Parliament
1. Union Public Service Commission      :   Appointment of judges to the Supreme Court
2. Comptroller and Auditor General     :    Auditing of government expenditure
3. Finance Commission                    :   Recommendations on the distribution of financial resources between the Centre and States
4. Election Commission                  :    Conduct of elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits government expenditure, and Parliament reviews the CAG's reports. The Finance Commission makes recommendations on the division of financial resources between the Union and States, and these recommendations are also considered by the Parliament.  Option (1) is incorrect because while the UPSC is involved in the appointment of some judicial officers, the President, on the advice of the Council of Ministers, makes the final appointments to the Supreme Court. Option (4) is incorrect because the Election Commission conducts elections, but its day-to-day functions are not directly overseen by Parliament.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                             House of Origin
1. Money Bill                              :   Rajya Sabha
2. Financial Bill (not solely Article 110) :   Lok Sabha
3. Ordinary Bill                            :   Either House


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only financial bills (excluding those solely under Article 110) and ordinary bills can be introduced in either House of Parliament. Money Bills, however, can only originate in the Lok Sabha.  Pair 1 is incorrect because Money Bills are exclusively introduced in the Lok Sabha.  Pair 2 is correct as Financial Bills (that are not solely Money Bills) can originate in either House. Pair 3 is also correct; ordinary bills can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee                  Function
1. Estimates Committee                     :   Examines the budget estimates of ministries
2. Public Accounts Committee               :   Scrutinizes the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General
3. Committee on Subordinate Legislation   :  Reviews the functioning of the Election Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Estimates Committee examines the budget estimates to ensure efficient allocation of resources. The Public Accounts Committee scrutinizes the CAG's reports to ensure accountability in government spending.  The Committee on Subordinate Legislation examines delegated legislation, not the Election Commission's functioning. The Election Commission's functions are scrutinized by the Parliament as a whole. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include an incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution             Subject Matter
1. Article 356                               :   Financial Emergency
2. Article 352                               :   National Emergency
3. Article 360                               :   President's Rule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only


**Explanation:**

Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency. Article 356 deals with President's Rule, and Article 360 deals with Financial Emergency.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly match at least one of the articles with the wrong subject matter.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                  Unique Power
1. Lok Sabha                            :   Final say on Money Bills
2. Rajya Sabha                           :   Power to initiate removal of Vice-President
3. Lok Sabha                            :   Power to pass a Vote of No Confidence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Lok Sabha has the final say on Money Bills, as they originate exclusively in this House.  The Rajya Sabha has the sole power to initiate the process of removing the Vice-President.  The Lok Sabha can pass a Vote of No Confidence against the Council of Ministers, leading to the government's resignation or dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, representing the unique powers of each House. The other options are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Language                                  Official Status in India
1. Hindi                                    :   National Language
2. English                                  :   Associate Official Language
3. Hindi and English                        :   Official Languages of the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Hindi is not the national language of India; it is an official language along with English.  English holds the status of an associate official language. Both Hindi and English are used in the Supreme Court, though other languages may be used at the discretion of the court.  Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**8. With reference to the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   State                                   Number of Rajya Sabha Seats
1. Uttar Pradesh                          :   31
2. Bihar                                  :   16
3. Andhra Pradesh                         :   11
4. Karnataka                              :   12


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Uttar Pradesh has 31 seats in the Rajya Sabha, and Andhra Pradesh has 11.  Bihar has 16 seats, and Karnataka has 12. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                                    Number of Seats in Lok Sabha
1. Uttar Pradesh                         :    80
2. Bihar                                  :    40
3. Andhra Pradesh                         :    25
4. Karnataka                              :    28


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Uttar Pradesh has 80 seats and Andhra Pradesh has 25 seats in the Lok Sabha. Bihar has 40 seats and Karnataka has 28 seats.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   List in the Seventh Schedule           Subject Matter
1. Union List                            :   Inter-state rivers
2. State List                            :   Public order
3. Concurrent List                       :   Criminal law


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Inter-state rivers are a subject of the Union List, public order falls under the State List, and criminal law is a subject of the Concurrent List.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                           Description
1. Judicial Review                         :   Power of judiciary to question the wisdom of laws
2. Rule of Law                             :   Equality before law and limitation of powers
3. Contempt of Court                     :   Disobeying a legitimate order of the court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Judicial review does not involve questioning the wisdom of laws, but rather their constitutionality. Rule of law encompasses equality before the law and the limitation of governmental powers. Contempt of court accurately describes disobeying a court's order. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pair involving judicial review.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Powers/Protection            Constitutional Basis
1. Immunity from criminal proceedings during tenure  :  Article 361
2. Emoluments cannot be diminished during tenure : Article 156
3. Power to summon and prorogue the State Legislature :  Article 175


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 361 grants immunity from criminal proceedings to the Governor during their tenure. Article 175 outlines the Governor's power to summon and prorogue the state legislature. Article 156 concerns the appointment of the Governor; the protection against diminution of emoluments is found in Article 361.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched ones.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

    Chief Minister's Responsibilities                   Constitutional Provision
1. Collective responsibility to the Legislative Assembly:  Article 164
2. Appointment by the Governor                        :   Article 163
3.  Member of either House of the State Legislature   : Article 164


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  The Chief Minister and their Council of Ministers are collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly (Article 164). The Governor appoints the Chief Minister (Article 163). The Chief Minister can be a member of either House of the State Legislature (Article 164).  Therefore, option (d) is correct. The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

    Feature of Indian Federalism                Characteristic
1. Independent Judiciary                      :   Judicial Review
2. Division of Powers                       :  Union, State, and Concurrent Lists
3. Unequal Representation in Rajya Sabha    :   Based on population of states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

An independent judiciary is a crucial feature of Indian federalism, enabling judicial review of laws.  The division of powers between the Union and States is defined by the Union, State, and Concurrent Lists in the Seventh Schedule.  Unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha reflects the federal structure, with seats allocated based on state populations. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct option. Other options are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Emergency                            Parliamentary Action
1. National Emergency                         :   Resolution passed by Lok Sabha alone suffices after Lok Sabha dissolution
2. President's Rule                           :   Resolution passed by Rajya Sabha alone suffices after Lok Sabha dissolution
3. Financial Emergency                       :   Resolution passed by either House suffices after Lok Sabha dissolution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

In the event of the Lok Sabha's dissolution, a proclamation of National Emergency or President's Rule can remain in effect if approved by the Rajya Sabha alone.  However, a Financial Emergency requires approval from both Houses, even if the Lok Sabha is dissolved. Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either incorrectly match or exclude correctly matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Subject                     Governing Body
1.  Taxation on Income from Property   :  State Legislature
2.  Forest Conservation                   :  Parliament
3.  Emergency Management                 :  Union Government
4.  Disaster Relief                       :  State Government
5.  Education                              :  Concurrent Legislative Power

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only pairs 2 and 5 accurately reflect the legislative jurisdiction.  Forest conservation, while having aspects within the Concurrent List, ultimately falls under the overarching authority of Parliament due to its national implications.  The Centre can legislate on matters in the Concurrent List, even if states have concurrent power, overriding state laws if necessary for national consistency. Education, similarly, is a subject in the Concurrent List, meaning both the Union and State governments can make laws on it.  

Pair 1 is incorrect as taxation on income from property primarily resides within the State List, although the Union has some powers related to indirect taxation.  Pair 3 is incorrect because while the Union Government has significant roles in emergency management, the actual implementation often involves collaboration with State Governments. Pair 4 is incorrect, as disaster relief is primarily a State subject, though the Union Government provides assistance and coordination.  The division of powers between the Union and States is complex and often involves cooperative federalism, making it crucial to understand the nuances of each subject's placement within the legislative lists.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                      Primary Function
1.  Finance Commission                    :   Auditing Government Expenditure
2.  National Development Council         :   Economic and Social Planning
3.  Inter-State Council                    :   Resolving Disputes between States
4.  Election Commission                    :   Conducting Elections for Lok Sabha
5.  Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):  Recommending Tax Rates

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) because only the National Development Council (NDC) and the Election Commission of India's functions are correctly paired.  The NDC is a crucial body for economic and social planning in India, involving the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, and Union Ministers. The Election Commission is constitutionally mandated to conduct free and fair elections for the Lok Sabha, among other bodies.

Pair 1 is incorrect because the CAG audits government expenditure, not the Finance Commission. The Finance Commission deals with the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States. Pair 3 is partly correct, the Inter-State Council deals with disputes between states, but its role is broader than just dispute resolution. Pair 5 is incorrect; the CAG does not recommend tax rates.  Taxation is determined by legislative processes, and the CAG's role is focused on auditing and accountability.  Understanding the distinct roles of these constitutional bodies is essential for comprehending India's governance structure.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative List                        Subject Matter
1. Union List                             :  Public Order
2. State List                              :  Education
3. Concurrent List                         :  Forestry
4. Residuary Powers                       :  Atomic Energy
5.  State List                              :  Criminal Procedure Code

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  The Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution includes forestry, allowing both the Union and State governments to legislate on the subject.  The State List encompasses subjects such as public order and criminal procedure, over which the State governments have primary legislative authority.

Pair 1 is incorrect; public order is a state subject. Pair 2 is incorrect as education is a concurrent subject. Pair 4 is incorrect as atomic energy is a Union subject, not a residuary power.  Residuary powers, which deal with subjects not explicitly listed in the Union, State, or Concurrent Lists, are vested in the Union Government.  Accurate knowledge of the distribution of legislative powers under the Seventh Schedule is critical for understanding India's federal structure.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                            Impact on Lok Sabha
1. 42nd Amendment Act of 1976             :   Increased the number of seats
2. 44th Amendment Act of 1978             :   Restored the original term length
3. 87th Amendment Act of 2003             :   Introduced anti-defection provisions
4. 84th Amendment Act of 2001             :   Made changes to the election system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 reversed the six-year term introduced by the 42nd Amendment, reverting the Lok Sabha’s term back to five years.

Pair 1 is incorrect; the 42nd Amendment did increase the number of seats, but its impact is not limited to the Lok Sabha; it affected other aspects of the constitution. Pair 3 is incorrect; anti-defection is covered by the Tenth Schedule, not the 87th Amendment. The 87th Amendment dealt with the reservation of seats for OBCs. Pair 4 is incorrect; the 84th Amendment relates to the right to education, it did not directly affect the Lok Sabha's election system.  A thorough understanding of the impacts of various constitutional amendment acts is essential for accurate analysis.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Power or Function
1.  Parliament                               :   Appoints the Governor
2.  President                                :   Nominates Anglo-Indian Members to Lok Sabha
3.  Election Commission                     :   Decides Disputes related to Political Party Splits
4.  Supreme Court                          :   Declares President’s Rule in a State
5.  Governor                                 :   Dissolves the State Legislative Assembly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 5 are accurately matched.  The President of India has the power to nominate members from the Anglo-Indian community to the Lok Sabha if he/she feels that the community is not adequately represented.  The Governor of a state has the constitutional power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly.

Pair 1 is incorrect; the Parliament does not appoint the Governor; the President does. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Election Commission of India does not decide disputes related to political party splits; this is a matter for the court. Pair 4 is incorrect; the Supreme Court does not declare President’s rule; the President does, based on the Governor's report. A clear understanding of the powers and functions of various constitutional bodies is crucial for accurate analysis of the Indian political system.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Lok Sabha and related parliamentary concepts.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria, including detailed explanations and analysis of options.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Legislative Body**                      **Key Function/Characteristic**
1. Lok Sabha                               :   Nominates members to the Rajya Sabha
2. Rajya Sabha                              :   Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
3. Lok Sabha                               :   Controls the size of the Council of Ministers
4. Parliament                              :   Passes the Annual Financial Statement
5. Rajya Sabha                              :   Has equal power with Lok Sabha on ordinary bills


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because:

* **Pair 3:** The Lok Sabha holds the executive accountable and indirectly controls the size of the Council of Ministers through its power to express no-confidence.  A government that loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha must resign.

* **Pair 4:** The Parliament, comprising the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, is responsible for passing the Annual Financial Statement (budget).  While the Lok Sabha has more power regarding financial bills, both houses must approve the budget.

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** The President, not the Lok Sabha, nominates members to the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).

* **Pair 2:** While both houses participate in the impeachment process, the Rajya Sabha initiates the process.  The Lok Sabha then considers the charges.

* **Pair 5:** The Rajya Sabha does not have equal power with the Lok Sabha on money bills.  The Lok Sabha has the final say on financial matters.  On ordinary bills, they have equal powers, with the Lok Sabha's decision prevailing in case of a deadlock.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   **House of Parliament**              **Specific Power/Responsibility**
1. Lok Sabha                             :  Election of the President
2. Rajya Sabha                            :   Presides over the Joint Sitting of Parliament
3. Lok Sabha                             :  Introduces Money Bills
4. Parliament                             :  Amendments to the Constitution
5. Rajya Sabha                            :  Removal of the Vice-President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is the correct answer:

* **Pair 3:**  Money Bills, which deal primarily with financial matters, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha.

* **Pair 4:**  The Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) possesses the power to amend the Constitution, following the prescribed procedures.

* **Pair 5:** The Rajya Sabha plays a crucial role in the removal of the Vice-President.  A resolution for removal is initiated and passed in the Rajya Sabha, and then the Lok Sabha needs to agree.


The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** Both Houses of Parliament participate in the election of the President, but neither house solely elects the President.


* **Pair 2:** The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting of Parliament.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Constitutional Body/Official**     **Power/Function related to Lok Sabha**
1. President                             :   Dissolves the Lok Sabha
2. Speaker                               :   Presides over the Lok Sabha
3. Election Commission                    :   Conducts elections for the Lok Sabha
4. Prime Minister                         :   Recommends dissolution of the Lok Sabha
5. Rajya Sabha                           :  Initiates no-confidence motion against the government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because:

* **Pair 1:** The President has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister.

* **Pair 2:** The Speaker is the presiding officer of the Lok Sabha.

* **Pair 3:** The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting the elections to the Lok Sabha.

* **Pair 4:**  The Prime Minister, as the head of the government, advises the President to dissolve the Lok Sabha, usually when facing a lack of confidence or to call for fresh elections.


Pair 5 is incorrect:

* **Pair 5:**  The Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, initiates no-confidence motions against the government.  While the Rajya Sabha can debate issues of national importance, the Lok Sabha holds the ultimate power to bring down a government.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    **Parliamentary Committee**          **Primary Function**
1. Committee on Public Accounts         :   Examines the Annual Financial Statement
2. Estimates Committee                   :   Scrutinizes the budget estimates
3. Committee on Subordinate Legislation:   Reviews delegated legislation
4. Public Accounts Committee             :   Examines reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)
5. Business Advisory Committee          :  Recommends the agenda for the House


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly matches the parliamentary committees with their primary functions:

* **Pair 2:** The Estimates Committee scrutinizes the budget estimates presented to Parliament to ensure efficient and effective government spending.

* **Pair 4:** The Public Accounts Committee examines the reports of the CAG, which audits government accounts, holding the executive accountable for financial matters.

* **Pair 5:** The Business Advisory Committee plays a vital role in planning the legislative agenda of the House, ensuring efficient use of parliamentary time.

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** The Committee on Public Accounts examines the CAG’s reports on government spending, not the Annual Financial Statement itself.  The Annual Financial Statement is passed by the Parliament.

* **Pair 3:** While the Committee on Subordinate Legislation does review delegated legislation, its focus is broader than just examining whether executive powers are properly exercised. It ensures that delegated powers are used within the legislative intent.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Article of the Constitution**       **Subject Matter related to Lok Sabha**
1. Article 81                               :   Qualifications for Lok Sabha membership
2. Article 100                              :   Powers, privileges, and immunities of Parliament
3. Article 111                              :   Assent to Bills by the President
4. Article 105                              :   Composition of Lok Sabha
5. Article 356                              :   President's Rule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because:

* **Pair 3:** Article 111 of the Indian Constitution deals with the President's power to assent to or withhold assent to Bills passed by Parliament.  This is directly relevant to the Lok Sabha's legislative process.

* **Pair 5:** Article 356 pertains to the President's power to impose President's Rule in a state, which can indirectly affect the Lok Sabha's functioning if the state legislative assembly is dissolved.

The other pairs are incorrect:


* **Pair 1:** Article 81 deals with the composition of the Lok Sabha, not the qualifications for membership.  Qualifications are covered under Article 84.

* **Pair 2:** Article 100 deals with the procedure of voting in the Houses of Parliament, not the powers, privileges, and immunities.  Article 105 addresses the latter.

* **Pair 4:** Article 105 addresses the powers, privileges, and immunities of Parliament, not the composition of the Lok Sabha.  Article 81 deals with that.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions on the Indian Parliament, based on the provided target content.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a strong understanding of the subject matter.  Note that the difficulty is inherent in the need for precise factual recall and the inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Act                      Year of Enactment
1.  Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010  :  1972
2.  Representation of the People Act, 1951  :  1961
3.  Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957  :  1950
4.  River Boards Act  :  1955
5.  Inter-State Water Disputes Act  :  1960

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are incorrectly matched.  The correct years of enactment are as follows:

1. Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010 was enacted in **2010**.
2. The Representation of the People Act, 1951 was enacted in **1951**.
3. The Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 was enacted in **1957**.
4. The River Boards Act was enacted in **1956**.
5. The Inter-State Water Disputes Act was enacted in **1956**.

The question tests factual recall regarding the enactment years of significant Indian legislation.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible dates, close to the actual years, making it challenging for candidates to rely on simple estimation or partial knowledge. The inclusion of multiple incorrect pairs increases the difficulty level and assesses the depth of a candidate's understanding.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Subject Matter
1. Article 3                              :   Formation of new states
2. Article 16                             :   Rights regarding employment
3. Article 17                             :   Abolition of untouchability
4. Article 245                           :   Extent of legislative power
5. Article 356                           :   President's Rule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the fundamental provisions of the Indian Constitution.  Article 3 deals with the formation of new states and alteration of areas, boundaries, or names of existing states. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. Article 17 abolishes untouchability. Article 245 defines the extent of laws made by Parliament. Article 356 deals with the power of the President to impose President's Rule in a state.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes the question challenging as the candidate needs complete and accurate knowledge to select the correct option.



**3. With reference to the powers of the Indian Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Power                                   Subject Area
1.  Legislative power over Union Territories  :  Sikkim
2.  Concurrent power with State Legislatures :  Goods and Services Tax (GST)
3.  Power to amend the Constitution       :   Fundamental Rights
4.  Power to create All-India Services      :    Puducherry
5.  Power to tax on Union List              :   Concurrent List

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The Indian Parliament has legislative power over Union Territories, including enacting laws for their governance.  The GST is a concurrent subject, meaning both the Parliament and State Legislatures have the power to legislate on it.  The Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, including articles related to Fundamental Rights, although this power is subject to judicial review. Pair 4 is incorrect as the power to create All-India Services lies with the Parliament, not specifically related to Puducherry.  Pair 5 is incorrect; the Union List is where the Union government has exclusive taxing powers.  The question assesses the candidate's grasp of the distribution of legislative and financial powers between the Union and States. The distractors are designed to test their ability to distinguish between similar-sounding concepts.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee                 Function
1.  Public Accounts Committee             :   Examines the reports of the Union Public Service Commission
2.  Estimates Committee                   :   Scrutinizes government spending
3.  Committee on Public Undertakings       :   Examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General
4.  Committee on Subordinate Legislation  :  Reviews delegated legislation
5.  Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) :  Reviews reports of the Finance Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Estimates Committee scrutinizes government expenditure to ensure efficiency and economy. The Committee on Public Undertakings examines the performance of public sector undertakings. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation reviews delegated legislation to ensure it aligns with the parent act and doesn't overreach. Pair 1 is incorrect because the UPSC reports to the Parliament, but the PAC doesn't directly examine these reports. Pair 5 is incorrect; the Finance Commission submits its reports to the President, not the DRSCs.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the functions of different parliamentary committees, demanding specific factual recall and understanding of their roles in parliamentary oversight.  The distractors are designed to test their knowledge of the committees' responsibilities and their relationships with other government bodies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Amendment Act             Key Provision
1.  First Amendment Act, 1951          :    Added Fundamental Duties
2.  Fourth Amendment Act, 1955         :    Curtailed Fundamental Rights
3.  Seventeenth Amendment Act, 1964    :    Defined “estate”
4.  Twenty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1971  :    Removed Right to Property as a Fundamental Right
5.  Forty-Second Amendment Act, 1976  :    Added Directive Principles


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Seventeenth Amendment Act, 1964, clarified the definition of "estate" in the context of land reforms. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1971, removed the right to property as a fundamental right, making it a legal right. The Forty-Second Amendment Act, 1976, added new Directive Principles to the Constitution.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the First Amendment Act added nine new clauses to Article 15 and 19 and not fundamental duties. Pair 2 is incorrect; the Fourth Amendment Act made changes to several articles, including Articles 15, 19, and 31 and did not curtail fundamental rights.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the evolution of the Indian Constitution through various amendments, testing their ability to recall specific amendments and their significant provisions. The distractors are carefully selected to include plausible but incorrect linkages between amendments and their effects.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India can return a Money Bill to the Lok Sabha for reconsideration.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill.
3.  The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None of the above
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct. The President cannot return a Money Bill; they can only assent to it or withhold assent.  The Rajya Sabha has no power to amend or reject a Money Bill; it can only recommend amendments.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the special procedure for Money Bills in the Indian Parliament, highlighting the unique powers of the Lok Sabha in financial matters.  The distractors are carefully designed to exploit potential misconceptions regarding the powers of the President and the Rajya Sabha in the context of Money Bills.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Type                                  Levied By
1.  Gift Tax                                   :   State Governments
2.  Wealth Tax                                :   Union Government
3.  Expenditure Tax                            :   Local Bodies
4.  Goods and Services Tax (GST)             :   Union Government and State Governments concurrently
5.  Customs Duty                              :   State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Wealth tax is levied by the Union Government. GST is a concurrent tax, levied by both the Union and State Governments. Customs duty is levied by the Union Government.  Pair 1 is incorrect; gift tax was a Union tax but has been abolished. Pair 3 is incorrect, expenditure tax is levied by the Union Government. Pair 5 is incorrect; customs duty is a Union tax.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian tax system and the division of taxing powers between the Union and State Governments.  The distractors test knowledge of different tax types and their respective levying authorities.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                    Accountable To
1.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   President
2.  Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) :   Parliament
3.  Finance Commission                    :   Parliament
4.  Election Commission                   :   Parliament
5.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC): President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The CAG is accountable to the Parliament. The Election Commission is also accountable to the Parliament.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the UPSC is accountable to the Parliament, not the President. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Finance Commission is not directly accountable to the Parliament. Its recommendations are submitted to the President, who then lays them before Parliament. Pair 5 is incorrect; The NHRC reports to the Parliament. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the accountability and reporting structures of various constitutional bodies in India. The distractors test their understanding of the relationship between these bodies and the legislature and executive.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                      Power/Function
1.  President                              :   Can override the legislative power of State Legislatures during emergencies
2.  Prime Minister                         :   Presides over the joint sitting of Parliament
3.  Governor                               :   Nominates members to the Rajya Sabha
4.  Speaker of Lok Sabha                  :   Can dissolve the Lok Sabha
5.  Chief Justice of India                 :   Appoints other judges of the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The President can use their emergency powers to override State legislation.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Prime Minister does not preside over joint sittings of Parliament; the Deputy Speaker does. The President nominates members to the Rajya Sabha, not the Governor. The President dissolves the Lok Sabha, not the Speaker.  The President appoints other Supreme Court judges on the advice of the CJI, not the CJI themselves. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the powers and functions of different branches of the Indian government, including the executive and legislature. The distractors are designed to test their ability to distinguish between the roles of various constitutional figures.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bill                                    Special Provision
1. Money Bill                                   :   Can be introduced only in Rajya Sabha
2. Financial Bill                               :   Requires prior recommendation from the President
3. Ordinary Bill                                :   Can be introduced in either House
4. Constitution Amendment Bill              :   Requires a special majority for passage
5. Appropriation Bill                           :   Cannot be amended by Rajya Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Financial bills require the President's prior recommendation. Ordinary Bills can be introduced in either House of Parliament. Constitution Amendment Bills require a special majority for passage (Article 368).  Pair 1 is incorrect; Money Bills can only be introduced in Lok Sabha. Pair 5 is incorrect; the Rajya Sabha cannot amend an Appropriation Bill, but it can only return it with recommendations.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of different types of bills and their procedures in Parliament, requiring accurate recall of the special provisions associated with each type. The distractors are designed to test their knowledge of the procedural aspects of bill passage.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   President of India's Action          Constitutional Provision/Body Involved
1.  Granting pardon to a convict       :   Article 72
2.  Appointment of Governors           :   Article 155
3.  Addressing a joint sitting of Parliament: Article 87
4.  Recommendation for Money Bill       :  Lok Sabha
5.  Constituting the GST Council        :   Article 279A

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The President of India possesses significant powers under the Indian Constitution.  Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence.  Article 155 clearly outlines the President's role in appointing the Governors of States. Article 87 empowers the President to address either House of Parliament or both Houses assembled together. The Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in the process of Money Bills; the President can only give assent to a Money Bill after it has been passed by the Lok Sabha.  Finally, Article 279A established the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, with the President of India being a key component in its constitution.  All five pairs accurately reflect the President's constitutional roles and actions.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   President of India's Power           Nature of the Power
1.  Veto power over Bills              :   Absolute Veto
2.  Dissolution of Lok Sabha           :   Conditional Power
3.  Appointment of the Prime Minister :   Based on Majority Support
4.  Addressing Parliament              :   Constitutional Duty
5.  Granting Pardons                  : Discretionary Power

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The President's powers are a complex interplay of discretionary and conditional actions. While the President possesses veto power over bills passed by Parliament, it's not an absolute veto in the strictest sense (suspensive veto is more accurate).  However, the statement remains factually true as the President can withhold assent.  The President's power to dissolve the Lok Sabha is conditional, requiring the advice of the Prime Minister.  The appointment of the Prime Minister is based on the principle of majority support in the Lok Sabha.  Addressing Parliament is a constitutional duty of the President. The power to grant pardons is a discretionary power, though often exercised based on advice. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Other options incorrectly exclude at least one accurate pairing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                  Function Related to the President
1.  Parliament                           :  Impeachment of the President
2.  Supreme Court                       :  Advice on Legal Matters
3.  Electoral College                   :   Election of the President
4.  Union Public Service Commission   :   Appointment of President's Staff
5.  Finance Commission                 :  Determination of President's Salary

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The President's relationship with various constitutional bodies is clearly defined.  Parliament has the power to impeach the President.  The Supreme Court can provide legal advice to the President (though not on its own initiative). The Electoral College is responsible for electing the President. However, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and the Finance Commission do not directly handle the appointment of the President's staff or the determination of the President's salary; those processes involve other constitutional provisions. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pairs 4 and/or 5.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article of the Constitution         Subject Matter
1.  Article 5                            :  Citizenship
2.  Article 6                            :  Citizenship of certain persons of Indian origin
3.  Article 14                           :  Right to Equality
4.  Article 21                           :  Protection of life and personal liberty
5.  Article 324                          :  Election Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

This question tests the knowledge of fundamental articles of the Indian Constitution. Article 5 deals with citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution. Article 6 addresses citizenship rights for certain persons of Indian origin. Article 14 guarantees the right to equality. Article 21 protects the right to life and personal liberty.  Article 324 establishes the Election Commission of India.  All the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    President's Power                    Method of Exercise
1.  Proclamation of Emergency         :   On his own discretion
2.  Appointment of Attorney General   :   On the advice of the Prime Minister
3.  Dissolution of Lok Sabha           :   On the advice of the Prime Minister
4.  Granting Assent to Bills            :   Can withhold assent
5.  Addressing Parliament               :   Constitutional Duty


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

This question examines the President's powers and how they are exercised. The President's power to proclaim an emergency is not entirely discretionary; while the decision rests with the President, it often follows consultation with the Cabinet. The appointment of the Attorney General is made on the advice of the Prime Minister. The dissolution of the Lok Sabha is also based on the Prime Minister's advice. The President can withhold assent to bills, and addressing Parliament is a constitutional duty.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly include or exclude  the correct pairings.  The subtle difference in the exercise of the emergency power makes option (c) the most accurate.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Provision Related To
1. Article 76                     :  Appointment of Attorney General of India
2. Article 143                    :  Advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
3. Article 324                    :  Election Commission of India
4. Article 368                    :  Amendment of the Constitution
5. Article 263                    :   Inter-State Council

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

Article 76 of the Indian Constitution deals with the appointment of the Attorney General of India.  The Attorney General is the highest law officer of the Government of India and advises the government on legal matters.  Article 143 pertains to the advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, allowing the President to seek the court's opinion on any question of law or fact. Article 324 establishes the Election Commission of India, an independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections. Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution of India, a complex process requiring specific majorities in Parliament. Article 263 empowers the President to establish an Inter-State Council to resolve disputes and foster cooperation among states. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete because they omit correctly matched pairs.  The inclusion of Article 143 in options (b) and (c) might be a distractor, as it's less directly related to the core theme of the other articles, which focus on the structure and functioning of the Indian government.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body               Power/Function
1. Parliament                    :  Appoints the Chief Justice of India
2. President                      :  Appoints Governors of States
3. Lok Sabha                     :  Elects the Speaker
4. Rajya Sabha                   :  Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
5. Supreme Court                  :  Declares laws unconstitutional


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Governors of States (pair 2). The Lok Sabha elects its own Speaker (pair 3).  The Rajya Sabha plays a crucial role in the impeachment process of the President, initiating the proceedings (pair 4). The Supreme Court possesses the power of judicial review, enabling it to declare laws unconstitutional (pair 5).  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Parliament (not solely the President) appoints the Chief Justice of India. This might serve as a distractor, as the President plays a significant role in the judicial appointment process, but the final power resides with the Parliament.  The other options are incomplete, making (d) the only fully correct answer. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the distribution of powers within the Indian governmental system.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Position                  Requirement/Attribute
1.  Attorney General of India     :   Must be a member of Parliament
2.  Solicitor General of India    :   Appointed by the Prime Minister
3.  Governor of a State           :   Appointed by the President
4.  Chief Justice of India         :   Appointed by the Chief Election Commissioner
5.  Judge of a High Court         :  Must possess legal qualifications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Solicitor General of India is appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister (pair 2). The Governor of a State is appointed by the President of India (pair 3).  Judges of High Courts must meet specific legal qualifications (pair 5).  Pairs 1 and 4 are incorrect. The Attorney General of India is not required to be a member of Parliament, and the Chief Justice of India is appointed by the President, not the Chief Election Commissioner.  These incorrect pairs serve as plausible distractors for candidates who may have a partial understanding of the appointment processes. Option (c) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating an understanding of the constitutional framework and the qualifications and appointment procedures for key legal and political positions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                Legislative Power/Function
1. Parliament                     :  Exclusive power to legislate on the Union List
2. State Legislature              :  Exclusive power to legislate on the Concurrent List
3. Lok Sabha                      :  Power to introduce Money Bills
4. Rajya Sabha                    :  Power to amend the Constitution independently
5. President                      :  Power to veto bills


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Parliament has the exclusive power to legislate on matters listed in the Union List (pair 1). The Lok Sabha holds the exclusive power to introduce Money Bills (pair 3). The President has the power to veto bills passed by Parliament (pair 5). Pairs 2 and 4 are incorrect. State Legislatures have concurrent legislative power along with Parliament on the Concurrent List, and the Rajya Sabha does not have the power to independently amend the Constitution.  The Constitution mandates that constitutional amendments must be passed by both houses of Parliament. These incorrect pairs act as distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of the precise division of legislative powers between the Union and the States, and the roles of different governmental bodies in the legislative process. Option (b) correctly identifies the accurate pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                Provision/Impact
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act : Created the office of the Chief Election Commissioner
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act : Established Metropolitan Planning Committees
3. 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act  : Added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution
4. 44th Constitutional Amendment Act  : Limited the power of the President to dissolve the Lok Sabha
5. First Amendment Act             :  Added certain restrictions on fundamental rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, established Metropolitan Planning Committees for urban development (pair 2).  The 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976, introduced Fundamental Duties into the Constitution (pair 3). The First Amendment Act, 1951,  introduced certain reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights to maintain public order and security (pair 5). Pairs 1 and 4 are incorrect. The office of the Chief Election Commissioner is not created by the 73rd Amendment, but rather by the Constitution itself, and the 44th Amendment did not limit the President's power to dissolve the Lok Sabha; it actually restored some of the President's powers that were curtailed by the 42nd Amendment.  These incorrect pairs serve as plausible distractors, testing candidates' knowledge of specific constitutional amendments and their impact on the Indian political system. Option (c) is the only option that correctly identifies the matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister                     Associated Event/Policy
1. Indira Gandhi                       :   National Emergency
2. Lal Bahadur Shastri                 :   Indo-Pak War of 1965
3. Morarji Desai                       :   Green Revolution
4. Rajiv Gandhi                        :   Panchayati Raj

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Indira Gandhi declared the National Emergency in 1975, a significant event in Indian political history.  Lal Bahadur Shastri's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by the Indo-Pak War of 1965, a defining moment in India's foreign policy.  Rajiv Gandhi's government played a crucial role in implementing the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments, which led to the revitalization of Panchayati Raj institutions at the local level.  The Green Revolution, however,  began gaining momentum during the tenure of Lal Bahadur Shastri and continued under Indira Gandhi.  While Morarji Desai was Prime Minister during a period of the Green Revolution's impact, it's inaccurate to attribute its inception or primary implementation to him.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they inaccurately link Prime Ministers to specific events or policies. Option (c) accurately matches Indira Gandhi with the National Emergency, Lal Bahadur Shastri with the Indo-Pak War, and Rajiv Gandhi with the Panchayati Raj system.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister                      Characteristic of their Premiership
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                    :   Non-Aligned Movement
2. Charan Singh                         :   Operation Flood
3. Manmohan Singh                      :   Economic Liberalization
4. A.B. Vajpayee                       :   Pokhran-II Nuclear Tests

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru was instrumental in establishing India's Non-Aligned Movement policy during the Cold War, a defining characteristic of his long premiership.  A.B. Vajpayee's government oversaw the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, a significant decision with lasting geopolitical consequences. Manmohan Singh's tenure is strongly associated with the continuation and deepening of economic liberalization policies that began in 1991.  Operation Flood, a significant dairy development program, however,  was primarily associated with the work of Verghese Kurien and the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), spanning several Prime Ministers' terms, and not directly attributable to Charan Singh's short-lived premiership.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect, as they misattribute policies or events to specific Prime Ministers. Option (d) correctly identifies the key characteristics of Nehru, Vajpayee, and Singh's respective terms.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Party                      Prime Minister Elected
1. Janata Party                         :   Charan Singh
2. Congress Party                       :   Rajiv Gandhi
3. Janata Dal                           :   H.D. Deve Gowda
4. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)        :   Atal Bihari Vajpayee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rajiv Gandhi was elected Prime Minister as the leader of the Indian National Congress. H.D. Deve Gowda served as Prime Minister as the leader of the Janata Dal. Atal Bihari Vajpayee led the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power and became Prime Minister.  Charan Singh, however,  became Prime Minister not as the leader of the Janata Party. While he was a prominent member of the Janata Party,  he led a minority government formed after the Janata Party split.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they wrongly associate Prime Ministers with the parties they primarily led to power. Option (b) accurately reflects the party affiliations of Rajiv Gandhi, H.D. Deve Gowda and Atal Bihari Vajpayee during their respective premierships.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister                      Major Domestic Policy Initiative
1. Indira Gandhi                       :   Nationalization of Banks
2. Morarji Desai                       :   Abolition of Privy Purses
3. P.V. Narasimha Rao                 :   Implementation of the Mandal Commission Report
4. Narendra Modi                       :   GST Implementation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Indira Gandhi's government nationalized 14 major commercial banks in 1969, a significant step in socialist economic policy. Morarji Desai's government abolished the privy purses of former princely states, a landmark decision with implications for social equality. Narendra Modi's government implemented the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a major tax reform.  The implementation of the Mandal Commission Report, however, though debated during P.V. Narasimha Rao's tenure, was primarily implemented in the subsequent years and cannot be solely attributed to his government.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misattribute policies to specific Prime Ministers or include incorrect pairings.  Option (b) correctly matches Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai, and Narendra Modi with their major domestic policy initiatives.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister                      Significant Foreign Policy Event
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                    :   Simla Agreement
2. Rajiv Gandhi                        :   Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
3. A.B. Vajpayee                       :   Visit to Pakistan
4. Narendra Modi                       :   Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) membership

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru's premiership saw the beginnings of India's relationship with many countries and the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement.  A.B. Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan in 1999 was a significant step towards improving relations between the two nations. Narendra Modi's government secured India's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), expanding its strategic partnerships.  While Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister during the time the NPT was being debated internationally, India did not sign the treaty under his tenure, choosing to maintain its nuclear option.  The Simla Agreement was signed in 1972, after Nehru's death, and is associated with Indira Gandhi's premiership.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccurate pairings. Option (c) accurately reflects the major foreign policy events associated with Nehru, Vajpayee, and Modi.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

**Explanation:**

Article 29 of the Indian Constitution safeguards the rights of minorities to conserve their distinct language, script, or culture. Article 324 vests the Election Commission with the power to supervise, direct, and control all elections to Parliament and State Legislatures. Article 370, now repealed, contained temporary provisions relating to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 82 deals with the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha, representing the states and union territories.  Article 170 outlines the composition of the Legislative Assemblies of the states. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.

The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947, regulates the export of ancient artifacts. The Public Records Act, 1993, manages the preservation and access to government records. The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, aims at protecting India's cultural heritage.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Eighth Schedule of the Constitution lists the official languages recognized by the Indian government. Part VI deals with the organization of states within the Indian federation.  Part VII describes the administration of Union Territories. Part VIII is dedicated to the Union, defining its structure and powers. Part IX covers the establishment and functioning of Panchayats (local self-government institutions). All five pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the structural organization of the Indian Constitution.  Other options are incorrect as they do not include all correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitutional framework, consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                      Formation Basis

The High Courts are established and governed by Articles 214-231 of the Constitution.  State Governments are defined in Part VI. The Union Government's structure is laid out in Part V.  The organization of Parliament is detailed in Articles 79-122.  The Election Commission's establishment and powers are given in Article 324.  All five pairs are correctly matched, reflecting a strong understanding of the constitutional basis for the creation and functioning of various government bodies in India.  Other options are incomplete, failing to include all correctly matched pairs.

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the entire territory of India. High Courts exercise jurisdiction over specified states and union territories. Gram Nyayalayas operate within rural areas of a district. Lok Adalats can deal with pre-litigative matters but not exclusively pending cases; they primarily focus on amicable settlements. Arbitration tribunals handle disputes as agreed upon by involved parties.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correct pairing or include an incorrect one. Option (c) accurately reflects the jurisdictional scope of three legal institutions.

The appointment of Supreme Court judges is done through a collegium system involving the Chief Justice of India and senior judges. The President appoints High Court judges in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor of the concerned state. The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner. All five pairs are correctly matched, reflecting a solid grasp of the appointment processes for key legal and constitutional positions in India.  The other options are incorrect because they miss at least one correctly matched pair.

5.  President of India                         :  Pranab Mukherjee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

S.Y. Quraishi served as the Chief Election Commissioner of India. M.N. Venkatachaliah served as the Chief Justice of India. P.V. Narasimha Rao served as a Union Cabinet Minister, and Pranab Mukherjee served as the President of India.  Option (d) correctly identifies all these pairings.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correct pairing. Option (a) wrongly excludes the correct pairings of  Venkatachaliah and Mukherjee. Option (b) wrongly excludes Mukherjee. Option (c) wrongly excludes Rao. The distractors in the incorrect options use names of prominent individuals associated with high offices, making them plausible but ultimately false.  The question tests factual recall of individuals and their positions within the Indian political system.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Chairman/Head
1. Election Commission                         :  Union Cabinet Minister

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Chief Justice of India heads the National Judicial Commission. The Prime Minister of India heads NITI Aayog.  These are established facts about the Indian governmental structure. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the heads of the organizations listed. Option (a) incorrectly suggests that only the Election Commission has a correctly matched pairing, and that pairing is incorrect itself as the Election Commission is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner. Option (c) is incorrect because the National Human Rights Commission's chairperson can be selected from various qualified individuals, not necessarily the Chief Election Commissioner, and the Finance Commission is appointed by the President, not the other way around. Option (d) wrongly limits the correct pairings to only NITI Aayog.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the organizational structure of key Indian institutions, requiring knowledge beyond the most basic level.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Institution                                 Appointment Authority

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the members of the Union Public Service Commission.  This is a straightforward fact directly related to the constitutional provisions regarding the appointment of UPSC members. All other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the appointing authority for the respective positions. The Chief Election Commissioner is appointed by the President, not the Parliament. The Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the President, not the Lok Sabha. Governors are appointed by the President, not the Chief Justice of India. The Finance Commission is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the constitutional provisions regarding appointments and their understanding of the Indian administrative structure.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Power/Function                                 Holder of Power

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India has the power to recommend the introduction of Money Bills in Parliament.  The Governor of a State possesses the power to grant pardons, reprieves, and remissions of punishment within their respective states.  These are established facts regarding the powers of the President and Governors under the Indian Constitution. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, is dissolved by the President. The President, not the Prime Minister, promulgates ordinances. The President, not the Chief Justice, appoints the Prime Minister. The question tests the candidate’s detailed understanding of the distribution of powers among different constitutional bodies and officials.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                          Specific Power/Function
1.  Lok Sabha                                   :  Initiates Impeachment of the President
2.  Rajya Sabha                                 :   Exclusive Power to Initiate Money Bills
3.  Joint Sitting of Parliament                 :  Resolves Deadlocks on Ordinary Bills

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha initiates the impeachment process for the President. A joint sitting of Parliament resolves deadlocks between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on ordinary bills. The Lok Sabha elects its Speaker.  These are all accurate reflections of the parliamentary procedures and powers under the Indian Constitution. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, initiates money bills. The President, not the Rajya Sabha, nominates members to the Rajya Sabha. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the functions and procedures of the Indian Parliament, including the interplay between the two houses.  The inclusion of plausible distractors like the incorrect assignment of powers to the Rajya Sabha makes the question challenging.


**6. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                      Subject Matter
1. Article 74                                   :  Council of Ministers
2. Article 156                                  :  Tenure of Governor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

Article 74 deals with the Council of Ministers at the Union level. Article 156 specifies the term of office of a Governor. Article 356 pertains to President's Rule in states. Article 163 relates to the Council of Ministers at the State level. Article 111 outlines the President's powers regarding assent to bills passed by Parliament.  All the pairings are correct and directly sourced from the articles mentioned in the Indian Constitution. The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific articles and their corresponding constitutional provisions, demanding precise factual recall.  The inclusion of multiple articles makes it a challenging question.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Body/Official                   Primary Function
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)     :  Conducts elections

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only

(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits government accounts. The President of India appoints the Governors of states.  These are core responsibilities outlined in the Indian Constitution. Option (c) correctly identifies these. The other options are incorrect because they misattribute functions. The UPSC conducts recruitment for civil services, not elections. The Chief Election Commissioner conducts elections, not audits.  The President, not the Prime Minister, appoints High Court Judges. The Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers, not the President.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles and responsibilities of key constitutional bodies and officials, demanding precise knowledge.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related but distinct functions.

1. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Position                                    Appointing Authority
1.  Chief Justice of India                   :  President of India
2.  Judges of the Supreme Court             :  Prime Minister of India
3.  Governors of States                     :  Chief Justice of India
4.  Attorney General of India                :  President of India
5.  Members of the Union Public Service Commission:  Lok Sabha Speaker

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 4 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and the Attorney General of India.  The appointment of the CJI is crucial as it initiates a chain of appointments for other Supreme Court judges. The Attorney General is the government's chief legal advisor and holds a significant position, directly appointed by the President. Option (a) correctly identifies these two instances.

Option (b) is incorrect because while the President appoints members of the UPSC, the Lok Sabha Speaker does not play a role in this appointment process. The President, in consultation with the Prime Minister, appoints members of the UPSC. Option (c) is wrong as Governors of States are appointed by the President of India, not the Chief Justice of India.  Option (d) is incorrect as it includes several incorrectly matched pairs. The Prime Minister does not appoint Supreme Court judges; the President does, based on the advice of the CJI.


2. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                Function
1.  Finance Commission                 :   Supervises the functioning of the Planning Commission
2.  Union Public Service Commission   :  Conducts elections to the Parliament
3.  Election Commission               :   Advises the President on matters of finance
4.  National Human Rights Commission :  Appoints the Chief Election Commissioner
5.  National Green Tribunal           :  Deals with environmental disputes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for conducting free and fair elections, including those for Parliament. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a specialized body that adjudicates environmental disputes.  These are correctly matched.

Option (a) is incorrect as the Finance Commission makes recommendations on the distribution of financial resources between the Centre and States; it does not supervise the Planning Commission (which has been replaced by NITI Aayog).  The UPSC conducts recruitment for civil services, not elections. The President consults the Finance Commission on financial matters, not the other way around.  Finally, the President appoints the members of the National Human Rights Commission, not the Chief Election Commissioner.


3. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Veto Power Type                  Description
1.  Absolute Veto                    :   The President can reject a bill completely and permanently.
2.  Qualified Veto                    :   The President can reject a bill only once.
3.  Suspensive Veto                   :   The President can temporarily withhold assent to a bill, allowing for reconsideration by the Parliament.
4.  Pocket Veto                      :  The President neither signs nor returns a bill within the stipulated time.
5.  Pocket Veto                      :  The President returns a bill to Parliament with suggestions for amendment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

An absolute veto allows the President to completely reject a bill. A suspensive veto means the President can return a bill to Parliament for reconsideration. A pocket veto happens when the President neither signs nor returns the bill before the session ends, effectively killing it. These three are accurate descriptions.

Option (a) is incomplete because it omits the correct pairing for Pocket Veto. Option (b) is incorrect as it incorrectly pairs Qualified Veto and Pocket Veto. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect description of Pocket Veto.  The President does not return a bill with suggestions for amendment as part of a pocket veto.


4. **With reference to the President of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Power/Function                      Article
1.  Impeachment                         :   Article 70
2.  Pardon, reprieve, etc.               :   Article 72
3.  Addressing Parliament                :   Article 87
4.  Dissolution of Lok Sabha             :   Article 85
5.  Proclamation of Financial Emergency :   Article 360


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4 and 5 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Articles 72, 85, and 360 correctly relate to the President's powers of pardon, Lok Sabha dissolution, and financial emergency proclamation, respectively.  These are correctly matched.

Option (b) is incorrect because Article 70 deals with the procedure for disputes in the election of the Vice-President, not impeachment of the President (which is covered by Article 61).  Article 87 deals with the President's address to both houses of Parliament, not just Parliament alone. Option (c) omits the correct matching of Article 85. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes several incorrectly matched pairs.


5. **With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following pairs:**

   Power/Function                                     Correct Statement
1.  Appointment of Chief Minister                 :  Appoints the leader of the party with a majority in the Legislative Assembly
2.  Dissolution of Legislative Assembly             :  Can dissolve the Assembly on the advice of the Chief Minister
3.  Recommendation for President's Rule           :  Can recommend President's Rule to the President if the State government fails
4.  Granting Pardons                             :  Can grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment for offenses against State laws
5.  Appointment of High Court Judges              :  Plays a role in the consultation process, but the President makes the final appointment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Governor appoints the Chief Minister, can dissolve the Legislative Assembly, can recommend President's Rule, and has the power to pardon those convicted under state law. These are accurate representations of the Governor's powers.

Option (a) is incomplete; it omits the correct matching for President's Rule. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits several correctly matched pairs.  Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the Governor appoints High Court Judges independently.  While consulted, the final appointment rests with the President of India.



6. **With reference to the Parliament of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                        Function
1.  Committee on Public Accounts                  :   Examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)
2.  Committee on Estimates                        :   Examines the estimates included in the budget
3.  Committee on Public Undertakings               :  Scrutinizes the working of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)
4.  Department Related Standing Committees (DRSCs):  Scrutinizes the functioning of the Supreme Court
5.  Business Advisory Committee                    :  Advises the Speaker on the allocation of time for legislative business


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Committee on Public Accounts examines CAG reports, the Committee on Estimates reviews budget estimates, the Committee on Public Undertakings scrutinizes PSUs, and the Business Advisory Committee advises the Speaker on time allocation. These functions are accurately described.

Option (a) omits the correct function of the Business Advisory Committee. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect pairing for DRSCs; they do not scrutinize the Supreme Court's functioning. Option (d) is incorrect as it incorrectly includes the matching for DRSCs.


7. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Key Provision/Feature
1.  Government of India Act, 1935               :   Establishment of the Federal Court
2.  42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976     :  Inclusion of Fundamental Duties
3.  44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978     :  Restriction on the power of judicial review
4.  73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992     :   Establishment of the National Green Tribunal
5.  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989:  Provisions for the protection of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, established the Federal Court. The 42nd Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, provides for the protection of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from atrocities.  These are correctly matched.

Option (b) is incorrect because the 44th Amendment Act did not restrict judicial review; it actually restored some of the powers of judicial review that had been curtailed by the 42nd Amendment. The National Green Tribunal was established by a separate Act, not a constitutional amendment. Option (c) omits the correct matching of the Government of India Act, 1935 and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes several incorrectly matched pairs.


8. **Consider the following pairs:**

  Legal Concept                              Article of the Constitution
1.  Right to Equality                          :   Article 24
2.  Right to Freedom of Religion                :   Article 17
3.  Right against Exploitation                  :   Article 23
4.  Right to Constitutional Remedies            :   Article 32
5.  Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression :   Article 19


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Articles 23, 32, and 19 correctly correspond to the Right against Exploitation, Right to Constitutional Remedies, and Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression respectively. These are correctly matched.

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of Articles 19 and 32. Option (b) is incorrect because it incorrectly matches Article 24 with the Right to Equality (Article 14) and Article 17 with the Right to Freedom of Religion (Article 25). Option (c) omits the correct matching of Article 32 and Article 19.


9. **With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Subject                                       List
1.  Education                                     :   Union List
2.  Forests                                       :   State List
3.  Public Order                                  :   Concurrent List
4.  Criminal Procedure Code                      :   State List
5.  Inter-State Rivers and River Valleys           :   Union List


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Education is a concurrent subject, forests are a state subject, public order is a state subject (although some aspects can be concurrent), and Inter-State rivers are a Union subject.  Thus, options 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of the Union List and Concurrent List entries. Option (b) is also incorrect because it incorrectly places the Criminal Procedure Code in the State List (it's a Union subject). Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect matching for the Criminal Procedure Code.


10. **Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment Act                 Specific Provision/Amendment
1.  First Amendment Act, 1951                   :   Added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution
2.  Seventh Amendment Act, 1956                 :   Included Sikkim in the Indian Union
3.  Twenty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1971           :   Curtailed the power of judicial review
4.  Forty-Second Amendment Act, 1976            :   Added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution
5.  Forty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1978            :   Provided for the appointment of the same person as Governor for two or more states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Seventh Amendment Act included Sikkim, and the Forty-Second Amendment Act added Fundamental Duties. These are correctly matched.

Option (b) is incorrect because the First Amendment did not add the Ninth Schedule; that was added later. Option (c) is incorrect as the Twenty-Fourth Amendment did not curtail judicial review, and the Forty-Fourth Amendment did not specify a provision for the Governor. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes several incorrectly matched pairs.  The Twenty-Fourth Amendment dealt with the amendment procedure itself, not the curtailment of judicial review. The power to appoint the same person as Governor for two or more states is not a specific provision in the 44th Amendment.  It is a practical outcome and a convention.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on the Indian Legislature and related entities.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                  Power/Function
    1. Lok Sabha                         :   Nominates Anglo-Indian members to the Parliament
    2. Rajya Sabha                        :   Initiates impeachment proceedings against the President
    3.  President                          :  Appoints the Chief Election Commissioner
    4. Governor                           :  Dissolves the State Legislative Assembly
    5.  Council of Ministers             : Presides over joint sittings of Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because:

* **Pair 2:** The Rajya Sabha, along with the Lok Sabha, plays a crucial role in the impeachment process of the President.  While the Lok Sabha initiates the process, the Rajya Sabha's concurrence is essential for the removal.

* **Pair 3:** The President of India holds the power to appoint the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners. This appointment is a key aspect of maintaining the independence of the Election Commission.

* **Pair 4:** The Governor of a state possesses the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, usually on the advice of the Chief Minister. This power is a vital component of the state's political system.

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** The President, not the Lok Sabha, nominates Anglo-Indian members to Parliament (if the President deems their representation inadequate).

* **Pair 5:** The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, not the Council of Ministers, presides over joint sittings of Parliament.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body             Key Responsibility
    1. Union Public Service Commission :   Audits government accounts
    2. Comptroller and Auditor General :   Conducts elections
    3. Election Commission             :   Appoints civil servants
    4. Finance Commission              :   Recommends revenue distribution between Centre and States
    5. National Human Rights Commission:  Investigates human rights violations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched:

* **Pair 4:** The Finance Commission's primary role is to review the financial position of the Union and the states and recommend the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and duties between them. This is a crucial function in maintaining fiscal federalism.

* **Pair 5:** The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is responsible for investigating complaints of human rights violations and recommending remedial measures. This is a key institution for upholding human rights in India.

The other pairs are incorrect due to the following reasons:

* **Pair 1:** The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is responsible for conducting examinations for recruitment to various government services. It does not audit government accounts. That is the CAG's role.

* **Pair 2:** The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits the accounts of the Union and states.  The Election Commission, not the CAG, conducts elections.

* **Pair 3:** The President appoints civil servants, usually on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Election Commission is not involved in this process.



**3.  With reference to the Indian Parliamentary system, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bill                    Special Feature
    1. Money Bill                     :  Can be introduced only with President's recommendation
    2. Financial Bill                  :  Always originates in Rajya Sabha
    3. Ordinary Bill                   :  Can be introduced by a private member
    4. Constitutional Amendment Bill : Requires a special majority for passage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because:

* **Pair 1:**  A Money Bill can only be introduced in Parliament with the prior recommendation of the President. This is a crucial safeguard to ensure proper financial management and control.

* **Pair 3:** Ordinary Bills can be introduced by any member of Parliament, whether a minister or a private member.  This allows for a wider range of legislative proposals.

* **Pair 4:**  A Constitutional Amendment Bill requires a special majority for passage in both houses of Parliament. This reflects the importance of amendments to the fundamental law of the land.

Pairs 2 is incorrect:  Financial Bills, while dealing with finances, always originate in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article          Related Body/Power
    1. Article 148                     :  Election Commission
    2. Article 76                      :  Attorney General of India
    3. Article 149                     :  Comptroller and Auditor General of India
    4. Article 324                    : Union Public Service Commission
    5. Article 52                      : President of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched:


* **Pair 2:** Article 76 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Attorney General of India, outlining their appointment, responsibilities, and tenure.

* **Pair 3:** Article 149 of the Constitution pertains to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), detailing their duties and powers.

* **Pair 5:** Article 52 of the Constitution defines the office of the President of India.


The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** Article 148 deals with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, not the Election Commission.

* **Pair 4:** Article 324 deals with the Election Commission, not the Union Public Service Commission.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Legislative Body              Compositional Feature
    1. Lok Sabha                     :  One-third members retire every two years.
    2. Rajya Sabha                    :  Represents states based on population.
    3. State Legislative Assembly    :  Nominated members by the Governor.
    4. State Legislative Council     :  Direct election of some members.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 2:** The Rajya Sabha, or Council of States, represents the states of India, with the number of seats allocated to each state based on its population. This ensures regional representation in the upper house of Parliament.

* **Pair 4:**  While some members of State Legislative Councils are nominated by the Governor, a significant portion of members are directly elected, often through a system of proportional representation.


The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** The Lok Sabha, or House of the People, is not a continuing body; it is dissolved after a five-year term.  The Rajya Sabha, with one-third of its members retiring every two years, is the continuing chamber.

* **Pair 3:** State Legislative Assemblies primarily comprise directly elected members. The Governor's nominated members are a small minority.


These questions test factual recall and analytical skills, requiring candidates to accurately match constitutional bodies, articles, and their functions.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes these questions challenging and suitable for a UPSC-level examination.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Figure                     Government Body Advised
1. Attorney-General of India          :    Government of Andhra Pradesh
2. Advocate-General of Gujarat      :    Government of India
3. Solicitor-General of India         :    Government of Tamil Nadu
4. Attorney-General of India          :    Government of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Attorney-General of India is the legal advisor to the Government of India.  Option 4 correctly reflects this relationship.  Option 1 is incorrect because the Advocate-General advises the state government, not the central government.  The Advocate-General of a state is appointed by the Governor of that state to advise the state government on legal matters. Therefore, option 2 is also incorrect. Similarly, the Solicitor-General assists the Attorney-General and does not advise state governments independently. Option 3 is also incorrect. The correct pairing is only between the Attorney-General of India and the Government of India (option 4).  The other options present plausible distractors by mixing up the roles of the Attorney-General, Advocate-General, and Solicitor-General, and incorrectly associating them with different levels of government.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                          Political Role Held
1. Rabi Ray                        :    Rajya Sabha Chairman
2. Shivraj Patil                    :    Lok Sabha Speaker
3. Sumitra Mahajan                  :    Lok Sabha Speaker
4. Hamid Ansari                     :    Vice President of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Shivraj Patil and Sumitra Mahajan both served as Lok Sabha Speakers.  Options 2 and 3 correctly reflect this. Option 1 is incorrect; Rabi Ray was a Lok Sabha member and held other positions but never served as Rajya Sabha Chairman.  The Vice President is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, but Hamid Ansari’s role as Vice President does not directly equate to him being the Rajya Sabha Chairman. Thus, option 4 is also incorrect.  The question uses plausible distractors, including a prominent political figure (Hamid Ansari) and a position closely associated with the correct answer (Rajya Sabha Chairman).  The correct answer highlights the understanding of the distinct roles of Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairman.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   President of India                Action/Power
1.  Pranab Mukherjee               :   Dissolved the 15th Lok Sabha
2.  A.P.J. Abdul Kalam             :   Appointed Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister
3.  Ram Nath Kovind                :   Promulgated the National Food Security Ordinance
4.  Pratibha Patil                  :   Impeached by Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Pranab Mukherjee, during his presidency, dissolved the 15th Lok Sabha. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam appointed Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister. Ram Nath Kovind, during his presidency, did not promulgate any such ordinance.  The power to promulgate ordinances rests with the President, but it doesn't automatically mean every President did so. Pratibha Patil was not impeached. The impeachment process is a complex procedure involving both houses of Parliament and requires a two-thirds majority. The question tests the understanding of the President’s powers (dissolution, appointment of PM) while using distractors like an incorrect action (impeachment) and a plausible but incorrect association of a specific ordinance with a particular president (option 3).


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Article                   Subject Matter
1. Article 53                     :   Appointment of the Vice-President
2. Article 61                     :   Procedure for removal of the President
3. Article 74                     :   Council of Ministers
4. Article 123                    :   Ordinance-making power of the President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 61 correctly details the impeachment process for the President's removal. Article 123 correctly outlines the President's power to promulgate ordinances during parliamentary recesses.  Option 1 is incorrect as Article 53 deals with the executive power of the Union, not the appointment of the Vice-President (that's Article 66).  Article 74 relates to the Council of Ministers, but doesn't detail the specific composition or functioning. The question aims to test the knowledge of specific articles and their precise content, using distractors that are close in subject matter but not exactly correct.  The correct pairings demonstrate a clear understanding of the constitutional provisions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Figure                     Role/Function
1. Attorney-General of India       :   Legal advisor to a State Government
2. Advocate-General of a State   :   Legal advisor to the Government of India
3. Solicitor-General of India      :   Represents the Government in Supreme Court
4. Chief Justice of India          :   Presides over the Rajya Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Solicitor-General of India represents the Government of India in the Supreme Court. This is the correct pairing in Option 3.  The Attorney-General advises the central government, not state governments (Option 1 is incorrect).  The Advocate-General advises the state government, not the central government (Option 2 is incorrect).  The Vice-President, not the Chief Justice of India, presides over the Rajya Sabha (Option 4 is incorrect).  The question uses plausible but incorrect pairings to test the candidate's understanding of the specific roles and functions of key legal figures in the Indian governmental structure. The correct answer demonstrates precise knowledge of the Solicitor-General's role.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister of India           Action/Policy
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                 :   Launched the Green Revolution
2. Indira Gandhi                    :   Introduced the Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG) policy
3. P.V. Narasimha Rao              :   Nationalization of Banks
4. Atal Bihari Vajpayee             :   Implementation of the Five-Year Plans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru is correctly associated with the launch of the Green Revolution during his tenure as Prime Minister. P.V. Narasimha Rao is correctly linked to the nationalization of banks. Indira Gandhi introduced the Nationalization of Banks policy, not the LPG policy; that was introduced by P.V. Narasimha Rao.  Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not implement the Five-Year Plans directly.  The Five-Year Plans were a continuous process involving multiple Prime Ministers and government bodies. The question tests specific policy implementations by Prime Ministers, using distractors that are related to the era or the general economic policies of the time. The correct answer shows a precise understanding of historical economic policies.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Title Held
1.  V.V. Giri                   :   Chief Justice of India
2.  N. Sanjiva Reddy            :   President of India
3.  K.R. Narayanan              :   Prime Minister of India
4.  Zakir Hussain                :   President of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

N. Sanjiva Reddy and Zakir Hussain both served as Presidents of India. Options 2 and 4 correctly reflect this. V.V. Giri was not a Chief Justice of India; he served as President. K.R. Narayanan was not a Prime Minister; he served as President.  The question effectively uses distractors like associating prominent figures with incorrect titles and using plausible but incorrect high-profile positions (Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister) to test the candidate's precise knowledge of individuals and their official roles.  The correct answer shows a clear understanding of the Indian Presidency.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vice-President of India        Mode of Removal
1.  M. Hamid Ansari              :   Impeachment by Parliament
2.  Bhairon Singh Shekhawat       :   Resolution of Lok Sabha
3.  Venkaiah Naidu                :   Resolution of Rajya Sabha
4.  Jagdeep Dhankhar              :   Impeachment by Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Vice-President of India is removed by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha. Option 3 correctly states this.  The other options are incorrect as they incorrectly state the method of removal; the Vice President is not removed by impeachment (options 1 and 4) or by a resolution of the Lok Sabha (option 2). The question uses distractors to test the candidate's knowledge of the precise constitutional process for removing the Vice-President.  The correct answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Rajya Sabha’s role in this process.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Political Figure              Electoral College
1. President of India             :   Members of both Houses of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies
2. Vice-President of India        :   Only elected members of both Houses of Parliament
3. Lok Sabha Speaker              :   Elected members of Lok Sabha
4. Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman  :   Elected members of Rajya Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha Speaker is elected by the elected members of the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman is elected by the elected members of the Rajya Sabha.  Options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The President of India is elected by an electoral college comprising elected members of both Houses of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies (Option 1 is incorrect). The Vice-President is elected by the members of an electoral college comprising elected members of both Houses of Parliament (Option 2 is incorrect). The question tests the intricate details of the electoral colleges for various high offices, using subtle distractors to differentiate between the composition of electoral colleges for different positions. The correct answer demonstrates a precise knowledge of the electoral processes in India.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about Prime Minister      Truth Value
1.  Is the nominal head of the Council of Ministers:  True
2.  Is not responsible to Parliament:                False
3.  Cannot dismiss any of his ministers:              False
4. Is the real head of the Council of Ministers:       True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prime Minister is the real head of the Council of Ministers, and the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Parliament.  Therefore, statements 1 and 4 are correctly matched. The Prime Minister is responsible to the Parliament and can dismiss ministers from his council. Statements 2 and 3 are therefore incorrect. The question uses subtle distractors related to the Prime Minister's role and power to test the candidate's nuanced understanding of the parliamentary system.  The correct answer demonstrates a precise understanding of the Prime Minister’s position within the Council of Ministers and their relationship with the Parliament.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister             Associated Event/Action
1. Jawaharlal Nehru          :   First Five-Year Plan
2. Lal Bahadur Shastri       :   Tashkent Agreement
3. Indira Gandhi             :   Nationalization of Banks
4. Morarji Desai             :   Nuclear Test
5. Rajiv Gandhi              :   Panchayati Raj Institution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru's tenure as Prime Minister saw the launch of the First Five-Year Plan, focusing on agriculture and rural development. This was a landmark initiative in India's post-independence economic planning.  Lal Bahadur Shastri played a crucial role in the Tashkent Agreement, a peace treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1966, ending the 1965 war. This demonstrated his diplomatic skills and commitment to regional peace. Indira Gandhi's government nationalized 14 major commercial banks in 1969, a significant step towards socialist policies aimed at controlling the financial sector and extending credit to rural areas.  The other options incorrectly link Prime Ministers with events that occurred during the tenures of other leaders.  Morarji Desai was not associated with the nuclear tests; those occurred under Indira Gandhi. Similarly, the significant expansion of the Panchayati Raj system happened under the tenure of Indira Gandhi, not Rajiv Gandhi, although Rajiv Gandhi did implement some reforms within the system. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the correct association between the Prime Minister and a significant event or action during their respective terms.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Position Held
1. Gulzari Lal Nanda           :   Prime Minister of India
2. Charan Singh               :   Deputy Prime Minister of India
3. Deve Gowda                 :   President of India
4. Manmohan Singh             :   Finance Minister of India
5. V.P. Singh                  :   Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Gulzari Lal Nanda served twice as interim Prime Minister of India.  Charan Singh served as the Deputy Prime Minister under Morarji Desai's government. Manmohan Singh held the post of Finance Minister before becoming Prime Minister. The other options present incorrect pairings. Deve Gowda never held the office of President; he was Prime Minister. V.P. Singh was never the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh; he served as Prime Minister and Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. The correct answer includes only those pairs where the individual held the stated position.  This highlights the importance of accurate factual recall in understanding Indian political history and leadership roles.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister             Key Policy Initiative
1. Indira Gandhi              :   Green Revolution
2. Rajiv Gandhi              :   National Policy on Education (1986)
3. P.V. Narasimha Rao        :   Economic Liberalization
4. A.B. Vajpayee              :   Golden Quadrilateral Highway Project
5. Narendra Modi             :   Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

Indira Gandhi's government significantly accelerated the Green Revolution through the adoption of high-yielding variety seeds and increased irrigation facilities. This led to a substantial increase in food grain production. Rajiv Gandhi's administration introduced the National Policy on Education (1986), aiming to improve the quality and accessibility of education in India. P.V. Narasimha Rao's government initiated economic liberalization, which involved significant deregulation, privatization, and opening up the Indian economy to global markets. A.B. Vajpayee's government launched the Golden Quadrilateral Highway Project, a massive infrastructure undertaking connecting major cities.  Narendra Modi's government launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a nationwide cleanliness campaign.  All the pairs correctly match the Prime Minister with their notable policy initiatives.  This question tests the understanding of major policy changes during different Prime Ministerial tenures and their long-term impact on Indian society and economy.


**4. With reference to Indian Prime Ministers, consider the following pairs:**

   Prime Minister             Political Party
1. Lal Bahadur Shastri       :   Bharatiya Janata Party
2. Morarji Desai             :   Indian National Congress
3. Chandrasekhar             :   Janata Dal
4. I.K. Gujral                :   Janata Party
5. Atal Bihari Vajpayee      :   Bharatiya Janata Party

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Chandrasekhar led a Janata Dal government. I.K. Gujral led a Janata Dal government. Atal Bihari Vajpayee led several Bharatiya Janata Party governments. The other options contain incorrect pairings.  Lal Bahadur Shastri was associated with the Indian National Congress, not the Bharatiya Janata Party. Morarji Desai also belonged to the Indian National Congress before forming the Janata Party.  This question highlights the changing political landscape of India and the role of different political parties in forming governments. Accurate knowledge of the political affiliations of Prime Ministers is crucial for understanding India's political history.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   President of India          Significant Event During Tenure
1. Dr. Rajendra Prasad        :   Adoption of the Constitution
2. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan  :   Indo-China War
3. Zakir Husain               :   Green Revolution
4. V.V. Giri                  :   Emergency Proclamation (1975)
5. Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed       :   Operation Blue Star

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Dr. Rajendra Prasad served as President during the adoption of the Indian Constitution in 1950, a pivotal moment in Indian history. Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed was President during the declaration of the Emergency in 1975 and the subsequent Operation Blue Star.  The other options misrepresent the events during the Presidents' tenures. The Indo-China war happened before Radhakrishnan's presidency. The Green Revolution primarily unfolded during Indira Gandhi's Prime Ministership, not Zakir Husain's presidency.  V.V. Giri's presidency did not coincide with the Emergency.  This question necessitates precise knowledge of Indian history and the timelines of significant events, testing the candidate's ability to accurately connect Presidents with events during their term.  Only options 1 and 5 represent accurate connections.


**6.  With reference to the Indian President, consider the following pairs:**

   Power/Function                         Article of the Constitution
1.  Impeachment of the President          :   Article 61
2.  Election of the President              :   Article 54
3.  Powers of the President during Emergency:    Article 356
4.  Council of Ministers' advice           :   Article 74
5.  Ordinance-making power                :   Article 123


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 61 outlines the process for the impeachment of the President. Article 54 details the manner of election of the President. Article 74 deals with the President acting on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Article 123 grants the President the power to promulgate ordinances.  Option (a) is correct because these pairs correctly link the presidential power or function with the relevant constitutional article. Option 3 is incorrect as Article 356 deals with the President's power to impose President's rule in a state, not the President's powers during a general emergency (which is covered under Article 352). This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian Constitution, specifically the articles governing the powers and functions of the President. The ability to accurately match functions with the relevant articles demonstrates a strong understanding of the constitutional framework.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                  Chairman Appointed By
1. Union Public Service Commission    :   Prime Minister
2. Finance Commission                  :   President
3. National Human Rights Commission :   Speaker of Lok Sabha
4. Election Commission                 :   President
5. Comptroller and Auditor General      :   President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Chairman of the Finance Commission is appointed by the President of India.  The Election Commission's Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India is appointed by the President.  The other options present incorrect information. The Chairman of the UPSC is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister. The Chairperson of the NHRC is appointed by the President, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the constitutional bodies in India and the process of appointment of their Chairpersons.  Only options 2, 4, and 5 correctly match the Constitutional Body with the appointing authority.


**8. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Schedule                        Subject Matter
1. First Schedule                  :   States and their territories
2. Second Schedule                :   Salaries and allowances of the President
3. Third Schedule                 :   Forms of Oaths or Affirmations
4. Fourth Schedule                 :   Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha
5. Fifth Schedule                  :   Administration of Scheduled Areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

The First Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists the states and their territories. The Second Schedule specifies the salaries and allowances of the President, Governors, and other high officials. The Third Schedule outlines the forms of oaths or affirmations to be taken by various constitutional functionaries. The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha. The Fifth Schedule addresses the administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes. All pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the Indian Constitution's organizational structure as outlined in its schedules.  This question assesses the candidate's detailed knowledge of the Indian Constitution's organizational structure and the information contained within its schedules.  The ability to recall and match the schedules with their respective subject matters is critical.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Amendment Act       Provision/Feature
1. First Amendment Act, 1951       :    Added Fundamental Duties
2. Fourth Amendment Act, 1955       :    Added the concept of "basic structure" of the Constitution
3. Seventeenth Amendment Act, 1964  :    Included certain land reforms laws in the Ninth Schedule
4. Twenty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1971:   Curtailed the right to property
5. Forty-Second Amendment Act, 1976:   Added the word "socialist" to the Preamble

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Seventeenth Amendment Act, 1964, aimed to protect land reforms legislations by including them in the Ninth Schedule. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1971, significantly altered the right to property by removing it from the list of Fundamental Rights. The Forty-Second Amendment Act, 1976, added the words "socialist", "secular", and "integrity" to the Preamble. Options 1 and 2 are incorrect. The First Amendment Act did not add Fundamental Duties (that was done by the 42nd Amendment). The concept of the "basic structure" of the Constitution was not added by any amendment; it was established through Supreme Court judgments. This question tests knowledge of important constitutional amendments and their impact. Correctly identifying the matched pairs demonstrates a strong understanding of the evolution of the Indian Constitution.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Right                                 Article
1. Right to Equality                     :   Article 19
2. Right to Freedom of Religion         :   Article 25
3. Right against Exploitation            :   Article 23
4. Right to Constitutional Remedies     :   Article 32
5. Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression: Article 14

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 25 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion. Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies.  The other options are incorrect. Article 14 deals with the right to equality, not Article 19 which deals with the right to freedom. Article 19 deals with six freedoms: freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution and their corresponding articles.  Accurate matching of rights with articles demonstrates a thorough understanding of the constitutional provisions. Only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                  Action/Power
1. President of India                 :  Appoints the Chief Justice of India
2. President of India                 :  Dissolves the Rajya Sabha
3. President of India                 :  Introduces Money Bills in Parliament
4. President of India                 :  Commands the Armed Forces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India  as per the Constitution.  This is a key constitutional power related to the judiciary.  The President, as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, holds the ultimate authority over the Indian military. This is explicitly stated in the Constitution.  Option 3 is incorrect because the President does not introduce Money Bills; they are introduced in the Lok Sabha. The President's role is to give assent to Money Bills passed by Parliament, or to withhold or return them for reconsideration. Option 2 is also incorrect, as the President can dissolve the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body; it is not subject to dissolution.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 accurately reflect the President's constitutional powers and roles.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the President's executive and military powers.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article            Presidential Power/Function
1. Article 72                         :  Grants pardons to convicts in state cases
2. Article 143                        :  Seeks advisory opinion from the Supreme Court
3. Article 356                        :  Appoints the Prime Minister
4. Article 360                        :  Proclaims a National Emergency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Article 143 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court on any question of law or fact. This is a crucial aspect of the President's interaction with the judiciary, allowing for clarification on complex legal issues. Option 1 is incorrect because Article 72 deals with the President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, remissions, and commutations of punishment for offenses against Union laws, not state laws.  Option 3 is incorrect as Article 356 deals with the President's Rule, not the appointment of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President after the latter consults with the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha.  Option 4 is incorrect; Article 360 deals with the proclamation of a Financial Emergency, not a National Emergency. A National Emergency is proclaimed under Article 352. The other options are incorrect due to the mismatching of constitutional articles with the President's functions. The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills concerning the President's powers.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   President of India's Power/Function   Type of Veto
1. Withholding assent to a Money Bill  :  Absolute Veto
2. Returning a non-Money Bill for reconsideration : Suspensive Veto
3. Taking no action on a Bill             :  Pocket Veto

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The President's power to return a non-Money Bill to Parliament for reconsideration is a suspensive veto because Parliament can override the President's decision by repassing the bill. The President's inaction on a bill, leading to its lapse, constitutes a pocket veto.  Option 1 is incorrect because the President does not possess an absolute veto over Money Bills. While the President can withhold assent to ordinary bills,  Money Bills are different.  If a Money Bill is passed by Parliament, the President must give assent within a specific time frame.  The President's power is limited in this case. Other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the types of veto powers available to the President concerning different bills. The question assesses conceptual understanding of the President's veto powers and their classifications.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Person                                    Power/Function related to the President
1. Parliament                                    :  Initiates the impeachment of the President
2. Lok Sabha                                     :  Decides on the disqualification of a President
3. Supreme Court                               :  Advises the President on questions of law
4. Rajya Sabha                                   :  Nominates 12 members to Rajya Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Parliament has the sole power to initiate the impeachment of the President.  The Supreme Court can advise the President on questions of law, but this advice is not binding. Option 2 is incorrect because the Election Commission, not the Lok Sabha, decides on the disqualification of a President. The Lok Sabha's role is primarily in the impeachment process. Option 4 is incorrect because the President, not the Rajya Sabha, nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha itself plays a role in the impeachment process but does not nominate members. The question tests the understanding of the checks and balances on the President's power, and the distribution of powers among different constitutional bodies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   President of India's Action            Constitutional Article
1.  Promulgation of Ordinances           :  Article 356
2.  Proclamation of Financial Emergency :  Article 360
3.  Appointment of Governors             :  Article 153
4.  Dissolution of Lok Sabha             :  Article 85


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 360 of the Constitution deals with the President's power to proclaim a Financial Emergency.  Article 153 deals with the appointment of Governors by the President. Article 85 deals with the President's power to dissolve the Lok Sabha. Option 1 is incorrect because Article 356 relates to the President's Rule, not the power to promulgate ordinances.  The President's power to issue ordinances is covered under Article 123. The other incorrect options fail to accurately pair the President's actions with the relevant constitutional articles. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the specific constitutional provisions related to the President's powers.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Type of Bill                                     Presidential Action
1. Money Bill                                      :   Return for reconsideration
2. Ordinary Bill                                   :   Withhold assent
3. Financial Bill (not solely a Money Bill)      :   Give assent

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The President can withhold assent to an ordinary bill, effectively vetoing it.  The President must give assent to a Financial Bill (that is not solely a Money Bill) once it has been passed by both houses of Parliament.  A Money Bill cannot be returned for reconsideration; the President must give assent.  The President can only withhold assent or give assent, not return it for reconsideration. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of the nuances of the President's powers regarding different types of bills and the limitations placed on those powers.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Office              Function Related to the President
1.  Union Public Service Commission     :   Advises on the appointment of Governors
2.  Election Commission                  :   Decides on Presidential election disputes
3.  Supreme Court                         :   Impeaches the President
4.  Parliament                             :   Appoints the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) advises the President on various appointments, including those of Governors. The Election Commission resolves disputes concerning Presidential elections. Option 3 is incorrect; Parliament initiates the impeachment of the President, not the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court adjudicates on election disputes. Option 4 is incorrect because the President is indirectly elected by an Electoral College comprising members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies, not directly appointed by Parliament. The other options are incorrect because of the mismatching of constitutional bodies and their functions related to the President.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles of different constitutional bodies in the context of the President's office.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Power of the President                    Type of Veto
1.  Returning a Bill for reconsideration    :  Absolute Veto
2.  Withholding assent to a Bill           :  Suspensive Veto
3.  Taking no action on a Bill              :  Pocket Veto

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The President's inaction on a bill, causing it to lapse, is known as a pocket veto.  Option 1 is incorrect because returning a bill for reconsideration is a suspensive veto, not an absolute veto. An absolute veto is when the President withholds assent, and the bill is permanently rejected. Option 2 is incorrect as withholding assent to a bill is an absolute veto, not a suspensive veto. A suspensive veto allows Parliament to override the President's decision by repassing the bill.  This question tests the understanding of different types of veto powers and their accurate classification in the Indian context.  The subtle differences between these veto types are crucial for understanding the balance of power within the Indian political system.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   President's Power/Function                  Related Constitutional Article
1.  Granting Pardons                        :   Article 352
2.  Appointing Judges of High Courts      :   Article 124
3.  Addressing Joint Sittings of Parliament :   Article 85
4.  Proclaiming National Emergency           :   Article 72


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only


**Explanation:**

The President appoints judges of High Courts under Article 124. The President addresses joint sittings of Parliament under Article 85. Option 1 is incorrect because Article 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency, not the power to grant pardons. The President's pardoning power is described in Article 72. Option 4 is incorrect because Article 72 deals with the President's power to grant pardons, not the proclamation of a National Emergency.  A national emergency is proclaimed under Article 352. The other options incorrectly pair the President's powers with the constitutional articles. The question tests factual knowledge of the specific articles related to the President's powers and functions.  It highlights the importance of precise understanding of constitutional provisions.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Provision                Presidential Power/Function
1. Article 111                             :   Nominates members to Rajya Sabha
2. Article 123                             :   Promulgates Ordinances
3. Article 352                             :   Dissolves the Lok Sabha
4. Article 153                             : Appoints the Governors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 123 grants the President the power to promulgate ordinances during periods when Parliament is not in session. Article 153 deals with the President's power to appoint the Governors of States. Option 1 is incorrect because Article 111 deals with the President's assent to Bills passed by Parliament, not the nomination of Rajya Sabha members. The President nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha under a different constitutional provision.  Option 3 is incorrect as Article 352 relates to the proclamation of a National Emergency, not the dissolution of the Lok Sabha; the President dissolves the Lok Sabha under Article 85. The other options incorrectly match constitutional provisions with Presidential functions.  The question tests precise knowledge of the articles that define the President's powers and responsibilities.  The distractors aim to test the depth of understanding of the examinee's knowledge of the President's powers.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Subject Matter
1. Article 63                     :   Election of the President
2. Article 64                     :   Vice-President's ex-officio Chairmanship of Rajya Sabha
3. Article 65                     :   Removal of the Vice-President
4. Article 66                     :   Procedure for the Election of the Vice-President
5. Article 71                     :   Election Disputes related to the President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 63 of the Indian Constitution deals with the office of the Vice-President, including its existence.  Article 64 explicitly states that the Vice-President shall be the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). Article 66 outlines the detailed procedure for the election of the Vice-President.  Article 71 addresses the resolution of any disputes that may arise during the election of the President or Vice-President, entrusting the final decision to the Supreme Court.  Article 65 concerns the Vice-President's role in acting as President, not the removal process. The removal of the Vice-President is covered under a different article. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (d) accurately reflects this.  Option (a) is incorrect as Article 63 does not cover the election of the President; that is covered by other articles. Options (b) and (c) incorrectly include Article 65 and/or Article 63.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Vice-President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha (pair 2 is correct). The President of India appoints the Prime Minister, adhering to established conventions (pair 3 is correct).  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Vice-President does not serve as Speaker of the Lok Sabha.  Pair 4 is incorrect; the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, not the Head of State. The President is the Head of State (pair 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) is the correct answer. The other options incorrectly include pairings that are factually inaccurate regarding the roles and functions of these key constitutional positions.

2. Election Commission of India :   Conducts Elections for the Vice-President
3. Supreme Court                 :   Decides disputes related to Presidential elections
4. Parliament                    :   Determines the salary of the President
5. Union Council of Ministers    :   Appoints the Chief Justice of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) conducts elections for the Vice-President of India (pair 2 is correct). The Supreme Court of India has the power to adjudicate disputes arising from Presidential elections (pair 3 is correct). Parliament is responsible for determining the salary and allowances of the President (pair 4 is correct).  Pair 1 is incorrect; the President, not the ECI, appoints Governors. Pair 5 is incorrect; the President appoints the Chief Justice of India.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (d) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly include pairs that are factually inaccurate concerning the powers and functions of these constitutional bodies.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure          Specific Power/Duty

4. Vice-President              :   Presides over joint sessions of Parliament
5. Speaker of Lok Sabha       :   Appoints Ministers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the Governor of a state (pair 2 is correct). The Governor of a state can recommend the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly to the President (pair 3 is correct). Pair 1 is incorrect; only the President can dissolve the Rajya Sabha. Pair 4 is incorrect; the Vice-President does not preside over joint sessions of Parliament; the President does. Pair 5 is incorrect; the Prime Minister recommends the appointment of ministers, and the President formally appoints them. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) is the correct answer. The other options include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of the powers and responsibilities of these key figures within the Indian political system.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Position       Specific Characteristic
1. President                    :   Elected by an Electoral College for a six-year term

3. Governor                     :   Appointed by the Prime Minister for a five-year term
4. Prime Minister                :   Head of the Council of Ministers
5. Speaker of Lok Sabha          :   Removed by impeachment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prime Minister is indeed the head of the Council of Ministers (pair 4 is correct).  The other pairs are incorrect. The President is elected by an Electoral College for a five-year term, not six (pair 1 is incorrect). The Vice-President is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, not the Lok Sabha (pair 2 is incorrect). The Governor is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister, and also serves a five-year term (pair 3 is incorrect). The Speaker of the Lok Sabha can be removed by a resolution of the Lok Sabha, not by impeachment (pair 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. Option (c) is the correct answer.  The incorrect options demonstrate a misunderstanding of the precise details of the constitutional positions and their selection/removal processes.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of a state appoints the Chief Minister (pair 2 is correct).  The Prime Minister recommends the dissolution of the Lok Sabha to the President (pair 3 is correct).  The other pairs are incorrect. The President dissolves the Lok Sabha, not the Governor (pair 1 is incorrect). The Speaker of the Lok Sabha presides over the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha (pair 4 is incorrect). The Election Commission of India does not set election schedules for state assemblies; the Election Commission of India conducts elections for State Assemblies but the schedule is decided by the state government (pair 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (b) is the correct answer. The other options incorrectly pair individuals/bodies with powers or responsibilities that they do not possess, highlighting potential areas of confusion regarding the Indian political system.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article       Specific Provision
1. Article 153                   :   Establishment of High Courts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 154 of the Indian Constitution deals with the executive power of the state, vesting it in the Governor (pair 2 is correct). Article 161 outlines the Governor's pardoning power (pair 3 is correct). Article 200 describes the Governor's power to reserve certain bills for the President's consideration (pair 4 is correct). Article 213 grants the Governor the power to promulgate ordinances when the state legislature is not in session (pair 5 is correct). Pair 1 is incorrect; Article 153 deals with the Governor, not the establishment of High Courts.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (d) is the correct choice. The other options demonstrate a lack of detailed understanding of the specific provisions of the Indian Constitution relating to the Governor's powers and functions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) participates in the election of the Vice-President (pair 2 is correct). Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha together) has the power to impeach the President (pair 3 is correct). The Supreme Court decides election-related disputes, including those concerning the Vice-President (pair 4 is correct). The Council of Ministers advises the Governor on matters of state administration (pair 5 is correct). Pair 1 is incorrect; the Electoral College, which includes the Lok Sabha, elects the President, but the Lok Sabha alone does not. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (d) is the accurate answer. The other options fail to capture the complete picture of the roles and responsibilities of these governmental bodies within the Indian constitutional framework.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 5 only

(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Vice-President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha (pair 5 is correct). The other pairs are incorrect. The President is the Head of State, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government (pair 1 is incorrect). The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, not the Lok Sabha (pair 2 is incorrect). The Governor is appointed for a five-year term, not six (pair 3 is incorrect). The Speaker of Lok Sabha is a member of the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha (pair 4 is incorrect). Therefore, only pair 5 is correctly matched. Option (b) is the correct answer.  Incorrect options reflect a lack of precise knowledge about the roles and characteristics of key figures in the Indian political system.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act  Specific Provision/Impact
1. 11th Amendment Act           :   Altered the procedure for electing the President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act made the Prime Minister's advice binding on the President in most matters (pair 2 is correct). The 44th Amendment Act restored the original five-year term for the Lok Sabha (pair 3 is correct). The 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts established Panchayati Raj institutions and Urban Local Governments, respectively (pairs 4 and 5 are correct).  Pair 1 is incorrect; the 11th Amendment Act altered the procedure for electing the Vice-President, not the President.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (c) is the correct answer. The other options demonstrate a lack of accurate knowledge about the specific effects of particular constitutional amendment acts on the Indian political system.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   House of Parliament                  Key Feature
1. Lok Sabha                             :   Elected directly by the people
2. Rajya Sabha                            :   Represents States and Union Territories
3. Parliament                             :   Composed of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
4. Lok Sabha                              :   Can initiate impeachment proceedings against the President
5. Rajya Sabha                            :   Can delay but not reject Money Bills

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched. The Lok Sabha is the lower house of the Indian Parliament, directly elected by the people. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, represents the states and union territories. The Parliament, the supreme legislative body, is constituted by both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.  The Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in initiating impeachment proceedings against the President.  Finally, while the Rajya Sabha can consider and amend Money Bills, it cannot ultimately reject them; the Lok Sabha's power in this regard is paramount.  These are fundamental aspects of India's parliamentary system and are well-established constitutional facts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Primary Function
1. Election Commission of India          :   Conducts elections for the President
2. Union Public Service Commission      :   Appoints judges to the Supreme Court
3. Comptroller and Auditor General       :   Audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments
4. National Human Rights Commission     :   Investigates human rights violations
5. Finance Commission                     :   Recommends distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for conducting elections to the President of India, along with other legislative bodies. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits the accounts of the Union and State governments, ensuring financial accountability. The Finance Commission is tasked with recommending the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and State governments, playing a vital role in fiscal federalism.  However, the Supreme Court appoints its own judges, not the UPSC. While the NHRC investigates human rights violations, it is not a constitutional body in the same way as the ECI, CAG, or Finance Commission.  The correct matching of only the ECI, CAG, and Finance Commission highlights the distinct constitutional mandates and functions of these crucial institutions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                        Significant Impact on the Indian Polity
1. 42nd Amendment Act                  :   Introduction of Fundamental Duties
2. 44th Amendment Act                  :   Restoration of the original position of Article 356
3. 73rd Amendment Act                  :   Establishment of Panchayats
4. 74th Amendment Act                  :   Establishment of Municipalities
5. 87th Amendment Act                  :   Reduction of voting age from 21 to 18

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 introduced Fundamental Duties into the Constitution. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 established the Panchayati Raj system, providing constitutional status to local self-governance. The 74th Amendment Act of 1992 similarly established Municipalities, creating a three-tiered urban local governance structure. The 87th Amendment Act of 1996 reduced the voting age from 21 to 18 years. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 did not restore the original position of Article 356 but rather sought to limit its scope to prevent its misuse.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, demonstrating the significant constitutional changes introduced by these amendments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure                     Significant Role/Position
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                     :   First Prime Minister of India
2. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel              :   First Home Minister of India
3. B.R. Ambedkar                        :   Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly
4. Rajendra Prasad                       :   First President of India
5. Mahatma Gandhi                       :   Member of the Constituent Assembly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Jawaharlal Nehru served as the first Prime Minister of India, playing a pivotal role in shaping the nation's post-independence trajectory. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was India's first Home Minister, instrumental in the integration of princely states into the Indian Union. B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution, chaired the Drafting Committee, which drafted the Constitution. Rajendra Prasad held the post of the first President of India.  While Mahatma Gandhi was influential in the independence movement, he did not serve as a member of the Constituent Assembly.  The accurate matching of these four pairs underscores the crucial roles these individuals played in shaping modern India.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Article                 Subject Matter
1. Article 14                             :   Right to Equality
2. Article 21                             :   Right to Freedom of Religion
3. Article 32                             :   Right to Constitutional Remedies
4. Article 356                            :   President's Rule
5. Article 360                            :   Financial Emergency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Article 14 guarantees the Right to Equality before the law and equal protection of the laws.  Article 32 guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies, enabling citizens to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights.  Article 356 deals with the imposition of President's Rule in a state, a significant power related to federal relations. Article 360 allows the declaration of a Financial Emergency. However, Article 21 is related to the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, and not Freedom of Religion, which is covered under Article 25.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, signifying the key provisions of the Indian Constitution.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Judgement              Landmark Constitutional Issue
1. Kesavananda Bharati Case             :   Basic Structure Doctrine
2. Golak Nath Case                       :   Amendment of Fundamental Rights
3. Minerva Mills Case                    :   Balance of Power between Legislature and Judiciary
4. S.R. Bommai Case                      :   Definition of Secularism
5. I.R. Coelho Case                      :   Judicial Review of Ninth Schedule entries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati case established the "basic structure doctrine," which limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. The Golak Nath case dealt with the Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights. The Minerva Mills case defined the limits of the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution and the balance of power between the legislature and judiciary. However, the S.R. Bommai case dealt with the definition of secularism and the limits on the misuse of Article 356. The I.R. Coelho case concerned the judicial review of entries in the Ninth Schedule, not necessarily the definition of secularism.  Only the first three pairs are accurately matched, demonstrating the impact of these landmark Supreme Court judgements on the Indian Constitution.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Institution                 Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                            :   Passes the Budget
2. Rajya Sabha                           :   Elects the Vice President
3. President                             :   Appoints the Prime Minister
4. Supreme Court                        :   Judicial Review
5. Election Commission                   :   Conducts elections to state assemblies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament, holds the primary responsibility for passing the Union Budget. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, elects the Vice President of India. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who then forms the government. The Supreme Court exercises the power of judicial review, ensuring the constitutionality of laws and government actions.  The Election Commission conducts elections to the State Legislative Assemblies, playing a critical role in the democratic process.  The perfect matching of all pairs reflects the key functions and powers of these central institutions within the Indian political system.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    State                               First Woman Chief Minister
1. Uttar Pradesh                        :   Sucheta Kripalani
2. Tamil Nadu                           :   Jayalalitha
3. Andhra Pradesh                       :   Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy
4. Bihar                                 :   Rabri Devi
5. Kerala                                :   K.R. Gowri Amma


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Sucheta Kripalani was the first woman Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Rabri Devi was the first woman Chief Minister of Bihar. K.R. Gowri Amma was the first woman Chief Minister of Kerala. However, Jayalalitha was not the first woman Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu; that distinction belongs to C.N. Annadurai.  Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy was a Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, but not the first woman Chief Minister.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, demonstrating the historical significance of these women in Indian politics.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Governor's Power                     Constitutional Provision
1. Appointment of the Chief Minister   :   Article 164
2. Dissolution of the State Assembly  :   Article 174
3. Recommendation for President's Rule :   Article 356
4. Withholding assent to a Bill        :   Article 200
5.  Granting pardons                     : Article 72


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Governor appoints the Chief Minister as per Article 164.  The Governor recommends the imposition of President's rule under Article 356. The Governor can withhold assent to a Bill passed by the State Legislature as per Article 200.  However, the Governor does not directly dissolve the State Assembly (that power rests with the President acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers) and the power of granting pardons lies with the President under Article 72, not the Governor. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, showcasing the Governor's significant but limited powers within the Indian federal structure.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept                          Associated Constitutional Article
1. Right to Equality                       :   Article 17
2. Right against Exploitation              :   Article 23
3. Right to Freedom of Religion            :   Article 25
4. Right to Constitutional Remedies       :   Article 32
5. Right to Life and Personal Liberty    :   Article 21


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour, embodying the Right against Exploitation.  Article 25 guarantees the Right to Freedom of Religion. Article 32 ensures the Right to Constitutional Remedies, allowing citizens to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Article 21 guarantees the Right to Life and Personal Liberty.  However, Article 17 deals with the abolition of untouchability, not the Right to Equality, which is covered under Article 14.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, highlighting the crucial fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Chief Minister can *recommend* the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly, but the Governor holds the actual power to dissolve it. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The Governor appoints the Advocate General (pair 2 is correct). The President nominates Anglo-Indian members to the Lok Sabha if they are not adequately represented (pair 3 is correct). The Speaker of the Lok Sabha does not preside over joint sittings; the President does (pair 4 is incorrect). The Attorney General advises the government, including the President, on legal matters (pair 5 is correct).  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Constitutional Article**       **Relates to**
1. Article 163                    :   Council of Ministers in the States
2. Article 167                    :   Functions of the Chief Minister

(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 163 deals with the aid and advice given to the Governor by the Council of Ministers (correct). Article 167 outlines the functions of the Chief Minister (correct). Article 352 pertains to the proclamation of a National Emergency, not a Financial Emergency (incorrect).  Article 239AA provides special provisions for the National Capital Territory of Delhi (incorrect, as it's related to Delhi's governance but not in the way described). Article 76 pertains to the Attorney General of India (correct). Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Indian President, consider the following pairs:**

   **Power/Function**              **Article**
1.  Dissolution of Lok Sabha       :   Article 85
2.  Appointment of Prime Minister :   Article 75
3.  Proclamation of Emergency      :   Article 352
4.  Pardon Power                   :   Article 72

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the Prime Minister (Article 75, correct). The President can proclaim a National Emergency (Article 352, correct). The President has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc. (Article 72, correct). The President possesses veto power over bills passed by Parliament (Article 111, correct). However, the President does not dissolve the Lok Sabha on their own initiative; it's done on the advice of the Prime Minister (Article 85, incorrect).  Therefore, only options (a), (c), and (d) are possible, but only (c) contains all the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Government Body**             **Head/Key Official**
1.  Council of Ministers (State)  :   Governor
2.  Rajya Sabha                   :   Deputy Chairman
3.  Lok Sabha                     :   Speaker
4.  Union Public Service Commission:   Chairman

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Sabha's head is the Chairman (Vice-President of India), not the Deputy Chairman (incorrect). The Lok Sabha is headed by the Speaker (correct). The UPSC is headed by a Chairman (correct). The Election Commission is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (correct). The Council of Ministers (State) is headed by the Chief Minister, not the Governor (incorrect).  Only option (b) accurately reflects this.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Constitutional Amendment Act**  **Key Provision**
1. 73rd Amendment Act             :   Urban Local Government Reforms
2. 74th Amendment Act             :   Panchayati Raj Institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a) Only one (5)


**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act deals with Panchayati Raj Institutions, not Urban Local Government (incorrect). The 74th Amendment Act deals with Urban Local Government, not Panchayati Raj (incorrect). The 42nd Amendment Act is associated with the Emergency provisions, not the strengthening of Fundamental Rights (incorrect).  The 44th Amendment Act primarily addressed Emergency provisions, not Fundamental Rights (incorrect).  The 87th Amendment Act introduced the Right to Education (correct).  Only one pair is correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Position                                     Person Associated
1. President of India                         :   Dr. Rajendra Prasad
2. Vice-President of India                   :   Dr. S. Radhakrishnan
3. Attorney General of India                 :   M. C. Setalvad
4. Chief Justice of India                    :   H. J. Kania
5. Prime Minister of India                   :   Jawaharlal Nehru

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Dr. Rajendra Prasad served as the first President of India.  Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan held the office of Vice-President of India. Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India.  The inclusion of M.C. Setalvad as Attorney General and H.J. Kania as Chief Justice is a distractor. While both held these positions, the question is designed to test the knowledge of the individuals associated with the highest offices during the initial years of independent India.  M.C. Setalvad served as Attorney General under Nehru, but the specific timing is not crucial to the core concept of the question. Similarly, H.J. Kania's tenure as Chief Justice overlaps with Nehru's premiership, but the precise years are irrelevant here. The question focuses on accurately pairing prominent figures with their respective high constitutional offices, emphasizing the foundational period of India's governance.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include either M.C. Setalvad or H.J. Kania or both, showcasing plausible but inaccurate associations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                       Head/Chairperson
1. Union Public Service Commission         :   Chief Election Commissioner
2. Finance Commission                       :   Prime Minister
3. National Development Council            :   President of India
4. National Human Rights Commission       :   Chief Justice of India
5. National Judicial Appointments Commission:   Attorney General of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Chief Justice of India is the Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission.  The other options are distractors.  The UPSC has a Chairperson, not the Chief Election Commissioner. The Finance Commission has a Chairperson, not the Prime Minister.  The National Development Council is chaired by the Prime Minister, not the President. The National Judicial Appointments Commission has a chairperson, not the Attorney General. The question tests the understanding of the chairpersons of various constitutional bodies,  emphasizing the importance of knowing who heads these critical institutions. The options are crafted to include plausible but incorrect associations, testing the examinee's knowledge beyond superficial recall.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                           Power/Function
1. Rajya Sabha                               :   Initiates Money Bills
2. Lok Sabha                                  :   Dissolution by the President
3. Council of Ministers                       :   Advises the Governor
4. Cabinet Secretariat                        :   Allocates financial resources to Ministries
5. Supreme Court                             :   Decides disputes between Centre and States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha can be dissolved by the President. The Council of Ministers advises the Governor. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction to decide disputes between the Centre and States.  The other options are distractors.  Money Bills are introduced in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. The Cabinet Secretariat assists the Cabinet, it doesn't allocate financial resources. The question assesses the understanding of the powers and functions of key governmental bodies, emphasizing the distribution of powers within the Indian political system.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, presenting plausible but inaccurate associations to challenge the examinee's comprehension.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                  Application/Effect
1. Article 72                               :   Pardon by the Vice-President
2. Article 356                               :   Imposition of President's Rule in a State
3. Article 111                               :   President's Veto Power
4. Article 61                               :   Impeachment of the President
5. Article 164                               :   Appointment of State Ministers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 356 deals with the imposition of President's Rule. Article 111 relates to the President's assent to Bills, encompassing the veto power. Article 61 outlines the process for the impeachment of the President.  Option (b) is incorrect because Article 72 deals with the President's pardoning power, not the Vice-President's. Article 164 pertains to the appointment of State Ministers, not the President's power. The question tests the application of specific constitutional articles to their corresponding provisions, demanding a detailed understanding of the Indian Constitution. The options are designed to include plausible but incorrect pairings, challenging the examinee's ability to differentiate between closely related constitutional provisions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                             Associated Body/Person
1. Attorney General's Opinion                :   Rajya Sabha
2. Presidential Pardoning Power             :   Supreme Court
3. Impeachment of the President             :   Lok Sabha
4. Election Disputes of the President       :   Election Commission
5.  Council of Ministers' Collective Responsibility :   President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha initiates the impeachment process of the President. The other pairings are distractors. The Attorney General advises the government, not the Rajya Sabha. The President, not the Supreme Court, holds the pardoning power. The Supreme Court, not the Election Commission, decides on Presidential election disputes. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, not the President. The question tests the understanding of the relationships between various legal concepts and the bodies or individuals involved.  The options are carefully designed to include plausible but incorrect associations, demanding a thorough understanding of the Indian political and legal system.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                             Characteristic/Function
1. Cabinet Secretariat                         :   Chairing Cabinet Committees
2. National Development Council              :   Formulating Five-Year Plans
3. Union Public Service Commission            :   Appointing District Judges
4. Comptroller and Auditor General of India   :   Auditing State Accounts
5. Attorney General of India                  :   Advising the President on Legal Matters

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The National Development Council plays a crucial role in the formulation of Five-Year Plans. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India audits the accounts of both the Union and the States. The Attorney General of India advises the government, including the President, on legal matters. The other options are distractors. The Cabinet Secretariat supports the Cabinet, it does not chair committees.  District Judges are appointed by the High Courts, not the UPSC. The question assesses the understanding of the roles and functions of various government bodies in India.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the examinee's in-depth knowledge and ability to distinguish between closely related functions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Body                            Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                                  :   Introduces Money Bills
2. Rajya Sabha                                :   Elects the Vice-President
3. State Legislative Assembly                 :   Impeaches the Governor
4. Parliament                                 :   Amends the Constitution
5.  State Legislative Council                 :   Passes Money Bills

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha has the exclusive power to introduce Money Bills. The Rajya Sabha participates in the election of the Vice-President. Parliament holds the power to amend the Constitution. The other options are distractors. Governors are not impeached by State Legislative Assemblies.  State Legislative Councils do not pass Money Bills; those are exclusively handled by the lower house (Legislative Assemblies). The question assesses the understanding of the legislative powers and functions of different legislative bodies in India. The options are designed to challenge the examinee’s understanding of the intricacies of the Indian legislative system, particularly the distinct roles of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   High Office                                 Eligibility Criterion
1. President of India                         :   Minimum age of 35 years
2. Vice-President of India                   :   Membership of Rajya Sabha
3. Governor of a State                        :   Citizen of India
4. Chief Justice of India                    :   Judge of a High Court
5. Prime Minister of India                   :   Majority support in Lok Sabha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India must be at least 35 years old. A Governor of a State must be a citizen of India. The Prime Minister needs to command a majority in the Lok Sabha to hold office. Option (b) is incorrect because eligibility for Vice-President involves qualifications for Rajya Sabha membership, not direct membership itself.  The Chief Justice of India doesn't require prior experience as a High Court judge, although it is almost always the case. The question tests the understanding of the eligibility criteria for various high offices in India. The options include plausible but incorrect criteria to challenge the examinee's knowledge and understanding of the constitutional requirements.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                        Key Function/Power
1. National Human Rights Commission          :   Recommending President's Rule
2. Union Public Service Commission            :   Conducting Civil Service Examinations
3. Finance Commission                        :   Recommending distribution of tax revenue
4. National Development Council              :   Advising on matters of foreign policy
5. Central Administrative Tribunal           :   Resolving service disputes of Central Government employees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Union Public Service Commission conducts examinations for recruitment to civil services. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and the States. The Central Administrative Tribunal resolves service matters for Central Government employees. The other options are distractors.  The National Human Rights Commission does not recommend President's Rule; that is the prerogative of the Governor. The National Development Council focuses on economic planning, not foreign policy. The question assesses the understanding of the functions of various constitutional and statutory bodies in India.  The options are designed with plausible but inaccurate functions to test the examinee’s deeper understanding and ability to distinguish between closely related functions.


**10. With reference to the Indian Parliamentary System, consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Body/Position                  Power/Function
1. Speaker of Lok Sabha                       :   Certifying Money Bills
2. Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha                 :   Presiding during the absence of Speaker
3. Chairman of Rajya Sabha                    :   Casting vote in case of a tie
4. Attorney General of India                  :   Participating in Lok Sabha debates
5. Council of Ministers                       :   Collective responsibility to Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Speaker of Lok Sabha certifies Money Bills. The Deputy Speaker presides over Lok Sabha in the Speaker's absence. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. The other options are distractors. The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha does not have a casting vote; the Deputy Chairman does.  The Attorney General can offer legal opinion but does not participate in debates. The question tests the knowledge of the powers and functions within the Indian Parliamentary system, focusing on the roles of key figures and bodies.  The incorrect options present plausible alternatives, requiring a solid understanding of parliamentary procedures to eliminate them.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Indian political system, particularly the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and the Council of Ministers.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body               Primary Function
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :  Advising the President on matters of national security
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)     :  Overseeing the functioning of the Election Commission
3. Election Commission of India (ECI)       :  Conducting recruitment examinations for civil services
4. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):  Auditing government accounts and expenditure
5. Finance Commission                     :  Recommending distribution of financial resources between the Union and States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because the Election Commission of India (ECI) is primarily responsible for conducting elections, and the Finance Commission recommends the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States.  Let's examine why other options are incorrect:

* **Option (a):** UPSC's primary function is conducting recruitment for civil services, not advising on national security.  National security advice falls under the purview of other bodies like the National Security Council.

* **Option (b):** The CAG audits government accounts, and the ECI is an independent body, not overseen by the CAG.  The ECI reports directly to the Parliament.

* **Option (c):** While the NHRC deals with human rights violations, it doesn't directly allocate financial resources. The Finance Commission is responsible for the distribution of financial resources, as mentioned earlier.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legislative Body              Power/Responsibility
1. Lok Sabha                     :  Appointing the judges of the Supreme Court
2. Rajya Sabha                    :  Initiating impeachment proceedings against the President
3. Parliament (Lok Sabha & Rajya Sabha):  Determining the size of the Council of Ministers
4. State Legislative Assemblies    :  Passing Money Bills exclusively
5. State Legislative Councils     :  Ratifying Constitutional Amendments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Rajya Sabha plays a crucial role in the impeachment process of the President, and the Parliament as a whole (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha)  determines the size of the Council of Ministers although the Constitution doesn't specify a precise limit.

Let's examine the incorrect options:

* **Option (a):** The President, not the Lok Sabha, appoints Supreme Court judges. The Lok Sabha has a critical role in approving the budget and legislation.

* **Option (c):** While Parliament (including the Lok Sabha)  passes Money Bills, they are not exclusive to Lok Sabha.  Rajya Sabha can only delay, not prevent, them. State Legislative Assemblies also pass their own budget.

* **Option (d):**  While Rajya Sabha participates in the amendment process, ratification by state legislatures is also required for certain amendments.  State Legislative Councils are not involved in the process of Constitutional Amendments.


**3. With reference to the Council of Ministers, consider the following pairs:**

  Ministerial Position          Key Responsibility Area
1. Prime Minister                :  Chairing the Finance Commission
2. Home Minister                 :  Overseeing national defence policy
3. Finance Minister              :  Managing the internal security of the nation
4. Minister of External Affairs  :  Presenting the Union Budget to Parliament
5. Cabinet Secretary             :  Heading the Cabinet Secretariat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. The Cabinet Secretary heads the Cabinet Secretariat.  Let's analyze the incorrect pairs:

* **Pair 1:** The Prime Minister does not chair the Finance Commission; that is an independent body. The Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers.

* **Pair 2:** The Defence Minister, not the Home Minister, primarily oversees national defence policy. The Home Minister is responsible for internal security.

* **Pair 3:** The Home Minister, not the Finance Minister, is primarily responsible for internal security. The Finance Minister manages the national economy.

* **Pair 4:** The Finance Minister, not the Minister of External Affairs, presents the Union Budget to Parliament. The Minister of External Affairs deals with foreign policy.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Amendment Act   Specific Provision
1. 73rd Amendment Act             :  Established the National Green Tribunal
2. 74th Amendment Act             :  Provided for the establishment of Municipalities
3. 91st Amendment Act             :  Introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
4. 101st Amendment Act            :  Limited the size of the Council of Ministers to 15% of Lok Sabha strength
5. 42nd Amendment Act            :  Introduced the concept of Fundamental Duties


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. The 74th Amendment Act dealt with urban local bodies, the 91st Amendment Act introduced GST, and the 42nd Amendment Act introduced Fundamental Duties.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Option 1:** The National Green Tribunal was established by a separate act, not the 73rd Amendment. The 73rd Amendment primarily focused on Panchayati Raj Institutions.

* **Option 4:** The 91st Amendment Act, not the 101st, limited the size of the Council of Ministers (although there is no mention of the 15% limit in the Constitution itself).


**5. With reference to the Indian President, consider the following pairs:**

      Power/Function                     Article Number
1.  Impeachment of the President          :  Article 61
2.  Election of the President              :  Article 54
3.  Powers and functions of the President:  Article 52
4.  Qualifications for President          :  Article 58
5.  Removal of the President              : Article 70


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Article 61 details the impeachment process for the President, Article 54 outlines the election process, and Article 58 specifies the qualifications.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Pair 3:** Article 52 defines the office of the President, not the powers and functions.  The powers and functions are detailed across several articles.

* **Pair 5:** Article 70 does not deal with the removal of the President.  The removal process is covered under Article 61 (impeachment).


These questions require in-depth knowledge of the Indian Constitution and political system, making them suitable for the UPSC examination's challenging nature and focus on factual recall and analysis.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidates' understanding of closely related concepts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                      Characteristic
1. Rajya Sabha                              :   Elected members only participate in Presidential elections
2. Lok Sabha                               :   Has the power to introduce Money Bills
3. National Development Council           :   Constituted by the Government of India
4. Planning Commission                     :   No longer exists as an independent body
5. Committee on Welfare of SCs & STs      :  Includes members from both Houses of Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because the following pairs are correctly matched:

* **Pair 2:**  The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament, holds the primary power to introduce Money Bills.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations, but the Lok Sabha has the final say.
* **Pair 3:** The National Development Council (NDC) is a body constituted by the Government of India to address national economic development.  It’s not a constitutional body but a crucial forum for policy coordination.
* **Pair 5:** The Committee on the Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes includes members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, reflecting the bicameral nature of the Indian Parliament and its commitment to representing diverse interests.

The other pairs are incorrectly matched:

* **Pair 1:** Nominated members of the Rajya Sabha also participate in the Presidential elections.  The statement is therefore inaccurate.
* **Pair 4:** The Planning Commission, which was responsible for economic planning in India, was dissolved and replaced by NITI Aayog.  The statement is therefore inaccurate.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                     Function/Power
1. Supreme Court of India                 :   Resolves disputes between the Centre and States
2. Election Commission of India           :   Decides election schedules for all elections
3. Finance Commission                     :   Recommends principles for determining taxes for Panchayats
4. National Green Tribunal               :   Deals with environmental disputes
5. Attorney General of India             :   Appointed by the President of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five pairs

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because the following pairs are correctly matched:

* **Pair 1:** The Supreme Court of India possesses original jurisdiction to resolve disputes between the Union and the States. This is a key aspect of its role in maintaining federal balance.
* **Pair 3:** The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, is responsible for making recommendations to the President regarding the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States, including principles for determining taxes for Panchayats.
* **Pair 4:** The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a specialized body established to handle environmental disputes and provide environmental justice.

The other pairs are incorrectly matched:

* **Pair 2:** The Election Commission of India conducts elections and resolves disputes relating to elections but the Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule.
* **Pair 5:** The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President, but the statement is not completely reflective of its function.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006 :   State Forest Department initiates the process for determining forest rights

3. National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007 :   Applicable only to land acquisition for projects
4. PESA Act, 1996                              :   Provides self-governance in Scheduled Areas

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because the following pairs are correctly matched:

* **Pair 4:** The Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act aims to provide self-governance and empower Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas.
* **Pair 5:** The Consumer Protection Act establishes a three-tiered system of consumer dispute redressal, including District Forums.

The other pairs are incorrectly matched:

* **Pair 1:** Under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, the Gram Sabha initiates the process for determining forest rights.
* **Pair 3:** The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, is applicable to involuntary displacement due to various reasons, not just land acquisition for projects.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution             Subject Matter

* **Pair 2:** The Ashok Mehta Committee advocated for a two-tier Panchayati Raj system, focusing on streamlining the system.

The other pairs are incorrectly matched:

* **Pair 4:** While the L.M. Singhvi Committee addressed aspects of Panchayati Raj, it's not its sole or primary focus.
* **Pair 5:** The Sarkaria Commission focused on Centre-State relations, not Panchayati Raj specifically.

1. **Consider the following pairs:**

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Article 78 of the Indian Constitution mandates the Prime Minister to furnish information related to decisions of the Council of Ministers to the President. This ensures the President is kept informed about the government's functioning.  This directly addresses the relationship between the executive and the head of state. Option (a) is partially correct, but (c) is more comprehensive as it includes other relevant articles.

Article 74 deals with the Council of Ministers, including its advice to the President.  The President appoints the Prime Minister (Article 75) who then forms the Council of Ministers.  While the President's power is largely nominal, the Council of Ministers' advice is binding on the President. This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system of government in India.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are also correctly matched.

Article 81 pertains to the composition of the Lok Sabha (House of the People), which is one of the two houses of Parliament. This is unrelated to the executive structure or the President's role. Hence, pair 4 is incorrectly matched.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while (d) is incorrect due to the inclusion of the mismatched pair.


2. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement Regarding the Indian President    Correctness
1.  Appoints Attorney General from Supreme Court Judges only :  Correct
2.  Executive actions are taken in the President's name      :  Correct
3.  Council of Ministers' size cannot exceed 15% of Lok Sabha   :  Incorrect
4.  Bound to act solely on Council of Ministers' advice      :  Incorrect


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Attorney General, and the Constitution specifies the qualification to be a Judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court. This makes statement 1 correct.  All executive actions of the Government of India are indeed taken in the name of the President, even though the actual power rests with the Council of Ministers. This makes statement 2 correct.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Constitution limits the size of the Council of Ministers to 10%, not 15%, of the total strength of the Lok Sabha.  Statement 4 is also incorrect because while the President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, there are exceptions, particularly in situations where the advice is unconstitutional or against the spirit of the Constitution.  Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairs.


3. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Method of Electing the Indian President    Correctness
1. Proportional Representation             : Correct
2. Single Transferable Vote System         : Correct
3. First-Past-the-Post System             : Incorrect


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India is elected using the system of Proportional Representation by means of the single transferable vote.  This method ensures that the elected candidate has a majority of votes.  The system is designed to give representation proportional to the votes received by different candidates. The single transferable vote ensures that even if no candidate secures an absolute majority in the first round, the process continues until a candidate achieves it. Hence, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

The First-Past-the-Post system, where the candidate with the most votes wins, is not employed in the presidential election.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairs.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect or incomplete information.


4. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Head of the National Disaster Management Authority    Correctness
1. Prime Minister of India                           :  Correct
2. Home Minister of India                             :  Incorrect
3. President of India                                :  Incorrect


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Prime Minister of India heads the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). This is a crucial role in coordinating disaster relief and management across the country.  The NDMA's structure and functions are designed to ensure effective response to various types of disasters. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The Home Minister and the President do not head the NDMA.  Their roles in disaster management are different, and they may be involved in policy-making or oversight but not as the head of the organization. Hence, pairs 2 and 3 are incorrectly matched. Option (a) precisely identifies the correctly matched pair. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


5. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Description of the Union Cabinet        Correctness
1. Part of the Parliament                 : Incorrect
2. Responsible to the Parliament           : Correct
3. Remains in power until it enjoys Parliament's confidence: Correct
4.  Can include a person from outside Parliament: Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Union Cabinet is not a part of the Parliament; it is the executive branch of the government.  However, it is responsible to the Parliament and must maintain the confidence of the Lok Sabha to remain in power. These are fundamental aspects of the parliamentary system. Hence, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

A person from outside Parliament can be appointed to the Cabinet, although this is less common.  The Cabinet's responsibility to the Parliament is a key feature of the system of checks and balances.  Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairs.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect or incomplete information.


6. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement Regarding the Vice-President of India    Correctness
1. Eligible for re-election                               : Incorrect
2. Must be at least 35 years old                          : Correct
3. Elected by both Houses of Parliament                  : Correct
4. Term of office is five years                            : Correct


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Vice-President of India is eligible for re-election, unlike the statement in pair 1. The minimum age requirement is 35 years, the election is conducted by an electoral college comprising members of both Houses of Parliament, and the term of office is five years. These are all accurate descriptions of the Vice-President's position. Therefore, pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) either include incorrect information or are incomplete.



7. **Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement Regarding the President's Term of Office    Correctness
1. Term is five years                                   : Correct
2. Removal by impeachment                             : Correct
3. Resignation by writing to the Speaker of Lok Sabha : Incorrect
4. Continues until successor takes office                : Correct


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The President's term is five years, removal is possible through impeachment, and the President continues to hold office until the successor assumes office. These are all accurate statements about the President's term. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.

However, the President does not resign by writing to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha; the resignation is addressed to the Vice-President.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Option (a) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect information.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article Number              Subject Matter Related to the President
1. Article 52                  :  Vice-President's election
2. Article 54                  :  President's term length
3. Article 55                  :  President's qualifications
4. Article 61                  :  Procedure for impeachment of the President
5. Article 72                  :  President's pardoning power

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 52 of the Indian Constitution defines the office of the President, not the Vice-President's election.  The Vice-President's election is detailed in Article 66.  Article 54 deals with the election of the President, and Article 55 outlines the manner of such election. Article 56 specifies the term of office of the President, not Article 54. Article 57 deals with the eligibility for re-election of the President. Article 58 outlines the qualifications for the President of India, not Article 55. Article 61 details the procedure for the impeachment of the President, making option 4 correct. Finally, Article 72 correctly pertains to the President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence.  Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs involving Articles 52, 54, and 55.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Position Held
1. Jawaharlal Nehru           :  Governor of a State
2. Dr. Rajendra Prasad        :  Prime Minister of India
3.  A candidate                :  Vice-President of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru never held the position of Governor of a State; he served as the first Prime Minister of India. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the first President of India, not the Prime Minister. A candidate for the Presidential election can be elected to the position of President, but not automatically to the position of Vice-President. The Vice-President is elected separately.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Power of the President      Description
1. Appoints Prime Minister     :   Based solely on the President's discretion
2. Promulgates Ordinances      :   Requires prior approval from Parliament
3. Assents to Bills             :  Can withhold assent to Money Bills only
4. Dissolves Lok Sabha         :   On the advice of the Prime Minister

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the Prime Minister, but it's not solely based on discretion; while the President has a nominal role, the convention is to appoint the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha. The President promulgates ordinances when Parliament is not in session, not requiring prior approval. The President can withhold assent to any bill, including ordinary bills, not just money bills.  The President dissolves the Lok Sabha on the advice of the Prime Minister, making option 4 the only correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1.  The President appoints the Governors of States.
2.  The President can dismiss the Council of Ministers.
3.  The President's term is five years.
4. The President can only promulgate ordinances when both houses of Parliament are not in session.
5.  The President can pardon death sentences.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The President appoints the Governors of States. Statement 2 is correct: The President can dismiss the Council of Ministers. Statement 3 is correct: The President's term is five years. Statement 4 is incorrect: The President can promulgate ordinances even if only one house of Parliament is not in session.  Statement 5 is correct: The President possesses the power to pardon death sentences. Therefore, statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correct.


**5. With reference to the President of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision      Power/Function
1. Article 53                  :  Head of the Union Executive
2. Article 56                  :  Impeachment Procedure
3. Article 72                  :  Pardoning Power
4. Article 111                 :  Assent to Bills
5. Article 352                 :  Proclamation of Financial Emergency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 53 correctly states that the executive power of the Union shall be vested in the President and shall be exercised by him, either directly or through officers subordinate to him. Article 56 deals with the term of office of the President, not the impeachment procedure (Article 61). Article 72 correctly grants the President the power of pardon. Article 111 correctly describes the President's powers regarding assent to bills.  Article 352 correctly deals with the President's power to proclaim a National Emergency, not a Financial Emergency (Article 360). Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Power of the Governor       Source of Power
1. Appointing the Chief Minister: Article 163
2. Dissolving the Legislative Assembly: Article 174
3. Granting Pardons            : Article 161
4. Promulgating Ordinances     : Article 213
5. Appointing the Advocate General:  Article 165


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Governor appoints the Chief Minister under Article 164, not Article 163 (which deals with the Council of Ministers). The Governor dissolves the Legislative Assembly under Article 174. The Governor's pardoning power is derived from Article 161. The Governor's ordinance-making power is given by Article 213. The Governor appoints the Advocate General as per Article 165. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article        Power/Function
1. Article 153                  :  Term of Office
2. Article 154                  :  Executive Power of the State
3. Article 161                  :  Power to Appoint Chief Minister
4. Article 174                  :  Summoning, Proroguing, and Dissolving the State Legislature
5. Article 200                  :  Assent to Bills


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 153 deals with the existence of the Governor's office, not their term of office (Article 156).  Article 154 correctly vests the executive power of the state in the Governor.  The Governor doesn't appoint the Chief Minister directly; that's a consequence of the Governor's power to invite the leader of the majority party (Article 164). Article 174 correctly describes the Governor's power over the State Legislature.  Article 200 correctly pertains to the Governor's assent to Bills passed by the State Legislature. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include mismatched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Power              Nature of Power
1. Ordinance-making power       :  Discretionary power
2. Pardoning power               :  Bound by Ministerial Advice
3. Power to reserve bills        :  Constitutional Discretion
4. Appointing the Chief Minister:  Situational Discretion
5. Summoning the State Legislature:  Bound by Ministerial Advice


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The ordinance-making power of the Governor is not a discretionary power; it's typically exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The pardoning power is also not entirely discretionary; while the Governor has some discretion, it's not solely at their whim. The power to reserve bills for the President's consideration is a Constitutional discretion.  Appointing the Chief Minister involves situational discretion, especially in hung assemblies.  The power to summon the State Legislature is also typically exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.



**9. Consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can dismiss a Governor.
2. The Governor of a State can dismiss the Chief Minister.
3. The President of India appoints the Chief Minister of a State.
4. The Governor of a State can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly.
5. The Governor of a State can withhold assent to a Money Bill.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The President of India can dismiss a Governor.  Statement 2 is correct: The Governor can dismiss a Chief Minister if they lose the confidence of the State Legislative Assembly. Statement 3 is incorrect: The President doesn't directly appoint the Chief Minister; the Governor appoints the leader of the majority party in the Legislative Assembly. Statement 4 is correct: The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly under certain circumstances. Statement 5 is incorrect: The Governor cannot withhold assent to a Money Bill; they must give assent to it. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**10. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body           Primary Function
1. Union Public Service Commission  :  Advising on matters related to the President's impeachment
2. Comptroller and Auditor General :  Auditing the accounts of the Union and States
3. Finance Commission            :    Conducting elections for the President
4. Election Commission            :   Recommending the President's salary
5. National Human Rights Commission:  Protecting and promoting human rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UPSC advises on civil service matters, not on the President's impeachment (that's Parliament's role). The CAG correctly audits accounts. The Finance Commission makes recommendations on financial distribution, not on the President's salary (that's Parliament's role). The Election Commission conducts elections, but not the President's election (that's the Electoral College). The NHRC correctly protects and promotes human rights.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) contain mismatched pairs.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions on the President and Prime Minister of India, based on the provided target content.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria.  Note that due to the vastness of the topic and the constraint of 8192 tokens, it is impossible to cover every aspect of the President and Prime Minister's roles comprehensively within this response.  The questions below aim for a representative sample covering a range of complexities.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure              Power/Function
1. President of India           :   Appoints the Chief Justice of India
2. Prime Minister of India      :   Presents the Union Budget to Parliament
3. President of India           :   Commands the Indian Armed Forces
4. Prime Minister of India      :   Nominates members to the Rajya Sabha
5. President of India           :   Dissolves the Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India (Article 124), is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces, and possesses the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha (Article 85).  Option (b) correctly identifies these powers.  The Prime Minister does *not* present the Union Budget; this is done by the Finance Minister on behalf of the government. While the Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers that advises the President, the President formally presents the budget to Parliament. The Prime Minister also does not nominate members to the Rajya Sabha; this is a power vested in the President.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pairs involving the Prime Minister's functions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article        Provision Related To
1. Article 72                     :   President's power to grant pardons
2. Article 74                     :   Council of Ministers' advice to the President
3. Article 78                     :   Prime Minister's duties to keep the President informed
4. Article 53                     :   Executive power of the Union
5. Article 52                     :   Definition of the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 72 details the President's power of pardon, reprieve, remission, etc. Article 74 relates to the Council of Ministers' aid and advice to the President. Article 78 outlines the Prime Minister's duty to keep the President informed. Article 53 vests the executive power of the Union in the President. Finally, Article 52 defines the office of the President.  Therefore, there are no incorrect pairings, making option (d) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                  Position Held
1. Rajendra Prasad             :   First President of India
2. Jawaharlal Nehru            :   First Prime Minister of India
3. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel    :   First Deputy Prime Minister of India
4. B.R. Ambedkar               :   Chairman, Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly
5. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad    :   First Education Minister of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Rajendra Prasad was the first President of India, Jawaharlal Nehru the first Prime Minister, Sardar Patel the first Deputy Prime Minister, B.R. Ambedkar chaired the Drafting Committee, and Maulana Azad was the first Education Minister.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  No other option includes all the correct pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Veto Power          Description
1. Absolute Veto              :   The President can reject a bill outright.
2. Suspensive Veto            :   The President can return a bill to Parliament for reconsideration.
3. Pocket Veto                 :   The President takes no action on a bill, effectively killing it.
4. Qualified Veto              :  The President's veto can be overridden by a supermajority in Parliament.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The descriptions of Absolute, Suspensive, and Pocket veto powers of the President are accurate. However, the Indian President does *not* possess a Qualified Veto; this is a feature of some other presidential systems (like the US). The Indian President's veto can be overridden by a simple majority in Parliament for ordinary bills and it is absolute for Money bills. Thus, only options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect description of the Qualified Veto.


**5. With reference to the office of the President of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Power/Function                      Article of the Constitution
1. Impeachment of the President       :   Article 61
2. Executive Power of the Union       :   Article 53
3. Election of the President         :   Article 54
4. Oath or affirmation by the President:   Article 60
5. Proclamation of Emergency          :   Article 352


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links a power or function of the President to the relevant article in the Indian Constitution.  Article 61 details the process of impeachment, Article 53 vests executive power in the President, Article 54 outlines the election process, Article 60 deals with the oath, and Article 352 covers the proclamation of emergency.  All pairings are accurate; hence, option (d) is correct.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body             Function
1. Union Public Service Commission:  Appoints judges to the Supreme Court
2. Election Commission of India     :   Conducts elections for the President
3. Finance Commission              :    Advises on the distribution of financial resources between Centre and States
4. Comptroller and Auditor General:   Audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments
5. National Human Rights Commission:  Protects human rights in India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission conducts elections to the Presidential office. The Finance Commission advises the President on the distribution of revenues. The CAG audits the accounts of the Centre and states. The NHRC protects human rights.  The UPSC does *not* appoint judges to the Supreme Court; the President does this based on the recommendation of the collegium. Thus, only options 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because of the mismatched pair involving the UPSC.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Office Holder                   Power/Function
1. Prime Minister                 :   Appoints Governors of States
2. President                      :   Presides over joint sittings of Parliament
3. Governor                       :   Dissolves the State Legislative Assembly
4. Attorney General of India      :   Appoints the Chief Election Commissioner
5. Chief Justice of India         :  Administers oath to the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) Only 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The President presides over joint sittings of Parliament. The Governor can dissolve the State Legislative Assembly. The Chief Justice of India administers the oath to the President. The Prime Minister does not appoint Governors (the President does). The Attorney General does not appoint the Chief Election Commissioner (the President does). Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Council/Commission             Chairperson/Head
1. NITI Aayog                     :   Prime Minister
2. Finance Commission              :   President
3. GST Council                     :   Union Finance Minister
4. Inter-State Council             :   Prime Minister
5. National Human Rights Commission:   President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Prime Minister chairs NITI Aayog and the Inter-State Council. The President does not chair the Finance Commission or the National Human Rights Commission; they are headed by a chairperson appointed by the President and a chairperson appointed by the President respectively.  The GST Council is headed by the Union Finance Minister.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect, and only option (d) is correct.


These questions demonstrate the application of factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills, and aim for a difficult level by using plausible distractors.  They also avoid obviousness and incorporate varied question structures within the prescribed format.  Remember that these are just examples; a comprehensive examination would require a wider range of questions covering other facets of the President and Prime Minister's roles.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the vastness of the information provided in the target content, creating many unique and challenging questions while strictly adhering to all constraints is difficult and some repetition in the nature of the pairs might be unavoidable.  Also, the explanations are concise to stay within token limits.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual      Role in Constituent Assembly
1.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad     :  Temporary President
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru       :  Vice-President
3.  V.T. Krishnamachari    :  Member of Drafting Committee
4.  G.V. Mavlankar          :  Chairman of Legislative Body


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Dr. Rajendra Prasad was initially elected as the temporary president of the Constituent Assembly.  V.T. Krishnamachari was a member of the Constituent Assembly and involved in its proceedings, though not specifically in the Drafting Committee. G.V. Mavlankar chaired the Constituent Assembly after it transformed into the Parliament of free India. Jawaharlal Nehru held significant roles but not as Vice-President of the Constituent Assembly.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the Constituent Assembly, consider the following pairs:**

   Group/Entity        Representation
1.  Muslim League        :  Complete Boycott
2.  Scheduled Castes    :  Significant Representation
3.  Princely States      :  Initial Lack of Participation
4.  Indian National Congress:  Dominant Majority


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Muslim League initially participated but later withdrew, effectively boycotting the proceedings. Scheduled Castes had significant representation, advocating for their rights.  Princely states initially hesitated but eventually joined. The Indian National Congress held a dominant position within the Assembly. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (b) is partially correct but omits correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect due to the incorrect classification of the Muslim League's role.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Document             Constituent Assembly Action
1.  Indian Independence Act 1947 :  Modified by the Assembly
2.  Objectives Resolution    :  Adopted by the Assembly
3.  National Anthem          :  Adopted by the Assembly
4.  Government of India Act 1935:  Basis for the Assembly's structure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Constituent Assembly modified the provisions of the Indian Independence Act.  The Objectives Resolution, National Anthem, and National Flag were all adopted by the Assembly. While the Government of India Act 1935 influenced the Assembly's formation, it wasn't directly adopted as a structural basis.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are partially correct or entirely incorrect due to mismatching at least one pair.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Article               Subject Matter
1.  Article 355           :  Protection of States
2.  Article 143           :  President's Consultation with Supreme Court
3.  Article 263           :  Inter-State Council
4.  Article 342-A         :  Empowers the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Article 355 mandates the Union's duty to protect states. Article 143 allows the President to consult the Supreme Court. Article 263 deals with the Inter-State Council. Article 342-A empowers the President regarding Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  All pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commission            Focus Area
1.  Sarkaria Commission  :  Removal of State Governor
2.  Punchhi Commission   :  Centre-State Relations
3.  Venkatachaliah Commission:  Judicial Reforms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While the Sarkaria Commission examined Centre-State relations, it did not specifically focus on the removal of Governors. The Punchhi Commission also delved into Centre-State relations. The Venkatachaliah Commission focused on judicial reforms. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (b) is partially correct but omits correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect due to the misclassification of the Sarkaria Commission's focus.


**6. With reference to the President of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Power/Function          Correct Description
1.  Pardon Power           :  Limited Judicial Review
2.  Supreme Commander     :  Of the Indian Armed Forces
3.  Appointment of Governors:  With Consultation
4.  Promulgation of Ordinances:  During Recess of Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The President's pardon power has limited judicial review. The President is the Supreme Commander of the armed forces.  The President appoints Governors after consultation. The President can promulgate ordinances during parliamentary recess. All pairs are correctly matched, so options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                    Position
1.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar     :  President of Constituent Assembly
2.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad    :  President of Constituent Assembly
3.  Jawaharlal Nehru       :  President of Constituent Assembly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the President of the Constituent Assembly.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Jawaharlal Nehru were influential members, but not the President. Option (a), (c) and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**8. With reference to the Attorney-General of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                 Accuracy
1.  Must have Supreme Court Judge Qualifications: Incorrect
2.  Whole-time Government Counsel: Correct
3.  Right to Speak in Parliament: Correct


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Attorney-General does not need the same qualifications as a Supreme Court Judge. The Attorney-General is a whole-time counsel for the government. The Attorney-General has the right to speak in Parliament. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (c) is partially correct, but it includes the incorrectly matched pair. Option (d) is completely incorrect due to the misclassification of the first pair.


These questions aim to be challenging by using close but incorrect information as distractors, requiring precise factual recall and careful analysis of the pairs.  The explanations highlight the key elements for correct matching and point out the flaws in the incorrect options.  Remember that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's knowledge base.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment      Impact on Governmental Body
1. 42nd Amendment                 :   Strengthened the power of the President
2. 42nd Amendment                 :   Reduced the jurisdiction of the High Courts
3. 44th Amendment                 :   Limited the power of the Parliament to amend Fundamental Rights
4. 44th Amendment                 :   Enhanced the power of the Supreme Court  
5. First Amendment                :   Curtailed the power of the judiciary


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment significantly altered the balance of power within the Indian government.  While it did not inherently strengthen the President's power in a direct way, its expansion of the Directive Principles of State Policy and the addition of the words "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble indirectly impacted the executive's role in implementing these social and economic goals.  Crucially, the 42nd Amendment curtailed the power of judicial review, limiting the ability of the Supreme Court and High Courts to strike down legislation. This is accurately reflected in pair 2. Pair 3 is correct as the 44th Amendment limited Parliament's ability to amend Fundamental Rights by introducing the concept of the "basic structure" doctrine, thereby enhancing the power of judicial review and indirectly strengthening the Supreme Court.  Pair 1 is incorrect because the 42nd Amendment did not directly strengthen the President’s power, though it did add to the Directive Principles of State Policy, which can be seen as influencing the role of the executive. Pair 4 is incorrect; the 44th Amendment aimed to restore the balance of power shifted by the 42nd Amendment, not to enhance the Supreme Court's power in a new way. Pair 5 is incorrect; the First Amendment aimed to address concerns related to freedom of speech, not to curtail judicial power.

**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Provision                     Specific impact
1. Article 32                          :   Right to Constitutional Remedies
2. Article 356                         :   Imposition of President's Rule
3. Article 360                         :   Financial Emergency
4. Article 21                           :  Right to education
5. Article 143                         :   Advisory Opinion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 32 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, providing individuals with avenues to enforce their Fundamental Rights. This is a direct and accurate match. Article 356 empowers the President to impose President's rule in a state if the constitutional machinery in that state breaks down.  Article 360 deals with the proclamation of a financial emergency. Article 143 allows the President to seek the advisory opinion of the Supreme Court on any question of law or fact of public importance.  Pair 4 is incorrect; while Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, the right to education was later added as a Fundamental Right through the 86th Amendment.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Document                     Key Provision
1. The 42nd Amendment              :   Added the words "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble
2. The Government of India Act, 1935:   Established a federal structure
3. The Nehru Report                  :   Proposed Fundamental Rights
4. The Indian Independence Act, 1947:  Established the Dominion of India and Pakistan
5. The Poona Pact                     :   Addressed the representation of Dalits


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 is correctly paired with its addition of "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble. The Government of India Act 1935 is accurately linked to its establishment of a federal structure in India, albeit a limited one compared to the post-independence structure. The Nehru Report, a significant document in India's constitutional history, famously proposed a set of Fundamental Rights. The Indian Independence Act of 1947 is correctly paired with its establishment of India and Pakistan as independent dominions. Pair 5 is incorrect. The Poona Pact, a crucial agreement between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, dealt with the representation of Dalits in the legislatures, not a constitutional provision.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act                                       Significant Change
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act       :   Established Urban Local Bodies
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act       :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 86th Constitutional Amendment Act       :   Made Right to Education a Fundamental Right
4. 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act       :   Introduced Fundamental Duties
5. 101st Constitutional Amendment Act     :    Introduced GST


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c) Only three

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act established Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the village, intermediate, and district levels. The 74th Amendment Act established Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) giving them a constitutional status.  The 86th Amendment Act added the right to education as a Fundamental Right under Article 21A.  The 42nd Amendment Act introduced Fundamental Duties in Part IV-A of the Constitution. The 101st Amendment Act introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pairs 4 and 5 are incorrect because the 42nd Amendment dealt with Fundamental Duties, not Fundamental Rights, and the 101st Amendment dealt with GST, not Panchayats or ULBs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body                Key Function
1. Union Public Service Commission  :   Conducts examinations for state-level civil services
2. Comptroller and Auditor General  :   Audits the accounts of the state governments
3. Election Commission of India       :   Conducts elections for the President
4. Finance Commission                 :   Recommends the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States
5. National Human Rights Commission:    Investigates human rights violations at the state level


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Explanation:**

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts examinations for various central government services, including All India Services.  However, it can also, under certain conditions, conduct examinations for state-level civil services.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits the accounts of both the Union and state governments. The Election Commission of India conducts elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the states. Pair 5 is incorrect. Though the National Human Rights Commission investigates human rights violations, its jurisdiction extends to the entire country, not just the state level.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

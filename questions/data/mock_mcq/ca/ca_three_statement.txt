Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', leveraging misleading information and plausible distractors to challenge even well-prepared candidates.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Ahilyabai Holkar's reign:**

1. Ahilyabai Holkar, who ruled in the 17th century, significantly expanded the Maratha Empire's territory in the Deccan region.
2.  Her administration in Malwa was characterized by a decentralized system, empowering local village headmen.
3.  Ahilyabai Holkar's extensive temple reconstruction projects primarily focused on temples dedicated to Lord Shiva in South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies.  Statement 1 incorrectly places Ahilyabai Holkar's reign in the 17th century; she ruled during the 18th century.  While she did rule Malwa, a part of the Maratha Empire, her administration was known for its *centralized* system, not decentralized as suggested in Statement 2.  Statement 3 is incorrect because, although she did extensive temple renovations, her projects were spread across India and included temples dedicated to various deities, not solely Shiva in South India.  Her reconstruction of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and the Somnath Temple in Gujarat are notable examples.  The emphasis on decentralized administration and exclusive focus on Shiva temples in South India are deliberate distractors designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of Ahilyabai Holkar's rule.


**2. With reference to Ahilyabai Holkar and Maheshwar, consider the following statements:**

1. Maheshwar, Ahilyabai Holkar's capital, primarily thrived due to its strategic location on major trade routes connecting Central Asia and the Deccan.
2. The Maheshwari sari, a renowned textile product, originated from the flourishing textile industry in Maheshwar during the reign of Ahilyabai Holkar, but was primarily patronized by the Mughal court.
3. The textile industry of Maheshwar, established during Ahilyabai Holkar's reign, significantly contributed to the economic prosperity of the region, but declined sharply after her death due to lack of royal patronage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Maheshwar's location did contribute to its prosperity, its growth wasn't solely dependent on trade routes connecting Central Asia and the Deccan.  It had its own internal economic dynamism, particularly in textiles.  Statement 2 is incorrect because, while the Maheshwari sari did originate in Maheshwar during Ahilyabai Holkar's time, it was primarily patronized by the local population and Maratha court, not the Mughal court.  Statement 3 is largely correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage indeed boosted the Maheshwar textile industry, contributing to the region's economic well-being. However, the suggestion of a sharp decline immediately after her death requires nuance; the industry's fate was influenced by various factors beyond royal patronage in subsequent years.


**3. With reference to the Bhils, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhil language, spoken primarily in the eastern and northeastern states of India, belongs to the Dravidian language family.
2.  Bhils are recognized as one of the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in many western and central Indian states.
3.  Bhils are primarily known for their expertise in pottery and metalwork, which formed the basis of their economic activities in pre-colonial times.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are inaccurate.  Statement 1 mislocates the Bhil population and misidentifies the language family.  Bhil languages are primarily spoken in the western and central parts of India and belong to the Indo-Aryan language family, not Dravidian.  Statement 2 is incorrect as Bhils are not universally classified as PVTGs; while some subgroups might be, it's not a blanket classification across all Bhil communities in western and central India.  Statement 3 is wrong because Bhils were traditionally known for their skills in *archery and agriculture*, not primarily pottery and metalwork although some subgroups might have engaged in these crafts. The incorrect language family, PVTG status, and primary economic activities are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Vedas:**

1. The Yajurveda, predating the Rigveda, is primarily a collection of prose mantras used in sacrificial rituals.
2. The Atharvaveda, composed entirely in verse, focuses on hymns dedicated to nature deities and cosmic phenomena.
3. The Samaveda is a collection of verses, mostly drawn from the Rigveda, arranged in a melodic form for chanting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rigveda is generally considered the oldest Veda, and the Yajurveda contains both prose and verse mantras. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atharvaveda contains both prose and verse and focuses on spells, charms, and incantations related to daily life, healing, and protection, not solely hymns to nature. Statement 3 accurately describes the Samaveda. It's a collection of melodies and chants, primarily derived from the Rigveda, intended for musical performance in rituals. The incorrect chronological order of the Vedas, the content of the Atharvaveda, and the nature of the Samaveda are crucial distractors.


**5. With reference to the Sengol, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sengol, a symbol of power and authority, originated in the Vijayanagara Empire and was used by its kings as a royal emblem.
2.  The Sengol, originally from Tamil Nadu, was presented to Jawaharlal Nehru by the then-ruler of Mysore.
3. The Sengol, a ceremonial sceptre, signifies kingship, righteousness, justice, and authority, with origins tracing back to the Chola dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sengol's origins are associated with the Chola dynasty, not the Vijayanagara Empire. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Sengol was presented to Jawaharlal Nehru by the Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam, a Saivite mutt in Tamil Nadu, not the ruler of Mysore. Statement 3 correctly identifies the Sengol as a ceremonial sceptre symbolizing kingship, righteousness, justice, and authority, with its origins in the Chola dynasty.  The incorrect attribution of origins to the Vijayanagara Empire, the presenter, and the deliberate confusion about the geographical location make this question challenging.


**6. With reference to Indian Art and Culture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kani Shawl, a unique hand-woven shawl, is primarily produced in the state of Odisha, known for its intricate designs and vibrant colors.
2.  The  Chhau dance form, known for its masks and vigorous movements, is exclusively performed in the state of West Bengal.
3. The Pattachitra, a traditional scroll painting of Odisha, is characterized by its use of natural pigments and depiction of mythological narratives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kani shawls are produced in Jammu and Kashmir, not Odisha. Statement 2 is incorrect. Chhau dance is performed in Odisha, West Bengal, and Jharkhand. Statement 3 correctly describes Pattachitra painting, highlighting its use of natural pigments and mythological themes. The incorrect geographical locations for the Kani shawl and Chhau dance, along with the accurate description of Pattachitra, create a difficult scenario for the candidate.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
2.  All PVTGs in India are exclusively located in the northeastern states.
3.  The number of PVTGs in India exceeds 100, with Odisha having the largest number.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the criteria used to identify PVTGs. Statement 2 is incorrect; PVTGs are not limited to the northeastern states; they are spread across various states in India. Statement 3 is correct. The number of PVTGs is 75 and Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs. The incorrect geographical distribution of PVTGs and the slightly off number of PVTGs serve as distractors.


**8. With reference to the  'Adopt a Heritage 2.0' Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The programme was launched by the Ministry of Culture and aims to involve private sector companies exclusively in the conservation of centrally protected monuments.
2. The programme encourages the adoption of monuments in entirety or specific amenities, using CSR funds or voluntary contributions.
3.  The programme's framework focuses solely on improving the aesthetic appeal of historical sites, without considering functional aspects like hygiene and accessibility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Ministry of Culture is involved, the program also involves public sector organizations and individuals, not just private sector companies. Statement 2 accurately describes the flexibility of the programme regarding adoption and funding sources.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the programme's four-pronged approach includes hygiene, accessibility, safety, and knowledge, not just aesthetics.  The inaccurate information about exclusive private sector involvement and the limited scope of the framework are intended to challenge the candidate.


**9. With reference to the National Mission for Cultural Mapping (NMCM), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMCM is a centrally-sponsored scheme implemented by the Ministry of Tourism, focusing on documenting intangible cultural heritage at the district level.
2.  The 'Mera Gaon Meri Dharohar' programme under NMCM utilizes Common Services Centres (CSCs) to collect data on various aspects of village life and upload it onto a dedicated application.
3. The NMCM aims to create a comprehensive digital archive of India's cultural heritage, but excludes the documentation of oral traditions and folk performances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMCM is implemented by the Ministry of Culture, not Tourism, and it documents at the village level, not just the district level. Statement 2 accurately describes the 'Mera Gaon Meri Dharohar' programme's mechanism. Statement 3 is incorrect because the NMCM includes documentation of oral traditions and folk performances. The incorrect implementing ministry, the level of documentation, and the exclusion of aspects of cultural heritage are designed to test the candidate's knowledge.



**10. Consider the following statements about the Keshava Temple at Somanathapura:**

1. The temple, built in the 13th century, is a Panchayatan style temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, showcasing intricate Hoysala architecture.
2.  The temple's construction was commissioned by Somanatha Dandanayaka, a general of the Hoysala king Narasimha III, and is renowned for its star-shaped plan.
3. The temple's sculptures predominantly depict scenes from the Ramayana, showcasing a blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles of temple architecture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the temple does showcase intricate Hoysala architecture and is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, it is a *Trikuta* style temple (three shrines), not Panchayatan (five shrines). Statement 2 is correct, accurately describing the temple's commissioning and its unique star-shaped plan. Statement 3 is incorrect; the sculptures primarily depict scenes from the *Bhagavata Purana*, not the Ramayana.  The incorrect architectural style, the epic depicted in the sculptures, and the number of shrines are used as distractors.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided knowledge base, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw the development of Indore into a significant trading center, while Maheshwar flourished as a center for textiles and the arts under her patronage.
2. Ahilyabai Holkar's architectural contributions extended to the restoration of several Jyotirlingas, including the Kashi Vishvanath Temple and the Somnath Temple.
3.  The Holkar dynasty's power base was initially established in Indore before Ahilyabai Holkar shifted the capital to Maheshwar on the banks of the Narmada River.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Ahilyabai Holkar's reign and legacy.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the economic and cultural growth of Indore and Maheshwar under her rule.  Her focus on trade and arts is well documented. Statement 2 is also accurate, as Ahilyabai Holkar is known for her extensive temple renovations, including significant contributions to the Kashi Vishvanath and Somnath temples.  Statement 3 correctly describes the Holkar dynasty's origins in Indore and Ahilyabai's subsequent establishment of Maheshwar as her capital. The chronological order of the establishment of power bases and the capital shift is historically accurate.  Therefore, option (d) is the most appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one factually correct statement.


**2. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology, high literacy rates, and a rapidly growing population.
2. Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs among Indian states, while Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh also have a significant PVTG population.
3.  PVTGs are a subset of Scheduled Tribes (STs) and are recognized by the Government of India based on specific socio-economic criteria, including a declining or stagnant population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because it presents a misleading picture of PVTG characteristics. While a pre-agricultural level of technology and a stagnant or declining population are indeed criteria, high literacy rates are not a characteristic of PVTGs; rather, low literacy is a defining factor.  Statement 2 is partially correct. Odisha does have the highest number of PVTGs. However, the statement inaccurately implies that only these three states have significant PVTG populations; many other states also have considerable numbers of PVTGs. Statement 3 correctly defines PVTGs as a subset of STs and accurately mentions the government's recognition process and the criteria used, including the demographic characteristic of a declining or stagnant population. Thus, only statement 3 is entirely accurate, making option (c) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the  Koya tribe, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Koya tribe is primarily located in Malkangiri district of South Odisha and is officially classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG).
2. Traditionally, Koyas are pastoralists and shifting cultivators, with cattle holding significant social status within their community, and they are known by different names in adjacent regions.
3. The Koya tribe recently faced a cultural crisis relating to the sacred Mahua flower in the Godavari valley of Andhra Pradesh, highlighting the vulnerability of their traditional practices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. While the Koyas are present in Malkangiri district of Odisha,  their distribution extends to Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  More importantly, they are *not* officially classified as a PVTG. Statement 2 accurately describes the traditional lifestyle of the Koyas, their dependence on cattle, and the variations in their nomenclature across regions. Statement 3 correctly reports the recent news about the cultural crisis concerning the Mahua flower in Andhra Pradesh.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are completely correct, leading to option (c) as the correct response.


**4. With reference to the Rigveda and other early Vedic texts, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rigveda, the oldest of the four Vedas, comprises 1028 hymns divided into ten mandalas, offering insights into the lives of early Vedic people.
2. The Samaveda primarily consists of verses borrowed from the Rigveda, arranged poetically for chanting and singing, while the Yajurveda focuses on mantras and ritual procedures.
3. The Atharvaveda is distinguished by its collection of spells, charms, and incantations aimed at warding off evil spirits and curing diseases, unlike the other Vedas which focus primarily on hymns and rituals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the content and characteristics of the Rigveda and other early Vedic texts. Statement 1 correctly describes the Rigveda's structure and its historical significance as a source for understanding early Vedic life. Statement 2 correctly identifies the Samaveda's relationship to the Rigveda and the Yajurveda's focus on ritualistic practices. Statement 3 accurately points out the Atharvaveda's unique focus on spells and charms, contrasting it with the other Vedas' emphasis on hymns and rituals.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.


**5. With reference to  Shivaji's administration, consider the following statements:**

1. Shivaji's administration was characterized by a decentralized system with significant power vested in local chiefs, while the Ashtapradhan council served as an advisory body.
2. Shivaji implemented significant revenue reforms, including the abolition of the Jagirdari system and the introduction of the Ryotwari system for more direct control over land revenue.
3.  The Ashtapradhan council, a key feature of Shivaji's administration, comprised eight ministers who headed different departments, contributing to a centralized system of governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Shivaji's administration, while utilizing local chiefs, was fundamentally *centralized*, with the king at its apex. The Ashtapradhan council played a crucial role in the centralized administration, but they were not merely an advisory body; they held significant executive power. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shivaji did undertake revenue reforms, he did *not* abolish the Jagirdari system entirely.  He modified it and implemented measures to monitor land rights more effectively. The Ryotwari system was not fully implemented during his reign. Statement 3 correctly describes the Ashtapradhan council's structure and its contribution to the centralized nature of Shivaji's administration.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate, making (c) the correct option.


**6. With reference to Birsa Munda, consider the following statements:**

1. Birsa Munda, a prominent tribal leader, advocated for a monotheistic faith and led a rebellion against British colonial rule in the Chotanagpur plateau region.
2. The Munda and Oraon communities actively participated in Birsa Munda's religious and anti-British movements, challenging British conversion efforts among tribal groups.
3. Birsa Munda's religious teachings emphasized the rejection of traditional tribal beliefs and promoted a complete assimilation into mainstream Hindu practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Birsa Munda's monotheistic beliefs and his leadership of a rebellion against British rule in the Chotanagpur region.  Statement 2 is also accurate; the participation of Munda and Oraon communities in his movements is well documented.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  Birsa Munda's religious teachings did *not* promote complete assimilation into mainstream Hindu practices; rather, he advocated for a return to what he considered to be original tribal religious beliefs, albeit infused with a monotheistic element. He did not reject traditional tribal beliefs entirely. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct, making (a) the correct answer.


**7. With reference to the Bhil tribe, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhils are the largest tribal group in India, primarily inhabiting Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh, and are known for their skill in archery and agriculture.
2. Bhil languages belong to the Indo-Aryan language family and are classified under the Central Zone, exhibiting a rich oral tradition and cultural heritage.
3. The Bhils have a vibrant cultural heritage, characterized by their expertise in pottery and weaving, alongside their oral traditions, music, dance, and agricultural practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately identifies the Bhils as the largest tribal group in India and correctly mentions their geographical distribution and skills in archery and agriculture. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Bhil languages are indeed Indo-Aryan, but they are classified under the *Western* Zone, not the Central Zone. Statement 3 is partially correct.  While the Bhils have a rich cultural heritage including oral traditions, music, dance, and agriculture, their expertise is more renowned in archery and other hunting/gathering skills than in pottery and weaving. Option (b) is therefore the correct answer as only statement 1 and 3 are fully accurate.


**8. With reference to the Sarod, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sarod, a plucked stringed instrument, is primarily associated with South Indian classical music and is known for its use in solo performances.
2. The Sarod's construction typically involves materials such as coconut shell, tun wood, and ivory, reflecting the instrument's unique craftsmanship.
3.  The Sarod's sound is characterized by its mellow and resonant tone, making it a versatile instrument used in various musical genres, including North Indian classical music.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect as the Sarod is strongly associated with *North* Indian classical music, not South Indian classical music. Statement 2 accurately describes the materials used in the Sarod's construction.  Statement 3 is also correct; the Sarod is known for its mellow and resonant tone and is indeed used in various musical genres, including North Indian classical music.  Therefore, option (b) is correct.


**9. With reference to Ram Prasad Bismil, consider the following statements:**

1. Ram Prasad Bismil, a prominent revolutionary, was born in 1897 in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) and was primarily involved in the Kakori Conspiracy of 1925.
2. Bismil founded the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and was executed for his revolutionary activities, playing a key role in the Mainpuri Conspiracy of 1918.
3.  Bismil's revolutionary activities involved participation in both the Mainpuri Conspiracy and the Kakori Conspiracy, leading to his execution in 1927.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Bismil was born in 1897 in the United Provinces and was involved in the Kakori Conspiracy,  the statement wrongly emphasizes only the Kakori Conspiracy, neglecting his involvement in the Mainpuri Conspiracy. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Bismil was involved in the founding of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which later evolved into the HSRA, but the statement mistakenly attributes the founding of the HSRA to him and wrongly mentions his role in the Mainpuri Conspiracy. Statement 3 accurately reflects Bismil's participation in both conspiracies and his execution year. Therefore, only statement 3 is completely correct, making (c) the right answer.


**10. With reference to the Raja Parba festival, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Parba, celebrated in Odisha, is a three-day festival primarily focused on the worship of Lord Jagannath and his consort, Bhudevi.
2. This festival is associated with the onset of the monsoon season and is observed by farmers as it signals the time for sowing.
3. Raja Parba is a unique festival that celebrates menstruation, challenging societal taboos and promoting women's empowerment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Raja Parba is celebrated in Odisha, it is not primarily focused on Lord Jagannath and Bhudevi; it is more broadly associated with womanhood and the fertility of the earth. Statement 2 accurately connects the festival with the monsoon season and its agricultural significance for farmers. Statement 3 is also correct; Raja Parba uniquely celebrates menstruation, challenging traditional taboos.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are fully accurate, resulting in (a) as the correct option.


**11.  With reference to  important temples in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kheer Bhawani temple in Tulmulla, Jammu and Kashmir, is located near a sacred spring whose waters are believed to change color, and is dedicated to Goddess Ragnya Devi, an incarnation of Goddess Durga.
2. The Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is a prime example of Dravidian architecture.
3. The Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, Assam, is one of the oldest and most revered centers of Tantric practices, dedicated to Goddess Kamakhya, and is the site of the annual Ambubachi Mela.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Kheer Bhawani Temple, its location, the characteristics of its sacred spring, and the presiding deity. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lingaraj Temple is dedicated to Lord *Shiva*, not Vishnu, and is a prime example of *Kalinga*, not Dravidian, architecture.  Statement 3 correctly describes the Kamakhya Temple, its association with Tantric practices, the presiding deity, and the Ambubachi Mela. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully correct, making (a) the correct answer.


**12. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The ancient Nalanda University, established in the 6th century CE by the Gupta ruler Chandragupta II, flourished for over 800 years before its destruction by Bakhtiar Khilji.
2. The university's ruins, including stupas, shrines, and viharas, showcase significant stucco, stone, and metal artwork, and its rediscovery and excavation were significant milestones in archaeological research.
3. Nalanda University received patronage from various rulers, including King Harshavardhana of Kannauj and the Pala rulers, demonstrating its enduring significance across different dynasties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While Nalanda University did flourish for over 800 years and was destroyed by Bakhtiar Khilji, the founder was *Kumaragupta I*, not Chandragupta II, and the establishment date is generally considered to be the 5th century CE. Statement 2 correctly describes the archaeological remains of Nalanda University and the importance of its rediscovery and excavation. Statement 3 accurately mentions the patronage received from Harshavardhana and the Pala rulers.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are completely correct, making (a) the correct option.


**13. With reference to Stonehenge, consider the following statements:**

1. Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument in England, was constructed entirely during the Bronze Age, showcasing advanced architectural techniques for its time.
2. The unique stone circle of Stonehenge was erected in the late Neolithic period, around 2500 BC, with the site subsequently witnessing the addition of burial mounds in the early Bronze Age.
3.  Stonehenge's construction involved several stages, beginning with an early henge monument approximately 5000 years ago, followed by the erection of the distinctive stone circle and later additions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Stonehenge's construction spanned across both the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.  It was not built entirely during the Bronze Age. Statement 2 is partially correct in mentioning the late Neolithic construction of the stone circle and the Bronze Age burial mounds. However, the date is slightly off; it should be more precisely stated as the late Neolithic, around 2500 BC. Statement 3 accurately describes the multi-stage construction of Stonehenge, encompassing both Neolithic and Bronze Age periods.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct, leading to (c) as the correct option.  The other options include at least one factually incorrect statement.



**14.  With reference to Mata ni Pachedi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mata ni Pachedi, a traditional art form from Gujarat, is primarily created by women of the Vaghari community and is inspired by the Mughal style of painting.
2. These paintings are predominantly used for religious rituals and depict scenes from Hindu mythology, with the divine feminine as a central figure.
3. Mata ni Pachedi paintings draw inspiration from Kalamkari, and they are created by men of the Vaghari community, primarily for ritualistic purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mata ni Pachedi is painted by *men* of the Vaghari community and is inspired by *Kalamkari*, not the Mughal style. Statement 2 is partially correct.  Mata ni Pachedi paintings are used for rituals and often show scenes from Hindu mythology, but the statement incorrectly emphasizes the divine feminine as the central figure. While the divine feminine is frequently depicted, it's not always the central focus.  Statement 3 is partially correct in mentioning Kalamkari inspiration and the Vaghari community's involvement. However, it incorrectly states that the paintings are created by men.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate, making (d) the correct answer.  Each statement contains at least one inaccuracy.


**15. With reference to the Union Tribal Affairs Ministry's concerns, consider the following statements:**

1. The ₹72,000-crore infrastructure project on Great Nicobar Island threatens the habitat of the Shompen tribe, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG).
2. The proposed project includes a large international container transhipment port that could significantly alter the island's environment and displace indigenous communities.
3. The Union Tribal Affairs Ministry has approved the proposed infrastructure project on Great Nicobar Island without considering the potential impact on the Shompen tribe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the project's impact on the Shompen tribe, a PVTG, is a major concern. Statement 2 is also correct; the large-scale infrastructure development, including the port, poses significant environmental threats and potential displacement of indigenous communities. Statement 3 is incorrect. The statement wrongly asserts that the ministry approved the project without considering the impact. The news explicitly states that the ministry *promised to look into* forest clearances, indicating that the impact on the Shompen tribe is being considered. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (a) the correct answer.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Shompen tribe, classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), primarily inhabits the Great Nicobar Island.
2.  The Great Nicobar International Container Transhipment Port (ICTP) project's forest clearance has raised concerns regarding the Shompen tribe's displacement.
3. The Union Tribal Affairs Ministry's review of the ICTP project's environmental impact assessment includes the potential impact on PVTGs, but excludes the Shompen tribe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Shompen are indeed a PVTG residing primarily on Great Nicobar Island.  Their vulnerability stems from their pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining population, all criteria for PVTG designation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The massive infrastructure project on Great Nicobar Island, particularly the ICTP, poses a significant threat to the Shompen's traditional way of life and their existence.  The potential for displacement and disruption of their habitat is a major concern.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Union Tribal Affairs Ministry is reviewing the project's environmental impact, it is highly unlikely they would exclude the Shompen, given their PVTG status and the significant impact the project could have on their community. The ministry's responsibility is to protect the rights and interests of all PVTGs, including the Shompen.  The statement creates a false sense of selective consideration.


**2. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir Das's teachings primarily focused on the worship of a formless Supreme God, drawing followers from both Hindu and Muslim communities.
2. The Bhakti movement primarily flourished in South India during the 15th and early 16th centuries, significantly impacting Tamil literature.
3.  The Adi Granth, a Sikh scripture, includes works by Kabir, reflecting the Bhakti movement's influence on Sikhism's development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Kabir's philosophy centered on a formless, nirguna Brahman, accessible through bhakti (devotion), transcending the rigid boundaries of Hinduism and Islam. His appeal to both communities was a significant aspect of the Bhakti movement's inclusivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement had a presence in South India, its major influence and flourishing period occurred in North India during the 15th and early 16th centuries.  The statement wrongly attributes the movement's peak to South India and specifies a time period that is partially incorrect.  While Tamil literature was impacted by the Bhakti movement, it wasn't the *primary* area of its influence.

Statement 3 is correct.  Kabir's verses are included in the Adi Granth, the foundational scripture of Sikhism. This inclusion highlights the Bhakti movement's broader impact on religious thought in India and its contribution to the formation of Sikh tenets.  The statement correctly identifies an interfaith linkage and factual inclusion.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN), consider the following statements:**

1.  Kozhikode, declared India's first UNESCO City of Literature, is located on the Malabar Coast in Kerala and is also known as Calicut.
2.  Before Kozhikode's inclusion, seven Indian cities—Gwalior, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Varanasi, Jaipur, and Srinagar—were already part of the UCCN, representing diverse creative fields.
3.  Kolkata and New Delhi are currently not listed as part of the UCCN, indicating a limited representation of India's major metropolitan areas within the network.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Kozhikode (Calicut) is situated on the Malabar Coast in Kerala and has been officially recognized as India's first UNESCO City of Literature.

Statement 2 is correct.  The given text explicitly states that Gwalior, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Varanasi, Jaipur, and Srinagar were part of the UCCN before Kozhikode's inclusion. This demonstrates the geographical diversity of India's representation in the network.

Statement 3 is also correct. The text clearly mentions that Kolkata and New Delhi are not yet part of the UCCN, which is a noteworthy point regarding the network's selection criteria and the representation of major Indian urban centers.  The statement highlights a significant exclusion.



**4. With reference to the Sengol, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sengol, a royal sceptre symbolizing kingship, righteousness, and authority, originated in Tamil Nadu and was used as a kingly emblem.
2.  Among the Madurai Nayakas, the Sengol was ceremonially placed before the goddess Meenakshi in the temple and then transferred to the throne room, signifying the king's divine authority.
3. The Sengol's transfer from the British to the Indian government in 1947 symbolized the transfer of power and the commencement of India's republican era, but it lacked religious significance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Sengol, a royal sceptre representing authority, originated in Tamil Nadu.  While it was a kingly emblem, the phrasing "used as a kingly emblem" is somewhat simplistic, as its usage was ritualistic and symbolic, not merely decorative.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the Sengol's ritualistic placement before the goddess Meenakshi and subsequent transfer to the throne room accurately reflects its usage within the Madurai Nayaka tradition, underscoring the king's role as a divinely appointed ruler.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the transfer of the Sengol in 1947 was a significant symbolic event, it's inaccurate to say it lacked religious significance.  The ritualistic practices associated with the Sengol among the Nayakas clearly demonstrate its religious and cultural importance. The statement misrepresents the significance of the Sengol and disregards its religious context.


**5. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Instituted in 1954, the Padma Awards are announced annually on Republic Day, recognizing exceptional and distinguished service across various fields.
2.  Government servants, including those in PSUs, are ineligible for Padma Awards, except for doctors and scientists, reflecting a focus on civilian contributions.
3.  A higher-category Padma award can be conferred only after a five-year gap from the previous award, with exceptions made by the Awards Committee for exceptional cases.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Padma Awards were established in 1954 and are generally announced on Republic Day. The awards recognize outstanding achievements and service across diverse sectors.

Statement 2 is correct.  The eligibility criteria for Padma Awards specifically exclude most government servants, with exceptions for doctors and scientists. This reflects a focus on recognizing contributions beyond regular government service.

Statement 3 is also correct. The rules regarding the time gap between receiving higher-category Padma awards are accurately represented. The five-year gap is a general rule, allowing for exceptions based on the committee's evaluation of exceptional merit.  The statement clarifies the nuanced eligibility criteria.


**6. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1. Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India, exceeding the number in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh combined.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3. The PM JANMAN (PM Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) scheme specifically targets PVTGs for their economic and social empowerment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Odisha has a significant number of PVTGs, the text indicates Odisha houses the highest number (13), but it doesn't explicitly state whether this exceeds the combined number in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  The statement presents a potentially misleading comparison.

Statement 2 is correct.  The criteria for PVTG identification are accurately listed in the text. These criteria highlight the unique vulnerabilities of these tribal groups.

Statement 3 is correct.  The PM JANMAN scheme is explicitly mentioned as a government initiative aimed at empowering PVTGs. This initiative demonstrates the government's focused approach to addressing the specific needs of these vulnerable communities.


**7. With reference to  Alluri Sitarama Raju and the Rampa Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. Alluri Sitarama Raju, born in Mogallu near Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh, launched the Rampa Rebellion in August 1922 against British rule and was martyred in May 1924.
2. The Rampa Rebellion, also known as the Manyam Rebellion, was a militant guerrilla movement that included attacks on police stations to acquire modern weapons.  The first such attack targeted the Chintapalli police station in Visakhapatnam.
3. The Rampa Rebellion was solely confined to the Rampa and Gudem Hills regions of Andhra Pradesh and did not inspire similar movements in other parts of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text gives Alluri Sitarama Raju's birthplace and the timeframe of the Rampa Rebellion and his martyrdom.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text describes the Rampa Rebellion as a militant guerrilla movement, detailing the strategy of attacking police stations to obtain weapons. The attack on the Chintapalli police station is specifically mentioned.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Rampa Rebellion later inspired similar movements among tribals in Odisha, demonstrating that the rebellion's influence extended beyond Andhra Pradesh. The statement incorrectly limits the rebellion's impact to a specific geographical area.


**8. With reference to Kazi Nazrul Islam, consider the following statements:**

1. Kazi Nazrul Islam, born in Churulia village, Burdwan district of West Bengal, joined the Indian Army in 1917 and left in 1920 to join the Bengali Muslim Literary Society.
2.  Nazrul Islam, known as the "Bidrohi Kobi" (Rebel Poet), wrote and composed over 2000 songs ("Nazrul Geeti"), many of which rebelled against oppression and tradition.
3.  His book "Pralayshikha" was banned in 1930, leading to sedition charges and imprisonment, but he was released following the 1931 Gandhi-Irwin Pact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text provides Nazrul Islam's birthplace, his service in the Indian Army, and his subsequent involvement with the Bengali Muslim Literary Society.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately describes Nazrul Islam as the "Bidrohi Kobi" and mentions his prolific output of songs, many of which challenged oppressive systems and traditions.

Statement 3 is also correct. The text details the banning of "Pralayshikha," the subsequent sedition charges, and his release following the Gandhi-Irwin Pact.  The statement accurately reflects a significant event in his life and career.



**9. With reference to Raja Ravi Varma, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Ravi Varma, born in Travancore Kilimanoor in 1848, was a pioneer of lithography in India, combining Indian traditions with European academic art techniques.
2.  He is known as the "Father of Modern Indian Art" and made affordable copies of his paintings available to the public, making him an "artist of the people".
3. He received the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal in 1904, but the title "Raja" was conferred by the British government, not Lord Curzon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes Ravi Varma's birthplace, his pioneering use of lithography in Indian art, and his fusion of Indian and European artistic styles.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly identifies him as the "Father of Modern Indian Art" and highlights his efforts to make his art accessible to the masses.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While he did receive the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal in 1904, the text states that the title "Raja" was conferred by Lord Curzon, not the British government as a whole.  The statement makes an incorrect attribution of the title's conferral.



**10. Consider the following statements:**

2.  Shankardev's contributions included the development of Ankiya Naat (Assamese one-act plays), Borgeets, Bhaonas, and Sattriya dance, significantly influencing Assamese culture.
3. Ahilyabai Holkar, an 18th-century Malwa queen, is credited with the restoration of various temples, including Kashi Vishwanath, but not Dwarka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes Shankardev's life, his religious philosophy (Ek-Sarana-Hari-Naam-Dharma), and his role as a social and religious reformer.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Shankardev's significant contributions to Assamese art forms, including Ankiya Naat, Borgeets, Bhaonas, and Sattriya dance, are accurately mentioned.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Ahilyabai Holkar's temple restoration work is mentioned, the text includes Dwarka among the temples she restored. The statement makes a false exclusion regarding her temple restoration projects.



**11. With reference to the Kudavolai system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kudavolai system, a method of village administration in ancient Tamil Nadu, was used to elect village representatives during the 10th century Chola era.
2.  The system involved dividing villages into wards, with each ward electing representatives through a lottery system using palm leaf tickets (volai) placed in a pot (kuda).
3. The Kudavolai system is documented in Utharamerur inscriptions, but its influence extended beyond Tamil Nadu to other parts of South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the Kudavolai system's origin in 10th-century Tamil Nadu and its function in electing village representatives.

Statement 2 is also correct. The description of the lottery system using palm leaf tickets and a pot, along with the ward-based division of villages, is accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions Utharamerur inscriptions as a source documenting the Kudavolai system, but it doesn't state that the system's influence extended beyond Tamil Nadu.  The statement expands the system's reach beyond verifiable evidence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's role in conducting mutual evaluations to assess countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures is accurately described.

Statement 2 is correct. India's achievement of an 'Outstanding Outcome' in its 2023-24 evaluation and its placement in the 'regular follow-up' category are accurately reported.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the text mentions the adoption of the MER, it states that the plenary session was held in Singapore, not Paris. The statement contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the location of the plenary session.


**13. With reference to  the  National Botanical Research Institute's research, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) has conducted research to preserve and produce flowers used in the rituals of the 12th-century Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha.
2. The Shree Jagannath Temple, constructed by Ananta Varman Chodaganga Deva of the Ganga dynasty, is known for its Kalinga architecture and its famous Rath Yatra festival.
3.  The NBRI's research focused solely on the preservation of the flowers used in the Rath Yatra festival and did not encompass other temple rituals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NBRI's research on preserving and producing ritual flowers for the Shree Jagannath Temple is accurately stated.

Statement 2 is correct. The information about the temple's construction, architectural style, and the Rath Yatra festival is all accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Rath Yatra is a significant festival, the text doesn't specify that the NBRI's research was limited to the flowers used only in that specific festival.  It is more likely that the research extended to other temple rituals as well. The statement imposes an unwarranted limitation on the scope of the research.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI's primary function is managing the country's gold reserves, with minimal involvement in monetary policy.
2.  The RBI Governor is appointed by the President of India for a fixed five-year term, without any possibility of extension.
3. The RBI is fully autonomous and independent of the Government of India in all its operational and policy decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI does manage a significant portion of India's foreign exchange reserves, which includes gold, its core mandate is far broader.  The RBI's primary functions include formulating and implementing monetary policy, regulating the banking system, managing the country's currency, and maintaining financial stability.  Gold reserves are a component of its overall responsibility for managing the nation's financial system, not its sole or even primary function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI Governor is appointed by the President of India in consultation with the Central Government. The term is not a fixed five years; it can be shorter or longer depending on various factors and the government's decision.  There is also the possibility of an extension of the term.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI enjoys a significant degree of autonomy, but it is not entirely independent of the Government of India. The RBI Act, 1934, and other governing legislation provide for governmental oversight and influence on certain aspects of the RBI's operations and policies.  The government appoints the Governor and other key officials, and the RBI is accountable to the Parliament through the government.  The RBI's autonomy is thus a relative concept, subject to legal and constitutional constraints.  A critical aspect of this relationship lies in the balance between maintaining price stability and supporting economic growth, a tension often navigated through consultation and negotiation between the RBI and the government.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI directly levies taxes on individuals and corporations to generate revenue.
2. The RBI's profits are entirely retained for its own operational expenses and capital investments.
3. The RBI exclusively manages the currency chests of public sector banks, excluding those of private sector banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI does not directly levy taxes.  Its primary sources of revenue are interest income on its investments (including government securities), and seigniorage (profit from issuing currency).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A significant portion of the RBI's profits are transferred to the Government of India as a dividend. This transfer is a crucial aspect of the RBI's relationship with the government, reflecting its role as a public institution.  While the RBI retains some profits for its operational needs and capital expenditure, it is not the entire amount.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI manages currency chests across both public and private sector banks.  The currency chests facilitate the efficient distribution and management of currency within the banking system, ensuring smooth functioning for all banks irrespective of their ownership structure.


**3. With reference to the RBI's relationship with the Government of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India appoints all members of the RBI's Central Board of Directors.
2. The RBI is legally bound to follow all policy directives issued by the Ministry of Finance without exception.
3. The RBI has no independent power to formulate its monetary policy; it operates solely under the direction of the Government of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Government of India plays a significant role in the appointment of the RBI's Central Board of Directors, including the Governor, it doesn't appoint *all* members. The board also includes other members with expertise from various sectors, appointed through a selection process which involves the government but also aims for a degree of independence and expertise.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI enjoys considerable autonomy in formulating and implementing monetary policy. While the government can issue directions on certain matters of public interest, the RBI is not legally bound to follow all directives without exception.  The RBI Act, 1934, establishes a framework where consultation and negotiation occur, but the RBI retains the capacity to make independent judgements, especially concerning monetary policy decisions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI has the legal authority to formulate and implement its monetary policy independently.  However, this autonomy is not absolute; the RBI's actions are subject to scrutiny and potential influence from the government, particularly in situations where monetary policy objectives might conflict with broader government economic goals. This complex interplay between autonomy and accountability is a key aspect of the RBI's relationship with the Government of India.  The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), for instance,  includes members nominated by the government, but the RBI Governor plays a crucial role, and the overall policy decisions are not dictated solely by the government.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI's role in managing India's balance of payments is primarily limited to providing data and analysis, with no direct intervention in foreign exchange markets.
2.  The RBI solely issues all banknotes in India, including the one-rupee note.
3. The RBI's primary objective is maximizing profits for the benefit of its shareholders.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI plays a crucial role in managing India's balance of payments through various interventions in the foreign exchange market, including buying and selling foreign currencies to influence the exchange rate. Data and analysis are certainly a part of its function, but the RBI directly intervenes to maintain stability and manage the country's foreign exchange reserves.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI issues all banknotes except the one-rupee note, which is issued by the Ministry of Finance.  This division of responsibility reflects historical practices and administrative convenience.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI's primary objectives are to maintain price stability, promote economic growth, and manage the nation's financial system. While profitability is important for its operational efficiency and ability to transfer surplus to the Government, profit maximization is not its primary or overriding goal.  The RBI's mandate is broader and encompasses several critical public policy objectives.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified instructions.  The questions aim for a "difficult" level, employing various distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's public debt:**

1.  India's general government debt-to-GDP ratio, as per the IMF, is projected to reach 100% of GDP by fiscal year 2028 under adverse circumstances.
2.  The FRBM Act of 2003 mandated a reduction of the general government debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% by 2024-25, a target that was not achieved.
3.  The Central government's debt liabilities are explicitly distinguished from those of state governments in India's fiscal reporting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. Statement 1 accurately reflects the IMF's projection of India's potential debt-to-GDP ratio under unfavorable economic conditions. Statement 2 correctly points out the FRBM Act's unfulfilled target for debt reduction by 2024-25.  Statement 3 is true; while the central and state governments' debts contribute to the overall public debt figure, the Union government maintains separate accounting for its own liabilities.  The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one of these verifiable facts.


**2. With reference to the Ministry of Finance's roles and responsibilities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission, which makes recommendations on the distribution of tax revenue between the central and state governments, is directly under the Department of Revenue within the Ministry of Finance.
2. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is responsible for preparing the Union Budget annually.
3. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for implementing the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), a national financial inclusion scheme.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. The Ministry of Finance does oversee and implement the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Finance Commission, while housed within the Ministry of Finance's broad purview, is constitutionally independent and doesn't directly report to the Department of Revenue.  Statement 2 is false;  the Union Budget is prepared by the Department of Economic Affairs and the Department of Revenue within the Ministry of Finance.  The CBIC focuses on indirect tax administration.


**3. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council's decisions require a three-fourths majority of the weighted votes of members present and voting, with the Union Finance Minister holding a casting vote in case of a tie.
2.  The Central GST (CGST) revenue is shared equally between the Central Government and the State Governments.
3.  The GST Network (GSTN), initially a not-for-profit company, is now a government company with 100% government shareholding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. Statement 1 accurately describes the decision-making process within the GST Council;  a three-fourths majority is needed, but there's no mention of a casting vote for the Finance Minister. Statement 3 correctly states the current ownership structure of GSTN. Statement 2 is incorrect; while CGST is collected by the central government, the revenue distribution is not always equal. A portion of CGST is devolved to the states as per the Finance Commission's recommendations.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning India's startup ecosystem:**

1.  The Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) scheme, established in 2016, provides capital directly to startups through grants and subsidies.
2. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) launched StartupShala, a flagship accelerator program focused on providing knowledge, networks, and funding to existing entrepreneurs.
3.  Companies can currently utilize Social Stock Exchanges (SSEs) to fulfill their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mandates by investing in non-profit organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  StartupShala is indeed a DPIIT initiative supporting existing entrepreneurs. Statement 1 is incorrect because FFS provides capital to SEBI-registered Alternative Investment Funds which then invest in startups, not directly to the startups themselves.  Statement 3 is false;  while companies can donate to non-profits outside of SSEs under CSR, they cannot currently use SSEs to fulfill their CSR obligations.  An amendment to the Companies Act is required for this.


**5. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI mandates Priority Sector Lending (PSL) with uniform targets for all types of banks in India (Scheduled Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks, and Small Finance Banks).

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only

The statement incorrectly emphasizes services imports over goods imports as the main factor.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1.  The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) includes members appointed by the Government of India, excluding the RBI Governor.
2.  The RBI's primary role is managing the nation's currency, including issuing banknotes (except the one-rupee note) and coins.
3.  The RBI solely regulates the Indian banking system, without any oversight from other government bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the government appoints some MPC members, the RBI Governor is also a member and chairs the committee.  The MPC's decisions on monetary policy are crucial for the RBI's functions.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's core mandate includes currency management, encompassing the issuance of banknotes (excluding the one-rupee note, which is issued by the Ministry of Finance) and coins.  This is a key function reflecting its role as the central bank.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the RBI is the primary regulator of the Indian banking system, it operates within a framework of government oversight.  The government's influence is evident in the appointment of the RBI Governor and other key officials, as well as the RBI's ultimate accountability to Parliament.  The Ministry of Finance also plays a significant role in the overall supervision of the financial system.  Therefore, the RBI's authority is not entirely independent of government influence.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMY exclusively provides credit to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) located in the North Eastern Region (NER).
2.  The investment limit for enterprises under PMMY is capped at Rs. 10 crore, regardless of turnover.

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PMMY's scope is not limited to the NER; it's a nationwide initiative aimed at providing credit to MSMEs across India.  While the NER might receive focused attention under various government programs, PMMY's reach is broader.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PMMY doesn't have a single investment limit of Rs. 10 crore for all enterprises.  The investment limits for MSMEs are categorized under different classifications (micro, small, medium) and these classifications have different investment and turnover limits.

Statement 3 is correct.  PMMY is designed to promote entrepreneurship, particularly among individuals who may lack access to traditional collateral-based lending. The scheme provides loans without requiring substantial collateral, making it accessible to a wider range of borrowers.


**3. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central GST (CGST) revenue is entirely retained by the Central Government, with no sharing with states.
2.  The State GST (SGST) revenue is shared equally between the Central and State Governments.
3.  The Interstate GST (IGST) revenue is distributed among states based on the origin of goods.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A portion of CGST revenue is devolved to states based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission.  The distribution is not a simple equal split, but rather a formula-based allocation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SGST revenue is credited entirely to the respective states' Consolidated Funds; it’s not shared with the Central Government.

Statement 3 is incorrect. IGST revenue is shared with states based on the *destination* of goods, not their origin. This is a crucial aspect of the GST system, aiming to avoid distortions caused by tax competition between states.  The distribution is based on a formula reflecting the consumption patterns within each state.


**4. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in Indian banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  A higher Gross Non-Performing Asset (GNPA) ratio indicates better asset quality and financial stability for a bank.

3.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, is primarily designed for resolving the insolvency of large corporations, excluding MSMEs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A higher GNPA ratio signifies a larger portion of a bank's loan portfolio is at risk of default, indicating weaker asset quality and potential financial distress. A lower GNPA ratio is indicative of a healthier bank.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SARFAESI Act streamlines the process for secured creditors to recover their dues by allowing them to take possession of collateral without necessarily needing a court order first.  Court intervention can still occur, but it is not a mandatory prerequisite.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IBC, 2016, is applicable to all insolvent entities, including MSMEs and large corporations.  The framework aims to provide a time-bound process for resolving insolvency regardless of the size of the business.


**5. With reference to the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements on agriculture, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The “peace clause” is a temporary, not permanent, solution to the PSH issue.  It was intended as an interim measure until a permanent solution could be reached, but has been extended several times due to lack of consensus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. De Minimis limits for price support subsidies differ between developing and developed countries, reflecting the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR).  Developing countries are generally allowed a higher limit.

Statement 3 is correct. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies explicitly aims to curb harmful fishing practices and includes a prohibition on subsidies for fishing on the unregulated high seas.  This is a key element of the agreement's objective to promote sustainable fisheries.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RDSS provides financial assistance for smart metering across various consumer categories, including rural, urban, industrial, and commercial, not exclusively for rural areas. The scheme prioritizes smart metering in areas with high AT&C losses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. RDSS specifically excludes private sector DISCOMs from receiving financial assistance. The scheme primarily targets government-owned DISCOMs to improve their operational efficiency and financial health.

Statement 3 is correct.  A core objective of RDSS is to reduce AT&C losses to a pan-India average of 12-15%, aiming to improve the efficiency and financial sustainability of the distribution sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The award of GCs under the GCP is contingent upon achieving a minimum tree density of 1100 trees per hectare.  This condition ensures the effectiveness of the tree plantation activities in enhancing green cover.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GCP functions under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, not the Energy Conservation Act, 2001. While carbon credits under CCTS are related to reducing emissions under the Energy Conservation Act, GCP has a broader environmental scope.

Statement 3 is correct.  ICFRE is designated as the GCP administrator, responsible for implementing, managing, monitoring, and operating the program.  This reflects the program's focus on forestry and its integration with existing forestry research and educational institutions.


**8. With reference to Statutory Bail in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Statutory bail is applicable to all offences, including those punishable by the death penalty.
2. The court is not required to provide written reasons for denying statutory bail.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Statutory bail does not apply to offences where the death penalty is a possible punishment.  This exception reflects the seriousness of such crimes and the need for a more thorough judicial assessment before release.

Statement 2 is incorrect. If a court denies statutory bail, it is obligated to provide written reasons for the refusal. This ensures transparency and allows for judicial review of the decision.

Statement 3 is correct.  Statutory bail is a legal provision that mandates the release of an undertrial from custody if the prosecution fails to complete the investigation or trial within a stipulated timeframe. This protects the rights of undertrials who might otherwise face prolonged detention without trial.


**9. With reference to Exit Polls in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Exit polls provide predictions about the outcome of elections based on voter surveys conducted after polling concludes.
2.  The Representation of the People Act, 1951, explicitly regulates the conduct of exit polls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Exit polls gauge public opinion by surveying voters after they have cast their ballots. These surveys aim to predict election outcomes but are not always accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Representation of the People Act, 1951, governs various aspects of elections, it doesn't explicitly regulate exit polls.  The regulation of exit polls is primarily governed by the Election Commission of India's guidelines, which often place restrictions on their publication before the conclusion of voting.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Exit polls, while not strictly regulated initially, are a more recent development in the Indian electoral system than 1957 and their use has only become common in recent decades.

Statement 2 is correct. The President appoints the Chairperson of the NHRC in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. The selection process reflects the importance given to upholding human rights standards.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NHRC's recommendations are not legally binding, although they carry significant moral weight and influence.  The government and other agencies are not obligated to accept them; however, non-compliance can damage their reputation.


**11. With reference to Article 3 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President is not required to refer the bill to the state legislature concerned.  While consultation might occur, it's not a mandatory step in the process under Article 3.  This reflects the Parliament's ultimate authority in matters of state reorganization.

Statement 3 is correct.  Article 3 explicitly allows the formation of new states by uniting two or more existing states. This power is a crucial element of the Constitution's flexibility in addressing evolving political and administrative needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Fourth Schedule is not related to the qualifications of MPs. Qualifications for MPs are prescribed elsewhere in the Constitution.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Fourth Schedule does not deal with the oath of office for the President.  The oath of office is specified in a different article of the Constitution.  The Fourth Schedule deals only with seat allocation in the Rajya Sabha.

Although the First Finance Commission laid the groundwork for differentiating between states, the explicit concept of SCS emerged later through various government policies and planning commission recommendations.  The categorization of states under SCS wasn't formally established by the First Finance Commission itself.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The list of states currently holding SCS is not limited to those listed.  The number and identity of states with SCS have changed over time, and the current list is subject to change based on government policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While SCS does provide enhanced financial assistance, it also involves special constitutional provisions in some cases (Articles 371 and its related clauses).  Therefore, it involves both financial and constitutional aspects.


**15. With reference to cooperative societies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The right to form cooperative societies is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.
2.  The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act primarily deals with the regulation of cooperative societies.
3. State governments have primary legislative control over cooperative societies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The right to form cooperative societies is not explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right in the Constitution.  While the Constitution promotes cooperative societies through its Directive Principles of State Policy, it does not guarantee this right under fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act deals with the constitution of cooperative societies, not their regulation.  The regulation of cooperative societies is primarily governed by state-level legislation.

Statement 3 is correct.  State governments primarily control the legislative framework governing cooperative societies within their respective jurisdictions.  This reflects the federal structure of India's governance, with states having greater autonomy in managing local matters.


**16. With reference to the Disaster Management Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. States can directly seek funds from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) without utilizing funds from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).
2. The NDRF is entirely funded by the Central Government.
3. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, establishes the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) as a constitutional body.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Disaster Management Act, 2005, mandates that states must first utilize funds from the SDRF before approaching the NDRF for additional assistance.  This ensures efficient resource allocation and prioritizes state-level preparedness.

Statement 2 is correct. The NDRF is exclusively funded by the Central Government, reflecting the central government's role in coordinating national disaster response efforts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NDMA is a statutory body, not a constitutional body, established under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.  The Act provides the legal framework for its establishment and functioning.


**17. With reference to the principle of 'Collective Responsibility' in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
2.  Ministers are individually accountable to the President for their actions.
3. The Prime Minister can dismiss any minister without the approval of Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The principle of collective responsibility holds the Council of Ministers collectively accountable to the Lok Sabha (House of the People).  A vote of no-confidence can lead to the resignation or dismissal of the entire council.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ministers are ultimately accountable to the Constitution, their primary accountability is to the Parliament, not directly to the President. The President acts as a constitutional head of state and does not directly hold ministers accountable.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Prime Minister's power to dismiss a minister is subject to certain constitutional norms and political realities.  While the Prime Minister has significant influence over the composition of the Council of Ministers, they cannot arbitrarily dismiss ministers without considering the overall political stability of the government.  Parliamentary approval is not a requirement, but the political consequences could be significant.



**18. With reference to the  "None of the Above" (NOTA) option in Indian elections, consider the following statements:**

1.  If NOTA receives the highest number of votes, the election in that constituency is declared void.
2.  The NOTA option was introduced to formally express rejection of all candidates.
3. The NOTA option was first used in the Kerala Legislative Assembly elections in 2013.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. If NOTA receives the most votes, the candidate with the second-highest number of votes is declared the winner. The election is not declared void; the NOTA option simply indicates voter dissatisfaction with available candidates.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NOTA option was introduced to provide voters with a formal mechanism to express their disapproval of all contesting candidates.  This allows voters to register their dissent without resorting to informal methods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NOTA option was introduced in 2013, it was not first used in Kerala.  The Supreme Court's order mandating NOTA was implemented gradually across different elections and states.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Article 265 of the Indian Constitution:**

1. Article 265 prohibits the levying of any tax except by the authority of law.
2.  The power to levy taxes under Article 265 is exclusively vested in the Union Parliament.
3. Article 265 is located within Part XII of the Constitution, dealing with the Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 265 explicitly states that "No tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law." This principle ensures that taxation is not arbitrary and is subject to legal constraints, preventing the state from imposing taxes without a valid legislative basis. This is a crucial safeguard against arbitrary taxation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Union Parliament has significant taxing powers, Article 265 doesn't restrict tax levy *exclusively* to the Union.  State legislatures also possess the power to levy taxes on subjects within their jurisdiction as outlined in the Seventh Schedule.  The distribution of tax powers between the Union and States is a complex issue governed by various articles of the Constitution, notably Articles 268, 269, 269A, and 270.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Article 265 is indeed part of Part XII of the Constitution, but Part XII deals with the *Union* and not specifically with *the Union's taxing powers*.  While the article relates to the Union's authority, its placement in Part XII doesn't directly define the scope of its application. The scope is determined by the text of Article 265 itself.


**2. With reference to the distribution of tax revenues in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 270 mandates that the net proceeds of certain taxes levied and collected by the Union shall be distributed between the Union and the States on the basis of population.
2. The Finance Commission, established under Article 280, plays a crucial role in recommending the principles governing the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and the States.
3. Articles 268, 269, and 269A deal with taxes levied and collected by the States but assigned to the Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 270 does deal with the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Union and the States, but it doesn't specify that distribution is solely based on population. The actual distribution is a complex process involving various factors considered by the Finance Commission, including population, but also other factors like area, income, and development needs of the states.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission, a crucial constitutional body responsible for recommending the principles governing the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and duties between the Union and the States.  The Commission's recommendations are crucial for maintaining fiscal balance and equity between the Centre and the States.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Articles 268, 269, and 269A deal with taxes levied and collected by the *Union* but assigned to the *States*.  This is the reverse of what statement 3 claims.  These articles reflect the sharing of tax revenues from specific sources, demonstrating the complex federal fiscal arrangement in India.


**3. With reference to Article 280 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 280 mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission every five years.
2. The Finance Commission's primary function is to advise the President on matters relating to the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States.
3. The recommendations of the Finance Commission are binding on the Union and State governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 280 mandates the appointment of a Finance Commission by the President every five years. This regular review of the financial relationship between the Union and States is essential for maintaining fiscal stability and equity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Finance Commission's primary function is to advise the President on financial matters concerning the Union and the States.  This includes recommending the principles governing the distribution of tax revenues, grants-in-aid, and other financial matters crucial for Centre-State relations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the Finance Commission’s recommendations carry immense weight, they are *not* binding on the Union and State governments.  The government may accept or reject the recommendations, but it is expected to provide reasons for rejection, demonstrating transparency and accountability.


**4. With reference to Article 301 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 301 guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce throughout the territory of India.
2. The freedom guaranteed under Article 301 applies only to interstate trade and commerce.
3.  The State can impose restrictions on trade and commerce under Article 301 only with the prior approval of the Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 301 guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce throughout the territory of India. This is a fundamental right ensuring the free flow of goods and services across state boundaries, promoting economic integration and efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The freedom guaranteed by Article 301 applies to both *interstate* and *intrastate* trade and commerce.  While interstate trade is explicitly mentioned, the overall principle extends to the freedom of trade and commerce within a state's boundaries as well.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Article 301 doesn't require prior parliamentary approval for the State to impose restrictions on trade and commerce. However, it allows the Parliament to impose restrictions on this freedom under Articles 302 to 305, which provide for the regulation of trade and commerce in the national interest.  These articles empower the Parliament to enact legislation that may restrict the freedom of trade and commerce, subject to judicial scrutiny.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the provisions related to the formation of new states in the Indian Constitution:**

1. Article 2 of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to admit new states into the Union.
2. Article 3 of the Constitution enables the Parliament to form new states by separating territory from any existing state.
3.  A bill concerning the formation of a new state under Article 3 requires the prior recommendation of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 2 of the Constitution deals with the *admission of new States* into the Indian Union.  This is different from the *formation of new States* from existing ones, which is covered under Article 3.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 explicitly empowers the Parliament to form new states or alter the areas, boundaries, or names of existing states. This provision reflects the dynamic nature of state boundaries and the power of the Parliament to reorganize them.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 3 mandates that a bill related to the formation of a new state or any alteration of existing states requires the prior recommendation of the President before it can be introduced in Parliament. This emphasizes the gravity of such decisions and ensures that they are considered carefully by the highest executive authority.


**6. With reference to the National Emergency in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Part XVIII of the Constitution deals with emergency provisions, including National Emergency.
2. The President can declare a National Emergency only on the grounds of war or external aggression.
3.  During a National Emergency, the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression (Article 19) is automatically suspended.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Part XVIII of the Constitution of India deals with emergency provisions, including the National Emergency (Article 352), President's Rule (Article 356), and Financial Emergency (Article 360).  These provisions outline the circumstances under which the normal functioning of the Constitution can be temporarily suspended or modified to address exceptional situations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although war or external aggression are grounds for declaring a National Emergency, they are not the only grounds.  The President can also declare such an emergency if there is a threat to the security of India or any part of it, whether from internal disturbances or otherwise.  This broader interpretation allows the government to respond to a wider range of threats.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While a National Emergency can lead to the suspension of fundamental rights, it doesn't automatically suspend *all* fundamental rights.  The suspension of fundamental rights is done through a separate order by the President, and even then, certain fundamental rights (like Articles 20 and 21) cannot be suspended.  The extent of suspension depends on the specific circumstances and the government's assessment of the threat.  The Supreme Court's role in judicial review also plays a significant part in limiting the scope of such suspensions.


**7. With reference to the Pro-tem Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The office of the Pro-tem Speaker is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.
2. The Pro-tem Speaker's primary duty is to administer the oath of office to newly elected Members of Parliament.
3.  The Pro-tem Speaker is appointed by the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only



**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not explicitly mention the office of the Pro-tem Speaker. The existence and functions of this office are established through convention and parliamentary practice.  It's a temporary office with specific functions during the initial stages of a new Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct.  The primary duty of the Pro-tem Speaker is to administer the oath of office to the newly elected Members of Parliament (MPs).  This is a crucial initial step in formally constituting the Lok Sabha.  This role is essential to establish the legitimacy of the new parliament.


Statement 3 is correct. The Pro-tem Speaker is appointed by the President of India from amongst the senior-most members of the Lok Sabha.  The President's role in this appointment emphasizes the executive's role in the initial stages of Parliament's formation.


**8. With reference to the Postal Services in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Postal services are listed under the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Indian Postal Department contributes significantly to financial inclusion in India.
3.  The Telecommunications Act, 2023, repealed the existing legal framework governing postal services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Postal services in India fall under the Union List (and not the Concurrent List) in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution. This means that the Union Parliament has exclusive legislative power over this subject.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian Postal Department, through its extensive network, plays a significant role in financial inclusion by providing access to various financial services, especially in rural and remote areas.  This includes facilitating money transfers, providing banking services, and distributing government benefits.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, primarily focuses on telecommunications and does not repeal the legal framework governing postal services.  Postal services continue to be governed by separate legislation.


**9. With reference to the Oath or Affirmation of Members of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The oath or affirmation can be taken in any of the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.
2.  If a Member of Parliament fails to take the oath or affirmation within a specified time, their seat may be declared vacant.
3.  The oath or affirmation is administered by the President of India before the commencement of each session of Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Members of Parliament can take the oath or affirmation in any of the languages included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. This reflects India's linguistic diversity and ensures that MPs can participate in the constitutional process in their preferred language.

Statement 2 is correct.  If an MP fails to take the oath or affirmation within the prescribed time, their seat can be declared vacant. This provision ensures that only those who are willing to abide by the constitutional framework are part of the legislature.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The oath or affirmation is administered by the Pro-tem Speaker (in the first sitting of a newly elected Lok Sabha) or the Speaker, before the commencement of each session of Parliament, but it's not administered by the President.  The President only administers the oath to the Pro-tem Speaker.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Census in India:**

1.  The first complete census of India was conducted in 1881.
2.  The Census Act of 1948 provides the legal framework for conducting the census.
3. The census data is used exclusively for administrative purposes by the Government of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first complete census of India was conducted in 1881, not 1871.  While attempts were made before 1881, the 1881 census is considered the first comprehensive and nationwide effort.

Statement 2 is correct. The Census Act of 1948 provides the legal basis for conducting the decennial census in India.  This act outlines the procedures, responsibilities, and legal framework for data collection and dissemination.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Census data is used for a wide range of purposes beyond mere administration. It is used for planning, policy formulation, academic research, and by various private entities for market analysis and other purposes.  The data is crucial for understanding demographic trends and is a valuable resource for both public and private sector decision-making.  However, its use is subject to privacy regulations to protect individual data.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements about the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government:**

1.  The NDA government, led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was the first coalition government in India to complete its full five-year term.
2.  The NDA government's tenure saw the launch of the National Highway Development Programme (NHDP), a significant infrastructure initiative.
3.  Atal Bihari Vajpayee's leadership significantly influenced electoral behaviour, leading to a new era of coalition politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee did complete its full term (1999-2004), it wasn't the *first* coalition government to do so.  Several earlier governments, though shorter-lived, had also completed their terms.  The question plays on the common misconception that the NDA was the pioneer of stable coalition rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The NHDP was a landmark initiative launched during Vajpayee's tenure, significantly expanding and improving India's national highway network. This is a well-known fact easily verifiable.

Statement 3 is partially correct but presented in a misleading manner.  Vajpayee's leadership undeniably impacted electoral behaviour, but attributing a completely "new era of coalition politics" solely to him is an overstatement. Coalition governments existed before his time. The statement tries to establish a direct causal link between Vajpayee's actions and a sweeping change in the political landscape, which is a simplification.


**2. With reference to the NOTA (None of the Above) option in Indian elections, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NOTA option was introduced nationwide in 2013, simultaneously with the implementation of electronic voting machines (EVMs).
2.  If NOTA receives the highest number of votes in a constituency, the election is declared void, and a re-poll is conducted.
3.  The NOTA button is strategically placed at the top of the candidate list on EVMs to ensure high visibility and encourage its use.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NOTA option was first introduced in 2013 but only in four states (Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh) and the union territory of Delhi. Its nationwide implementation came later.  The statement attempts to link NOTA's introduction with EVMs, a chronologically false connection.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  If NOTA receives the most votes, the candidate with the second-highest number of votes is declared the winner. The election is not voided; the system ensures a winner is declared even if voters predominantly reject all candidates.  This statement presents a false consequence of a high NOTA vote count.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NOTA button is located at the *bottom* of the candidate list on EVMs, not at the top. The placement is designed to be less prominent than the candidates themselves. This is a straightforward factual error designed as a distractor.



**3. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC was established in 1993 based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission,  a body focused on tribal welfare.
2. The NHRC has the power to summon witnesses, examine them under oath, and issue commissions for the examination of witnesses or documents.
3.  The NHRC's jurisdiction extends to all human rights violations, irrespective of whether the perpetrators are government officials or private citizens.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC was established in 1993 in accordance with the Paris Principles, not the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission. The Dhebar Commission dealt with tribal welfare, a separate issue. This statement creates confusion by linking the NHRC to a different commission with a similar timeframe.

Statement 2 is correct. The NHRC possesses the powers of a civil court, including summoning witnesses, administering oaths, and issuing commissions for document examination.  This is a direct factual recall question.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NHRC's mandate is broad, its jurisdiction primarily focuses on human rights violations committed by *state actors* (government officials, police, etc.).  It can investigate private citizen actions only if they are connected to state action or a pattern of human rights abuses. This statement overstates the NHRC's scope of action.


**4. With reference to Article 3 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 3 allows Parliament to create new states only by separating territory from existing states.
2.  Before recommending a bill under Article 3, the President must consult the state legislatures concerned, but their views are not binding.
3.  Article 3 empowers Parliament to alter the names of states but not to diminish their area.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 3 grants Parliament broader powers than just separating territory. It allows the creation of new states by uniting two or more states or parts of states, or by uniting any territory to a part of any state. This statement incorrectly limits the scope of Article 3.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 mandates that the President consult state legislatures before recommending a bill, but the President (and, by extension, Parliament) is not bound by their opinion. This is a specific and potentially confusing detail of the Article.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Article 3 explicitly allows Parliament to both alter the names of states *and* to diminish their area. This is a direct contradiction of the statement, designed as a strong distractor.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Council of Ministers:**

1. The total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, cannot exceed 15% of the total strength of the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament.
3.  The Prime Minister appoints all ministers, including those in the Cabinet, without needing Presidential assent.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 15% limit on the size of the Council of Ministers applies to the total membership of the *Lok Sabha*, not the Rajya Sabha. This statement interchanges key data points to create confusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the *Lok Sabha*, the lower house of Parliament, not the Rajya Sabha. This is a fundamental concept of the Indian parliamentary system, making this a crucial distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister advises the President on ministerial appointments, the President formally appoints the ministers.  The statement removes the President's role, a significant constitutional detail.


**6. With reference to the Disaster Management Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates that states must first utilize funds from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) before seeking assistance from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).
2.  States contribute 50% of the funds to the SDRF, with the remaining 50% coming from the Central Government.
3.  The Act allows the use of funds from the NDRF and SDRF for any purpose deemed necessary by state governments in times of crisis.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act states that states utilize funds from the SDRF *first*, then seek assistance from the NDRF if the SDRF is insufficient. The statement reverses the order of fund utilization, a critical detail for disaster management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. States contribute 25% to the SDRF (10% for special category states), with the Centre providing the remaining 75% or 90%. The statement provides an incorrect percentage contribution from states.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Funds from the NDRF and SDRF can only be used for response and management of *notified disasters*. The statement removes this crucial restriction, highlighting the importance of understanding the legal framework of disaster relief.


**7. With reference to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker is elected by a two-thirds majority of the Lok Sabha members.
2. A motion of no-confidence can be moved against the Speaker with a notice period of 7 days.
3. The Speaker's salary is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Speaker is elected by a *simple majority* of the Lok Sabha members, not a two-thirds majority. This statement alters a fundamental aspect of the Speaker's election process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A motion of no-confidence against the Speaker requires a 14-day notice period, not 7 days. This is a specific detail that tests factual recall.

Statement 3 is correct. The Speaker's salary is uniquely drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India, unlike other MPs whose salaries are determined by a separate statute. This fact highlights the Speaker's unique position within the parliamentary system.


**8. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS was first recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission in 1989.
2.  Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand are among the states currently enjoying SCS.
3.  The granting of SCS is based solely on the population density of a state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The concept of SCS was first recommended by the *Fifth* Finance Commission in 1969, not the Tenth Finance Commission in 1989.  The incorrect commission number and year serve as a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The listed states are indeed among those that have historically been granted SCS.  This statement tests factual recall of specific states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Population density is only one of several factors considered while granting SCS. Other factors include tribal population, socio-economic backwardness, and geographical disadvantages. This statement reduces the complexity of the SCS criteria to a single factor.


**9. With reference to Cooperative Societies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, made the formation of cooperative societies a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(c).
2.  Cooperative societies are primarily regulated by the Central Government, ensuring uniformity across states.
3.  The 97th Amendment Act aimed to restructure and strengthen cooperative societies in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 97th Amendment Act did indeed make the right to form cooperative societies a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(c). This tests direct factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cooperative societies primarily fall under the State List in the Constitution, giving state governments the primary regulatory power.  This statement shifts the regulatory authority from the states to the Centre, a crucial difference.

Statement 3 is correct. The 97th Amendment aimed at restructuring and strengthening cooperative societies. This is a well-known fact about the amendment.


**10. With reference to the President's oath of office, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's oath of office is mentioned in Article 60 of the Constitution.
2. The oath of office to the President is administered by the Vice-President of India.
3.  The President's oath of office emphasizes upholding the Constitution and the law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 60 of the Constitution does indeed prescribe the oath of office for the President. This is a straightforward factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The oath is administered by the Chief Justice of India, not the Vice-President. This is a key detail that differentiates the roles.

Statement 3 is correct. The President's oath explicitly emphasizes upholding the Constitution and the law of the land.  This is a factual recall question focusing on the content of the oath.


These ten questions demonstrate the creation of difficult and conceptually challenging MCQs based on the provided text, incorporating various distractors and testing different cognitive skills while maintaining a factual basis and avoiding any reference to the source material itself.  The explanations offer detailed insights into the reasoning behind the correct and incorrect options, aligning with UPSC exam expectations.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require accurate factual recall and analytical skills.


**1.  With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can pardon sentences for offenses under both Union and State laws.
2.  The President's power to grant mercy petitions is absolute and not subject to judicial review.
3.  The Supreme Court can review decisions on mercy petitions if there are procedural irregularities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President can only pardon sentences for offenses under Union laws; Governors have the power to pardon sentences for offenses under State laws.  This division of power is a crucial aspect of India's federal structure.  The President's power is not absolute, as implied by statement 2. While discretionary, the Supreme Court has the power to review decisions on mercy petitions, especially if there are procedural irregularities or violations of fundamental rights, as correctly stated in statement 3.  This judicial review acts as a check on executive power, upholding the principle of the rule of law.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the distribution of pardoning powers and the scope of judicial review in this context.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 265 prohibits all taxes except those imposed by the Union government.
2. Article 280 mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission every five years.
3. Article 301 guarantees the freedom of trade, commerce, and intercourse throughout the territory of India, subject to certain limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 265 prohibits the levying of taxes except by the authority of law.  It doesn't restrict the power solely to the Union government; both the Union and States can levy taxes, subject to constitutional provisions. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Article 280 provides for the establishment of a Finance Commission, but it doesn't specify a fixed five-year interval; the frequency is determined by the President. Statement 3 is correct. Article 301 does indeed guarantee freedom of trade, commerce, and intercourse, but this freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions that might be imposed by Parliament under Articles 302-305.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate, making option (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) misinterpret the scope and application of the cited articles.


**3. With reference to the process of renaming a state in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India can unilaterally change the name of any state.
2.  A bill to change a state's name requires prior presidential recommendation and consultation with the state legislature concerned.
3.  The state legislature's views on a name change are binding on Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President doesn't have the unilateral power to change a state's name. This power rests with Parliament, as per Article 3.  Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 clearly stipulates that a bill to alter a state's name (or boundaries) requires a prior recommendation from the President, who must consult the affected state legislature before making the recommendation. However, the state legislature's opinion is not binding on Parliament; it is merely a consultative process, as highlighted in statement 3.  Therefore, only statement 2 is completely accurate. The other options incorrectly attribute powers to the President and misrepresent the role of the state legislature in the process.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the National Anthem of India:**

1.  Singing the National Anthem is a fundamental right under Article 51A.
2.  Intentionally obstructing the singing of the National Anthem is punishable by up to five years imprisonment under the National Honour Act, 1971.
3.  'Jana Gana Mana' was first sung in 1911 at the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Showing respect to the National Anthem is a fundamental *duty*, not a right, under Article 51A.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The National Honour Act, 1971, prescribes a maximum punishment of up to three years imprisonment or a fine, or both, not five years.  Statement 3 is correct; 'Jana Gana Mana' was indeed first sung publicly in 1911 at the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress. Thus, only statement 3 is accurate.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly describe the legal status of singing the National Anthem and the penalties for obstructing it.


**5. With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly mentions the post of Speaker pro tem.
2.  The primary duty of the Speaker pro tem is administering oaths to newly elected MPs.
3.  An MP who fails to take the oath within the prescribed time automatically forfeits their seat.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not explicitly mention the post of Speaker pro tem; however, its existence and procedure are detailed in official parliamentary handbooks. Statement 2 is correct. The Speaker pro tem's main function is indeed administering oaths to newly elected MPs before the election of the regular Speaker. Statement 3 is incorrect. While failure to take the oath within the prescribed time can lead to a seat being declared vacant, it's not an automatic forfeiture; there's a process involved. Therefore, only statement 2 is fully correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the constitutional basis for the Speaker pro tem and the consequences of not taking the oath.


**6. With reference to the Census in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The first complete census was conducted in 1871.
2. The Census of India is conducted under the provisions of the Census Act of 1948.
3. The initial purpose of the census under British rule was primarily to facilitate social welfare programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While censuses were attempted from 1871, the first *complete* census was conducted in 1881. Statement 2 is correct. The Census Act of 1948 provides the legal framework for conducting the census. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Under British rule, the primary aim of the census was to assess revenue and taxation needs, not social welfare programs. Social welfare considerations became more prominent later. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the chronology and original purpose of the Indian census.


**7.  With reference to the Indian Emergency of 1975, consider the following statements:**

1. The state of emergency was declared by the then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
2.  The grounds for the declaration were external aggression and internal disturbance.
3. The Emergency was in force until March 1977.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Indira Gandhi advised the President to declare the Emergency, the formal declaration was made by the President, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1975 Emergency was declared on the grounds of "internal disturbance," not external aggression.  External aggression was the reason for the earlier emergencies of 1962 and 1971. Statement 3 is correct. The Emergency was indeed revoked in March 1977. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain factual errors about the actors and the justification for the declaration of the 1975 Emergency.


**8. With reference to the Prime Minister of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is the head of state.
2. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President.
3. The Prime Minister chairs the Planning Commission.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President is the head of state; the Prime Minister is the head of government. Statement 2 is correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, usually the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Lok Sabha. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Prime Minister chairs the NITI Aayog, not the Planning Commission (which was abolished). Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. The other options incorrectly identify the roles and responsibilities of the Prime Minister.


**9. With reference to the role of the Governor in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the Prime Minister.
2. The Governor can unilaterally dismiss a state's Chief Minister.
3. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor can recommend the dismissal of a Chief Minister, the final decision rests with the President.  Statement 3 is correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, meaning the President can dismiss the Governor at any time.  Only statement 3 is entirely correct. The other options incorrectly depict the appointment and dismissal procedures for Governors.



**10. With reference to the  Post Office Act (2023), consider the following statements:**

1. Postal services in India are under the Concurrent List of the Constitution.
2. The Act repeals the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.
3. Post offices in India now offer various financial services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Postal services fall under the Union List, not the Concurrent List.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Post Office Act 2023 amends and consolidates postal laws, it does not repeal the 1898 act entirely. Statement 3 is correct.  Post offices have diversified their services to include financial services, promoting financial inclusion. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The other options misrepresent the constitutional location of postal services and the impact of the 2023 Act.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members, while the Deputy Speaker is elected by the Rajya Sabha.
2. Article 93 mandates the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, but doesn't specify the selection process.
3. Conventionally, the Speaker is from the ruling party and the Deputy Speaker from the opposition, although exceptions exist.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because both the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker are elected by the Lok Sabha itself, not the Rajya Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha has its own Chairman and Deputy Chairman.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 93 of the Indian Constitution stipulates the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha. However, the detailed procedure for their election is laid down in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, not in the Constitution itself.  The Constitution only directs that the election should take place "as soon as may be". This allows for flexibility in the election process.

Statement 3 is correct.  While the convention is that the Speaker comes from the ruling party or coalition and the Deputy Speaker from the opposition, this is merely a convention, not a constitutional mandate. The provided text itself cites exceptions to this practice, notably the first four Deputy Speakers being from the ruling Congress party.  This highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of parliamentary conventions.  The absence of a Deputy Speaker in the 17th Lok Sabha further underscores the non-mandatory nature of this convention.


**2. With reference to the PESA Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. The PESA Act extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution to the 6th Scheduled Areas.
2.  The Act grants tribal communities complete ownership of all natural resources within their areas.
3. The Act aims to empower Gram Sabhas in the management of local affairs in Scheduled Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PESA Act, 1996 (Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996) extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution (relating to Panchayats) to the 5th Scheduled Areas, not the 6th. The 6th Schedule deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states of Northeast India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the PESA Act grants tribal communities significant control over the management and utilization of natural resources, it doesn't grant them complete ownership. The exact extent of control varies and is subject to the specific provisions of the Act and other applicable laws.  The Act emphasizes the role of Gram Sabhas in decision-making regarding these resources.

Statement 3 is correct.  A core objective of the PESA Act is to empower Gram Sabhas (village assemblies) in Scheduled Areas, giving them a crucial role in local governance and the management of resources. The Act seeks to ensure that the Panchayati Raj system respects the traditional governance structures and customs of tribal communities. This is a crucial aspect of ensuring that decentralization truly benefits the intended beneficiaries.


**3. With reference to the President's address to Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's address to both Houses of Parliament is mandatory at the beginning of each session.
2. Article 87 outlines the instances when the President addresses Parliament, including after general elections.
3. The practice of the President addressing Parliament was established before India's independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The President's address to both Houses is *not* mandatory at the beginning of *every* session.  It's mandated at the beginning of the first session after each general election to the Lok Sabha and at the commencement of the first session of each year. This is a crucial distinction because it shows that the address is tied to specific events and not a routine requirement.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 87 of the Constitution of India details the President's power to address Parliament.  It specifies that this address occurs at the commencement of each session after a general election and at the commencement of the first session of each year.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that the practice of the President addressing Parliament was established *after* the promulgation of the Constitution of India in 1950, with President Rajendra Prasad delivering the first address on January 31, 1950.  The text further notes that there was no such address to the Constituent Assembly between 1947 and 1950. This detail illustrates the evolution of parliamentary procedure post-independence.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution:**

1. Part XIX of the Constitution deals with emergency provisions.
2.  India has experienced four instances of the proclamation of a National Emergency under Article 352.
3. A Financial Emergency under Article 360 has never been proclaimed in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Part XVIII, not Part XIX, of the Indian Constitution deals with emergency provisions. This seemingly minor detail highlights the importance of precise knowledge of constitutional articles and their placement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions only three instances of the proclamation of a National Emergency under Article 352.  The inaccuracy in this statement serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of historical facts.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly states that a Financial Emergency under Article 360 has never been declared in India. This fact is important because it indicates a significant aspect of India's constitutional history, showcasing the country's avoidance of this extreme measure.


**5. With reference to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker's election is governed by Article 93, which details the specific procedure.
2. In the absence of both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, the senior-most member presides.
3.  The Speaker is the constitutional head of the Lok Sabha, but not the ceremonial head.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 93 provides for the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, the detailed procedure is outlined in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, not within Article 93 itself. The Constitution only directs that the election should happen "as soon as may be".

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that in the absence of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker discharges their functions.  The text does not specify the procedure for when both are absent. While the senior-most member might preside in such a scenario, it's not explicitly stated in the provided text. This ambiguity makes this a plausible distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Lok Sabha Speaker is both the constitutional *and* ceremonial head of the House.  This is a significant fact, reflecting the Speaker's dual role in upholding both the legal framework and the traditions of the Lok Sabha.


**6. With reference to Parliamentary Privileges, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha is chaired by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
2. Parliamentary Privileges are special rights and immunities granted exclusively to the Rajya Sabha.
3.  The Committee of Privileges of the Rajya Sabha consists of 15 members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, appoints the Chairman of the Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha. This highlights the independent functioning of the two Houses of Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Parliamentary Privileges extend to both Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and their members. They are not exclusive to the Rajya Sabha.  The statement attempts to mislead the candidate by focusing solely on the Rajya Sabha.

Statement 3 is correct. The Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha indeed comprises 15 members, nominated by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.  This accurately reflects the composition and formation of this important parliamentary committee.



**7. With reference to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Amendment Act added Part IX-A to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats.
2. The 74th Amendment Act added the 12th Schedule to the Constitution, listing functions of municipalities.
3.  Both Acts came into force in 1992, introducing democratic decentralization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act added Part IX, not Part IX-A, to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayats.  Part IX-A was added by another amendment.

Statement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act did add the 12th Schedule to the Constitution, listing the 18 functional items of municipalities. This is a significant detail, highlighting the specific provisions made for urban local governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Both Acts came into force in 1993, not 1992.  This subtle difference tests the candidate's precise recall of the timeline of constitutional amendments.


**8. With reference to the National Development Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee report, in the late 1950s, recommended the formation of the National Development Council.
2. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1993 implemented the Panchayat system at the grassroots level.
3. The National Development Council's primary focus is on rural development planning.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee report, in the early 1950s (not late 1950s), recommended the formation of a democratic system of governance at the grassroots level, leading to the establishment of the Panchayati Raj system.  The National Development Council was already in existence.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1993 did indeed implement the Panchayat system in rural areas to facilitate development at the grassroots level.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the National Development Council (NDC) plays a role in rural development, its scope is broader, encompassing national development planning and coordination across various sectors.  The statement presents a narrow and misleading view of the NDC's functions.


**9.  Consider the following statements about the High Seas Treaty:**

1. The High Seas Treaty will enter into force when ratified by at least 50 countries.
2. India signed and ratified the High Seas Treaty in 2023.
3. The High Seas are areas of the world's oceans beyond national jurisdiction.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The High Seas Treaty requires ratification by at least 60 countries, not 50, to come into force. This seemingly small numerical difference can be a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. India did indeed sign and ratify the High Seas Treaty in 2023.

Statement 3 is correct. The High Seas are accurately defined as those areas of the world's oceans that lie outside national jurisdictions.  This is a fundamental concept in international maritime law.


**10. With reference to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, consider the following statements:**

1. Port Blair, the capital city, is located in the North Andaman.
2. The Ten Degree Channel separates the Andaman Islands from the Nicobar Islands.
3. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a part of the  5th scheduled area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Port Blair is located in the South Andaman, not the North Andaman. This detail tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical specifics of the islands.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Eight Degree Channel, not the Ten Degree Channel, separates the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This is a crucial geographical detail that differentiates the two island groups.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are not part of the 5th scheduled area. The 5th schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Tribes in certain areas.  This serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the administrative classifications of different regions.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1.  Consider the following statements about Assam:**

1.  The Rangagora Tea Estate in Assam is known for its unique variety of  Assam tea.
2.  The Ojapali theatrical form, characterized by its musical and narrative structure, originated in the Brahmaputra Valley, Assam.
3.  Assam's tea production is significantly influenced by the monsoonal rainfall patterns, locally termed "Tea Showers."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rangagora Tea Estate exists in Assam, the statement implies a unique tea variety specifically associated with this estate, which is not consistently supported by readily available information. Assam is known for various tea varieties, but  pinpointing one to a single estate is an overstatement.

Statement 2 is correct. Ojapali is indeed a traditional theatrical form of Assam, originating in the Brahmaputra Valley.  Its distinctive blend of music, dance, and narrative makes it a significant part of Assamese cultural heritage. This is a well-documented fact.

Statement 3 is correct. The monsoonal rains in Assam, particularly the localized showers known as "Tea Showers," are crucial for tea cultivation in the region. These timely rains are vital for the growth and quality of the tea leaves.  The unique climatic conditions of Assam contribute significantly to the quality and flavour of its tea.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the geographical and cultural aspects of Assam:**

1. The Neo-Vaishnavite movement, a significant religious and social reform movement, significantly impacted the cultural landscape of Assam, but originated in the neighboring state of Manipur.
2. The Dayabhaga school of Hindu law, known for its distinct approach to inheritance, is primarily prevalent in Assam's eastern regions.
3.  The Brahmaputra Valley, encompassing a significant portion of Assam, is characterized by fertile alluvial soil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Neo-Vaishnavite movement, spearheaded by figures like Sankardeva and Madhavadeva, did profoundly influence Assam's culture and society. However, it originated *within* Assam, not Manipur.  Attributing its origin to Manipur is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Dayabhaga school of Hindu law is influential in parts of India,  it's an oversimplification to say it's *primarily* prevalent in Assam's eastern regions. The statement attempts to create a regional specificity that doesn't accurately reflect the broader application of the Dayabhaga school.

Statement 3 is correct. The Brahmaputra Valley is renowned for its fertile alluvial soil, deposited by the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries. This fertile land is a cornerstone of Assam's agricultural economy, supporting the cultivation of rice, tea, and other crops. This is a widely acknowledged geographical fact.


**3. With reference to Assam, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ahom kingdom, a powerful historical entity, was established in the Brahmaputra Valley and its influence extended beyond Assam, but the state is not named after the Ahoms.
2.  The Partition of Bengal (1905) directly resulted in the creation of Assam as a separate administrative unit.
3.  The Sylhet district, historically a part of Assam, is currently located within the borders of Bangladesh.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ahom kingdom was indeed a powerful force in the Brahmaputra Valley, leaving a lasting impact on Assam's history and culture.  The name "Assam" is, however, etymologically linked to the Ahoms, making the statement's assertion incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Partition of Bengal (1905) had significant consequences for the region, but it did not directly lead to the creation of Assam as a separate administrative unit. This is a misleading statement playing on the temporal proximity of events. Assam's administrative history is more complex.

Statement 3 is correct. The Sylhet district was indeed part of Assam historically, but after the partition of India and Bangladesh, it became part of Bangladesh. This is a well-established historical geographical fact.


**4. With reference to the geographical features of Assam, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dhansiri River forms a significant portion of Assam's western boundary,  while the Barak River forms a significant part of its southern boundary.
2.  The highest peak in Assam is located within the Dihing Patkai National Park.
3. The Barak Bhuban Wildlife Sanctuary is primarily located in the Brahmaputra Valley.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Dhansiri River is in Assam, it doesn’t form a significant part of Assam's western boundary. The Barak River does form a significant part of Assam's southern boundary. The statement attempts to confuse the examinee by presenting a partially correct statement with an incorrect component.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement is misleading because it doesn't specify the highest peak's exact location within the park.  While Dihing Patkai National Park is mountainous, the highest peak in Assam is located elsewhere.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Samudragupta's empire was vast, there's no conclusive archaeological evidence definitively placing it within the geographical boundaries of present-day Afghanistan.  His conquests primarily focused on the Indian subcontinent.

Statement 2 is correct. The discovery of Asokan inscriptions in Afghanistan proves early Indian influence, predating the later Kushan expansion. These inscriptions highlight the reach of the Mauryan empire's administrative and cultural influence.

Statement 3 is largely correct. While the British East India Company did have ambitions beyond trade, their military forays into Afghanistan were largely driven by strategic considerations related to securing trade routes, particularly through the Khyber Pass.  Their attempts at establishing lasting political control were ultimately unsuccessful and short-lived.  Therefore, the statement accurately reflects the primary focus of these operations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Agnipath scheme does indeed allow for the recruitment of candidates aged between 17.5 and 21 years for a four-year tenure.  The upper age limit of 23 is incorrect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the financial assistance under PMAY-Gramin is around ₹1.20 lakh, the amount varies based on the location (plain vs. hilly states). The statement presents an oversimplification and is therefore inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The VGF Scheme is indeed primarily used to support projects related to offshore wind energy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ULLAS-NILP doesn't solely rely on traditional methods; it also incorporates modern and flexible approaches to adult education.



These questions aim for a high difficulty level by requiring specific knowledge of the topics, incorporating subtle inaccuracies within the statements, and offering closely related distractors.  Remember that the difficulty level is subjective and can vary depending on the examinee's preparation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.

**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMAY-U aims to provide housing units to all eligible urban beneficiaries by 2024, excluding those owning a pucca house anywhere in India.  The scheme provides a central assistance of ₹1.5 lakh for each beneficiary under the In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) vertical.
2.  The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) vertical of PMAY-U is a state-sponsored scheme offering affordable loans to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Low Income Groups (LIG), and Middle Income Groups (MIG) with annual household incomes up to ₹18 lakh.  Beneficiary identification utilizes Aadhaar or Aadhaar Virtual ID.
3.  The PMAY-U scheme mandates Third Party Quality Monitoring (TPQM) and Social Audits for all housing projects.  Furthermore, the scheme's funding mechanism involves a 60% contribution from public expenditure and a 40% contribution from private investment and beneficiary contributions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. PMAY-U does aim to provide housing to eligible urban families by December 2024, and excludes those already owning pucca houses. However, the central assistance amount of ₹1.5 lakh is incorrect; it's for AHP and BLC verticals, not ISSR (which receives ₹1.0 lakh).  Despite this inaccuracy, the statement is still closer to the truth than the other options.

Statement 2 is incorrect on multiple counts. CLSS is a *central sector* scheme, not state-sponsored. While it does provide affordable loans,  the income eligibility criteria of up to ₹18 lakh is incorrect; MIG eligibility is capped at ₹18 lakh under CLSS but the other verticals are available to EWS. The Aadhaar/Aadhaar Virtual ID usage for beneficiary identification is correct.

Statement 3 is incorrect regarding the funding mechanism. The funding split is actually 40% public expenditure and 60% private investment and beneficiary contribution. The TPQM and Social Audits are correctly mentioned.

Therefore, only Statement 1 contains the most accurate information, making (a) the correct answer.  The other options misrepresent crucial facts about funding, sponsorship, and financial assistance amounts.


**2. With reference to the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0, consider the following statements:**

1. AMRUT 2.0, extending until 2027-28, aims to achieve 100% sewerage/septage management coverage in all statutory towns and 100% water supply coverage in 500 AMRUT cities, relying solely on public expenditure for funding.
2.  The mission emphasizes a circular economy approach to water management, requiring Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to submit City Water Balance Plans (CWBPs) and City Water Action Plans (CWAPs) through an online portal.  At least 10% of total funding must be allocated to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in all cities.
3.  AMRUT 2.0 incorporates a robust capacity-building program for all stakeholders, including women SHGs involved in water quality testing and infrastructure operations.  The mission uses a centralized Management Information System (MIS) platform for monitoring and evaluation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AMRUT 2.0's tenure is until 2025-26, not 2027-28.  The 100% coverage targets are accurate, but the funding mechanism is not solely public expenditure; it includes outcome-based funding and PPPs.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The circular economy approach and the submission of CWBPs and CWAPs through an online portal are accurate. The 10% PPP funding mandate, however, applies only to million-plus cities, not all cities.

Statement 3 is correct. The capacity-building program and the involvement of women SHGs are accurate. The use of a centralized MIS platform for monitoring is also correct.

Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are the most accurate, making (c) the correct option.  Statement 1 contains several inaccuracies regarding the tenure and funding of the AMRUT 2.0 mission.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMFBY, a demand-driven scheme, offers voluntary crop insurance coverage to all farmers, including sharecroppers and tenant farmers, covering only kharif crops like cereals, millets, and pulses.  The premium is a fixed percentage of the sum assured.
2.  The scheme uses weather parameters as a proxy for crop yield in compensating for losses, excluding losses due to preventable risks and war.  Beneficiary identification mandates Aadhaar.
3.  DigiClaim, a digitized claim settlement module, processes claims through the National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) and disburses payments through the Public Finance Management System (PFMS).  Farmers have direct access to the DigiClaim module for tracking their claim status.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMFBY is demand-driven and voluntary, it covers both kharif and rabi crops, including oilseeds, not just cereals, millets and pulses. The premium is not a fixed percentage; it's the lower of a percentage of the sum assured or the Actuarial Premium Rate (APR).

Statement 2 is correct. The use of weather parameters as a proxy for crop yield, exclusion of preventable risks and war, and the Aadhaar mandate are all accurate aspects of the PMFBY.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Farmers do *not* have direct access to the DigiClaim module; only government functionaries do.  The statement correctly describes the use of NCIP and PFMS for processing and disbursing payments, but misrepresents the level of farmer access to claim status tracking.

Therefore, only Statement 2 is entirely correct, making (a) the correct answer.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies regarding crop coverage, premium calculation, and farmer access to the DigiClaim module.


**4. With reference to the District Mineral Foundation (DMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DMF utilizes funds collected as a percentage of royalty on the production of minor minerals to undertake development works in mining-affected areas, prioritizing high priority sectors like drinking water supply and environment preservation, with at least 70% of funds allocated to directly affected areas.  Funds are disbursed through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) only.
2.  The DMF prepares a five-year perspective plan, incorporating baseline survey findings and converging with ongoing central and state schemes.  The DMF funds must adhere to the 'polluter pays principle'.
3.  Transparency and accountability mechanisms include voluntary disclosures under the RTI Act, online portals for project approval and fund monitoring, and audits by the CAG and a chartered accountant appointed by the DMF.  Grievances must be redressed within 30 days.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. DMF funds are collected from royalty on *major* minerals, not minor minerals. While the prioritization of drinking water and environmental preservation is correct, the 70% allocation to directly affected areas is also incorrect; it's a minimum of 70%. DBT is used but the statement says 'only' which is incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The five-year perspective plan based on baseline surveys is accurate, but the requirement of adhering to the 'polluter pays principle' is incorrect; this principle is explicitly *not* to be followed under PMKKKY.

Statement 3 is correct. The description of transparency and accountability measures, including RTI disclosures, online portals, CAG and chartered accountant audits, and grievance redressal timelines, accurately reflects the DMF's operational framework.

Thus, only statement 3 is entirely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  Statements 1 and 2 contain significant inaccuracies about the source of funds and the application of the 'polluter pays principle'.


**5. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK), consider the following statements:**

1. PMJVK, a centrally sponsored scheme, aims to reduce developmental deficits in minority concentration areas (where the minority population exceeds 15% within a 15 km radius) by providing financial assistance for community asset creation, excluding infrastructure projects.
2.  The scheme, formerly known as the Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP), targets all districts, including aspirational districts, and benefits all minority communities notified under the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992.  NITI Aayog designates it as a Core of the Core Scheme.
3.  PMJVK provides demand-driven financial assistance for infrastructure development focusing on community assets; these assets are exclusively for the use of minority communities within the catchment areas.  The scheme's monitoring involves National, State, and District level Monitoring Committees.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the scheme does aim to reduce developmental deficits in minority concentration areas and provides financial assistance for community asset creation, the minority population threshold is 25%, not 15%, within a 15 km radius. The statement also incorrectly excludes infrastructure projects; infrastructure is a key component.

Statement 2 is correct. The historical context (MsDP restructuring), the target coverage (all districts, including aspirational ones), beneficiary groups (all notified minority communities), and NITI Aayog's designation are all accurately described.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The assets created under PMJVK are for the use of *all* communities in the catchment area, not exclusively minority communities. The monitoring mechanism by the committees is accurately described.

Therefore, only Statement 2 is completely correct, making (a) the correct answer. Statements 1 and 3 misrepresent key aspects of the scheme's target beneficiaries and asset usage.


**6. With reference to the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), consider the following statements:**

1. JJM, a centrally sponsored scheme, aims to provide Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTCs) to every rural household by 2024, prioritizing districts affected by Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES).  Funding is contingent upon state contribution and utilization of central funds.
2.  The scheme promotes decentralized planning through Village Action Plans (VAPs) focusing on water sources, greywater reuse, and system operation & maintenance.  Paani Samitis, with at least 50% women members, are responsible for system operation and maintenance.
3.  JJM uses the JJM-WQMIS for real-time monitoring, mandates Aadhaar linkage for tap connections, and conducts mandatory Third Party Inspection (TPI) to ensure quality.  The scheme's success is measured by 'Har Ghar Jal' certification.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, although the 2024 deadline is a target and may not be fully achieved.  Prioritization of JE/AES affected districts is accurate, as is the funding mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct. The decentralized approach with VAPs, the role of Paani Samitis with women representation, and their operational responsibilities are accurately depicted.

Statement 3 is correct. The monitoring through JJM-WQMIS, Aadhaar linkage, mandatory TPI, and the use of 'Har Ghar Jal' certification for measuring success are all accurate features of JJM implementation.

Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are completely accurate, making (b) the correct option. While statement 1 is largely correct, the phrasing about the 2024 deadline makes it less precise than the other two.


**7. With reference to the Namami Gange Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Namami Gange, a centrally sponsored scheme, aims to achieve continuous and unpolluted flow (“Aviral Dhara” and “Nirmal Dhara”) in the Ganga River by 2026, focusing solely on river surface cleaning and industrial effluent monitoring.  Funding is entirely from the central budget.
2.  The scheme adopts a river basin approach, emphasizing eight key pillars including sewerage treatment, afforestation, and public awareness.  The World Bank provides funding through a loan approved for a period of 5 years.
3.  The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, acts as the implementing agency.  The scheme includes operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for 15 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the scheme aims for Aviral and Nirmal Dhara, it's not limited to surface cleaning and industrial effluent monitoring; it encompasses a much broader range of activities. The funding also includes a World Bank loan.

Statement 2 is correct. The river basin approach, the eight key pillars (including those mentioned), and the World Bank loan are accurately described.

Statement 3 is correct. The NMCG's role as implementing agency, registration under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and the inclusion of 15-year O&M costs are all accurate.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  Statement 1 significantly underrepresents the scope and funding mechanisms of the Namami Gange Yojana.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring precise recall of details and the ability to discern subtle inaccuracies within plausible distractors.  They assess factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills, aligning with the demands of the UPSC exam.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to Oman, consider the following statements:**

1.  Oman shares a maritime border with Iran and a land border with Yemen.
2.  The demographic dividend is a significant challenge for Oman's economic development.
3.  Oman's economy heavily relies on limestone exports, surpassing oil revenue.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Oman does indeed share a maritime border with Iran and a land border with Yemen.  These are well-established geographical facts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Oman, like many countries, faces challenges related to its demographics, the statement misrepresents the demographic dividend as a *challenge*.  The demographic dividend refers to the potential economic growth that can occur when a large portion of the population is of working age.  Oman's relatively young population presents an *opportunity* for a demographic dividend, not a challenge.  Challenges might include creating enough jobs for this growing workforce or providing adequate education and training.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Oman does export limestone, it is inaccurate to state that limestone exports surpass oil revenue.  Oman's economy remains significantly reliant on oil and gas revenues, although it is diversifying its economy.  Limestone is a relatively minor export compared to the nation's hydrocarbon sector.


**2. With reference to Nigeria, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nigeria's population surpasses that of Egypt, making it the most populous nation in Africa.
2.  Cocoa is Nigeria's primary agricultural export, contributing significantly more to its GDP than oil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nigeria has a very large population, it is not the most populous in Africa.  That distinction belongs to either Egypt or Nigeria depending on the source and year.  The statement incorrectly claims a clear superiority in population size.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Oil remains Nigeria's most significant export and contributor to its GDP.  While cocoa is an important agricultural product, it does not outweigh oil's economic impact. The statement exaggerates cocoa's economic significance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Nile River is the longest river in Africa. The Niger River is indeed a major river in West Africa but is shorter than the Nile.


**3. With reference to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  CPEC primarily connects Pakistan's Karachi port to China's Gwadar port.

3.  CPEC's route traverses through the disputed Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPEC connects China's Xinjiang region to Pakistan's Gwadar Port, not Karachi. Karachi is another significant port in Pakistan, but it is not the primary focus of the CPEC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CPEC is a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013.  The CPEC was launched in 2015, after the BRI.  It is not a pilot project in the sense of being chronologically prior to the BRI's conception.

Statement 3 is correct. The CPEC route does indeed pass through the disputed Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, a point of contention with India and other countries.


**4. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), consider the following statements:**

1.  Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines are founding members of ASEAN.

3.  Hawking radiation's existence has been directly observed and experimentally verified, confirming its theoretical predictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Hawking radiation does involve particles escaping the black hole's event horizon, the exact composition is still a subject of ongoing research and theoretical debate.  It's theorized to consist of pairs of particles and antiparticles created near the event horizon, with one escaping and the other falling into the black hole. Photons and neutrinos are among the particles expected, but not exclusively.

Statement 2 is correct. Stephen Hawking proposed the theory of Hawking radiation in 1974, revolutionizing our understanding of black holes. His work suggested that black holes are not perfectly black but emit a faint thermal radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation, although extremely weak, gradually causes black holes to lose mass and eventually evaporate.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Despite decades of research, direct observational evidence of Hawking radiation remains elusive. The radiation is incredibly faint and difficult to detect against the background radiation of the universe.  Current technology is not advanced enough to provide definitive experimental confirmation.  The detection would require extremely sensitive instruments capable of distinguishing the extremely low-energy radiation predicted by the theory from other sources of background noise.  Future advancements in technology might allow for such detection.  Therefore, the statement is currently false.

3.  Spacecraft positioned at the L1 Lagrange point experience minimal gravitational influence from both the Sun and Earth, requiring negligible fuel for station-keeping.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The SOHO satellite is indeed located at the L1 Lagrange point. This location provides an uninterrupted view of the Sun, crucial for its mission of studying the Sun's atmosphere and solar wind. The L1 point's location minimizes the obstructions caused by Earth.

Statement 2 is correct. The L1 Lagrange point is a point of gravitational equilibrium between the Sun and Earth.  The combined gravitational pull of these two celestial bodies balances the centrifugal force experienced by an object at that point, allowing a spacecraft to remain relatively stable without requiring continuous orbital adjustments. This stability significantly reduces fuel consumption for maintaining position.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the gravitational forces are balanced at L1, they are not negligible.  Spacecraft still experience some gravitational influence from the Sun and Earth, and other gravitational perturbations from planets, requiring occasional course corrections and fuel expenditure for maintaining a stable halo orbit around the L1 point.  The fuel requirements are significantly less than at other orbital locations, but not entirely eliminated.


**3. With reference to Alzheimer's disease, consider the following statements:**

2.  Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized solely by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques in the brain.
3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary diagnostic tool definitively confirming the presence and severity of Alzheimer's disease.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Donanemab is indeed an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody designed to target amyloid beta plaques, a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease.  However, it's important to note that while targeting amyloid plaques is a promising therapeutic strategy, its effectiveness is not universally guaranteed, and it's not a cure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While amyloid beta plaque accumulation is a significant characteristic of Alzheimer's, it's not the sole defining factor. The disease's complexity involves multiple pathological processes, including neurofibrillary tangles (made of tau protein), neuronal loss, and inflammation.  Oversimplifying the disease's etiology to just amyloid plaques is a misleading simplification.

Statement 3 is incorrect. MRI scans are valuable tools in assessing brain structure and detecting potential signs of Alzheimer's such as atrophy, but they do not definitively diagnose the disease.  A definitive diagnosis often requires a combination of clinical evaluation, cognitive testing, and sometimes even cerebrospinal fluid analysis to identify specific biomarkers.  MRI can help rule out other conditions mimicking Alzheimer's, but it's not a sole diagnostic method.

1.  The BCG vaccine offers complete protection against all forms of TB, including drug-resistant strains.
2.  Rifampicin and isoniazid are among the common drugs used to treat TB, but their effectiveness can be compromised by the emergence of drug-resistant strains.
3.  The National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) solely focuses on direct treatment of individuals diagnosed with TB, neglecting preventive measures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BCG vaccine is effective in preventing pulmonary TB in children, but its efficacy varies and it doesn't offer complete protection against all forms of TB, especially drug-resistant strains.  The vaccine primarily prevents severe forms of the disease, particularly in children.  Drug-resistant TB strains are a significant challenge to global TB control efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but ultimately incorrect due to a misleading detail.  The 2024 rules do indeed replace the 1983 rules and introduce stricter conditions for licensing Schedule I animals.  However, the statement incorrectly states that licensing is permitted with prior consultation of the *State* Government.  It requires consultation with the *Central* Government.  This subtle change makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  The rules mandate electronic registration for specified animals, along with timeframes for reporting births and transfers. This tests factual recall of the specific timelines mentioned in the rules.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The application for transferring captive elephants is to be made to the Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), not the Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW).  The CWW is involved in the approval process, but the initial application is made to the DCF.  This detail is crucial and serves as a strong distractor.


**5. With reference to the Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric, consider the following statements:**

1. The STAR metric, launched in 2021 for terrestrial areas and later expanded to marine areas, utilizes data from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to assess extinction risks and species threats, estimating the contribution of threat abatement and habitat restoration.
2.  The STAR metric primarily focuses on quantifying the potential of specific actions at specific locations to contribute to national conservation targets set by individual countries, utilizing AI-based software for efficient data analysis.
3.  The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in partnership with other organizations, developed the STAR metric to assess biodiversity loss, and its application has been recognized by the United Nations for its innovative approach to conservation planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description accurately reflects the STAR metric's purpose, data source (IUCN Red List), and assessment focus (extinction risk, threat abatement, habitat restoration). The timeline (2021 launch and expansion to marine areas) adds a layer of factual detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The STAR metric contributes to *international* conservation targets, not national ones.  The statement also falsely claims that AI-based software is used for analysis; the source material makes no such claim.

Statement 3 is correct. The IUCN's role in developing the metric and the UN's recognition of the initiative are accurately stated. This demonstrates understanding of the collaboration and the wider significance of the metric.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test various cognitive skills, primarily factual recall with misleading information incorporated into the distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Kaziranga National Park:**

1.  Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located in the Golaghat and Nagaon districts of Assam, bordering the Brahmaputra River and the Karbi Anglong hills.
2.  The park's unique geographical location within the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot contributes to its high density of Indian rhinoceros, tigers, and elephants, along with a significant population of the endangered Western Hoolock Gibbon. 
3.  National Highway 37 (NH 37) bisects the park, creating a significant barrier to animal movement and impacting the park's overall ecological integrity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kaziranga National Park is indeed located in the Golaghat and Nagaon districts of Assam, and its boundaries include the Brahmaputra River and the Karbi Anglong hills.  It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Statement 2 is largely correct. While the Western Hoolock Gibbon is found in Northeast India, it's not specifically a dominant species in Kaziranga.  The park's location within the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot and its unique ecosystem do support high densities of the Indian rhinoceros, tigers, and elephants.  The statement is not entirely precise in its description of the Gibbon's presence, but the overall description of the park's biodiversity is factually accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While NH 37 does pass through Kaziranga National Park,  it does not bisect the park creating an insurmountable barrier. The impact of the highway on animal movement is a concern, but the statement's phrasing is an overstatement of the situation.  The impact is significant but not to the extent described.


**2. With reference to Kaziranga National Park, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Manas River forms a significant part of Kaziranga's western boundary, contributing to the park's diverse aquatic ecosystem.
2.  The park's flora includes predominantly Himalayan moist temperate forests, characterized by species like Kashmir elm, white willow, and Himalayan poplar.
3.  Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, known for its high density of one-horned rhinoceros, is located within the geographical boundaries of Kaziranga National Park.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

Statement 2 is correct. The IFWCS aims to provide market-based incentives for sustainable forest management and agroforestry, encouraging participation and fostering responsible practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NWPC 2023, including the IFMS, is directly relevant to the IFWCS. The IFMS forms the basis for forest management certification under the IFWCS.  Therefore, the NWPC 2023 is integral to the IFWCS certification process.


These five MCQs demonstrate the style and difficulty level required, focusing on detailed factual recall and incorporating plausible distractors to challenge the examinee's understanding.  Further questions can be generated following this pattern, covering the remaining information in the target content.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on biofuels,  the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972,  IUCN, and related environmental topics.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding biofuels:**

1.  Rapeseed oil is a primary feedstock for first-generation biodiesel production, utilizing established technologies.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana primarily focuses on promoting the use of biodiesel derived from used cooking oil.
3.  Genetically modified algae are currently the most efficient source for large-scale ethanol production for the transport sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rapeseed oil is indeed a common feedstock for first-generation biodiesel production, a well-established technology.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana does aim to promote biofuels, its primary focus is on the use of ethanol blended with petrol, not necessarily biodiesel from used cooking oil. The RUCO (Repurpose Used Cooking Oil) scheme is a separate initiative targeting biodiesel production from used cooking oil.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While genetically modified organisms hold promise for biofuel production,  currently algae-based ethanol production is not at a large scale, and other feedstocks like sugarcane and corn are more prevalent for ethanol production for the transport sector.  The efficiency of different biofuel sources is also an area of ongoing research and development.


**2. With reference to the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, consider the following statements:**

1.  Schedule I of the Act lists species with the highest degree of protection, prohibiting all forms of trade and hunting except under exceptional circumstances.
2.  The Act mandates the creation of Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs) within a 10 km radius of all protected areas.
3.  The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau's primary function is enforcing the provisions of the CITES treaty within India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, indeed provides the highest level of protection to listed species, severely restricting trade and hunting. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the National Wildlife Action Plan (2002-2016) recommended ESZs within 10 km of protected areas,  the Act itself doesn't mandate a specific radius. The creation and extent of ESZs are determined by other regulations and guidelines. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau enforces the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972,  within India.  CITES is an international treaty, and while the Act incorporates species listed in CITES, the Bureau's primary focus is on domestic law enforcement.


**3. Consider the following statements about the IUCN:**

1.  The IUCN Red List categorizes species based solely on population size, with critically endangered species having fewer than 50 mature individuals.
2.  The IUCN publishes the Red Data Book, a comprehensive document detailing the conservation status of all known plant and animal species.
3. The IUCN's headquarters is located in Gland, Switzerland.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While population size is a crucial factor, the IUCN Red List uses a more complex assessment considering various threats, geographic range, population decline rate, and other factors to categorize species. A population size of under 50 mature individuals is one indicator that might lead to a critically endangered status, but it's not the sole criterion. Statement 2 is incorrect. The IUCN publishes the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, not the Red Data Book. The Red Data Book is a similar but separate initiative. Statement 3 is correct. The IUCN's headquarters are indeed located in Gland, Switzerland.


**4. With reference to the conservation status of species, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.
2.  The Estuarine Crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is categorized as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, indicating a stable population.
3.  The Mugger Crocodile (Crocodylus palustris) has a conservation status of Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Gharial is listed as Critically Endangered. Statement 2 is correct; the Estuarine Crocodile is indeed listed as Least Concern. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Mugger Crocodile is listed as Vulnerable, not Critically Endangered.  The IUCN Red List categorizations reflect the complexities of species' conservation status, influenced by factors like habitat loss, poaching, and climate change.


**5. With reference to the Miyawaki method of afforestation, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Miyawaki method was developed in the 1970s by a Japanese botanist named Akira Miyawaki and prioritizes the use of fast-growing exotic species to achieve rapid forest growth.

These questions demonstrate the creation of difficult UPSC-style MCQs by employing various techniques to mislead the examinee while maintaining factual accuracy within the context of the provided text.  Remember that the difficulty level is subjective.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to Malaria, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) explicitly included the eradication of Malaria as a primary target.
2.  The RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) malaria vaccine is currently listed on the WHO's essential medicines list.
3.  *Anopheles stephensi* is the primary vector responsible for the transmission of all forms of Malaria globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. Let's analyze each:

1. **Incorrect:** While the MDGs aimed to reduce the global burden of malaria significantly, they did not set a goal for complete eradication.  The target was to reduce malaria incidence and mortality rates by a certain percentage. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the successor to the MDGs, also maintain a similar focus on reduction rather than eradication.

2. **Incorrect:** The RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) malaria vaccine is a significant development, but it's not on the WHO's essential medicines list in the same way that other widely used and readily available drugs are.  Its inclusion in WHO recommendations is more nuanced,  considering its limited efficacy and targeted use in specific high-risk populations. The WHO's essential medicines list prioritizes cost-effectiveness and broad applicability.

3. **Incorrect:**  *Anopheles stephensi* is a significant malaria vector, especially in urban areas, but it is not the primary vector globally.  Many different *Anopheles* species transmit malaria, with their prevalence varying significantly depending on geographical location and environmental conditions.  The statement oversimplifies the complex epidemiology of malaria transmission.


**2. With reference to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The development of 'superbugs' is primarily attributed to the overuse of antibiotics in livestock farming, causing minimal impact on human health.
2.  AMR is primarily a concern for high-income countries with advanced healthcare systems, leaving low-income nations relatively unaffected.
3.  The Longitude Prize, focusing on AMR solutions, has been awarded to a project aimed at improving rapid diagnostic testing for urinary tract infections.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Let's examine the others:

1. **Incorrect:** The development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a multifaceted problem stemming from the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in various sectors, including human medicine, livestock, and agriculture.  While antibiotic use in livestock contributes significantly to AMR,  its impact on human health is substantial due to the transfer of resistant bacteria through the food chain and the environment. The statement minimizes this crucial link.

2. **Incorrect:** AMR is a global health crisis affecting both high-income and low-income countries. While high-income countries might have better surveillance and treatment options, low-income nations often face a heavier burden due to limited access to healthcare, sanitation, and effective antibiotics.  The statement presents a misleadingly simplistic view of the global distribution of AMR.

3. **Correct:** The Longitude Prize awarded to the PA-100 AST System directly addresses the challenge of AMR by improving rapid diagnostic testing, which is crucial for effective antibiotic stewardship and reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics.  This contributes to slowing down the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.


**3. With reference to Tuberculosis (TB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) in India is solely focused on treating active TB cases, neglecting preventive measures.
2.  TB is classified as a type of infectious disease under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), but it is not considered a public health emergency.
3.  Malaria and TB share similar transmission mechanisms, both being primarily spread through airborne droplets.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate.

1. **Incorrect:** The NTEP in India employs a comprehensive strategy that includes both treatment of active TB cases and preventive measures such as screening, latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment, and vaccination (BCG). The statement incorrectly portrays the program as solely treatment-focused.

2. **Incorrect:** TB is classified under ICD-11 and is considered a global public health emergency by the WHO due to its high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in low- and middle-income countries.  The statement incorrectly states that it is *not* a public health emergency.

3. **Incorrect:** While both malaria and TB are infectious diseases, their transmission mechanisms differ significantly. Malaria is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes (a vector-borne disease), while TB is primarily spread through airborne droplets produced by individuals with active TB (an airborne disease). The statement confuses the transmission routes.


**4. With reference to the Kafala system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kafala system is primarily used in South Asian countries to regulate the employment of domestic workers and ensures their rights.
2.  Under the Kafala system, foreign workers can freely change employers without their sponsor's consent and can easily leave the host country.
3.  The Kafala system establishes a relationship between a foreign worker and their local sponsor (usually their employer), often leading to exploitation and human rights abuses.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

Furthermore, it's widely criticized for its failure to adequately protect the rights of migrant workers.  The statement misrepresents the geographical location and the protective aspects of the system.

2. **Incorrect:**  A key characteristic of the Kafala system is that foreign workers require their sponsor's (typically their employer's) permission to change jobs or leave the country. This often leads to exploitation and restricts the workers' freedom of movement and employment. The statement contradicts this fundamental aspect.

3. **Correct:** The Kafala system creates a dependency relationship where the sponsor holds significant control over the worker's legal status and employment. This power imbalance frequently leads to exploitation, including wage theft, forced labour, and restricted movement. The statement accurately describes the core issue of the Kafala system.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Kakori Train Robbery was indeed undertaken by the HRA to secure funds for procuring weapons and furthering their revolutionary activities. While the immediate goal was financial, the underlying objective was to bolster their capacity for armed resistance against British rule. The scale of the rebellion they envisioned might have been more ambitious than a mere "full-scale" revolt, but the statement does convey the core purpose of the action.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Do or Die" call was indeed given by Mahatma Gandhi, but it wasn't during the Dandi March.  The Dandi March was a significant event in the Civil Disobedience Movement, but the "Do or Die" call was delivered later, during the Quit India Movement.  The call symbolized a heightened level of commitment and sacrifice, urging Indians to participate actively in the struggle for independence.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Pingali Venkayya is credited with designing the Indian National Flag, the process involved consultations and interactions with various individuals, including Mahatma Gandhi.  The flag's final adoption was a collaborative effort, and it wasn't presented solely to the Constituent Assembly, but to Gandhi who then presented it to the Congress.


**3. With reference to the concept of Swaraj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Swaraj, as envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi, was solely focused on political independence, rejecting the need for social and economic reforms.
2.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak's interpretation of Swaraj prioritized self-governance at the local level, advocating for decentralization of power.
3.  The Home Rule Movement, spearheaded by Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, directly sought to establish complete independence from British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Gandhi's concept of Swaraj was holistic, encompassing political, social, and economic freedom.  He believed that true self-rule required a transformation of individual and societal consciousness, extending beyond mere political independence to include social justice and economic equality.  His emphasis on self-sufficiency (through Khadi) and social reform (through eradication of untouchability) clearly demonstrates this.

Statement 2 is partially correct but oversimplified. While Tilak did emphasize self-reliance and local initiatives (through festivals), his vision of Swaraj wasn't exclusively focused on local self-governance. He also advocated for broader political autonomy at the national level, albeit through different means than Gandhi.  Describing his vision as *prioritizing* local self-governance is misleading.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Home Rule Movement, while advocating for greater self-governance,  did not explicitly aim for complete independence. The movement's demands were more focused on achieving dominion status, a step towards greater autonomy within the British Empire rather than immediate full independence.  The movement served as a significant step towards complete independence, but it did not directly seek it.


**4. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded posthumously only to individuals who made significant contributions in the field of science and technology.
2.  The award is conferred by the Prime Minister of India, based on recommendations from a nominated committee.
3.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna are permitted to use the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their name.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many Bharat Ratna recipients have been scientists and technologists, the award isn't restricted to this field.  It recognizes exceptional contributions across various domains, including arts, literature, sports, and public service. The posthumous awarding of the Bharat Ratna is allowed but not limited to science and technology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna is conferred by the President of India, based on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.  There isn't a formally constituted committee for the specific purpose of selecting Bharat Ratna recipients; the Prime Minister's recommendation is usually the basis of the President's decision.

Statement 3 is incorrect. According to Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution, recipients are explicitly prohibited from using the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their names.  They can mention their receipt of the award in their biographical information, but not as a formal title.


**5. With reference to the Gallantry Awards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ashoka Chakra is awarded for acts of exceptional courage and bravery displayed only during wartime operations.
2.  The Kirti Chakra is awarded for exceptional bravery or gallantry displayed in peacetime, while the Shaurya Chakra is for wartime bravery.
3.  The announcement of Gallantry Awards is exclusively made on Republic Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ashoka Chakra can be awarded for acts of exceptional bravery in both wartime and peacetime. The criteria are based on the level of courage and self-sacrifice demonstrated, not solely the context of the situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Both the Kirti Chakra and the Shaurya Chakra are awarded for gallantry, but the Kirti Chakra is a higher award. The Kirti Chakra is for exceptional bravery or gallantry displayed in peacetime, while the Shaurya Chakra is for bravery or gallantry displayed in peacetime or wartime.  The distinction isn't strictly limited to peacetime versus wartime.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While many gallantry awards are announced on Republic Day, they can also be announced at other times throughout the year, as deemed appropriate by the government.  The Republic Day announcement is a significant one, but not the exclusive time for such announcements.


**6. With reference to the Classical Languages of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All classical languages of India are included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India.
2.  Odia is one of the classical languages of India, declared so in 2014.
3.  The declaration of a language as a classical language is based solely on its antiquity and the richness of its ancient literature.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many classical languages are listed in the Eighth Schedule, not all classical languages are included. The Eighth Schedule lists languages recognized for official use, whereas the classical language status is a separate recognition based on different criteria.

Statement 2 is correct. Odia was declared a classical language of India in 2014,  acknowledging its rich literary heritage and antiquity.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  Antiquity and richness of ancient literature are significant factors in the declaration of a classical language, but they are not the sole criteria.  Other factors, such as its influence on other languages and its contribution to Indian culture, are also considered.  The process involves a complex evaluation of various aspects of the language's historical and cultural significance.


**7. With reference to the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 92nd Amendment Act of 2003 added Konkani, Manipuri, and Nepali to the Eighth Schedule.
2.  The Eighth Schedule currently recognizes 22 languages, including Urdu and Nepali.
3.  The inclusion of a language in the Eighth Schedule guarantees its use in all official communications throughout the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 71st Amendment Act of 1992 added Konkani, Manipuri, and Nepali. The 92nd Amendment Act of 2003 added Bodo, Dogri, Maithili, and Santhali.

Statement 2 is correct. The Eighth Schedule currently recognizes 22 languages, including Urdu and Nepali.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Inclusion in the Eighth Schedule gives recognition and facilitates the use of the language in official capacities, but doesn't guarantee its use in *all* official communications everywhere in the country.  The actual use of these languages varies depending on regional and administrative contexts.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Pingali Venkayya's initial design for the Indian National Flag featured red and green bands, symbolizing the Hindu and Muslim communities, respectively.  A spinning wheel was added later.
2.  Pingali Venkayya's acquaintance with Mahatma Gandhi predates his participation in the Boer War.
3.  Pingali Venkayya's book, "Bharatha Deshaniki Oka Jatiya Patakam," proposing various flag designs, was published in 1917.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The initial design of the Swaraj flag by Pingali Venkayya indeed included red and green bands representing the two major communities of the time. The white strip and the charkha were added later on Mahatma Gandhi's suggestion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Pingali Venkayya did meet Mahatma Gandhi, the evidence suggests that their first meeting occurred *after* his participation in the Boer War. The provided text supports this chronology.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Venkayya's book, presenting 24 flag designs, was published in 1916, not 1917.  Minor discrepancies in dates often appear in historical accounts, but the provided text itself gives a definitive date.  Therefore, even a slight variation should be treated as incorrect in this context.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Flag and its designer, consider the following statements:**

1.  The final design of the Indian National Flag, as adopted, incorporated elements suggested by Mahatma Gandhi, including a white band symbolizing peace.
2.  Pingali Venkayya’s military service in the British Indian Army significantly influenced his design of the Indian National Flag.
3.  The publication of Pingali Venkayya's booklet on flag designs coincided with the peak of the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Mahatma Gandhi's contribution to the final design of the Indian National Flag is well-documented, including the addition of the white band and the charkha (spinning wheel).

Statement 2 is misleading. While Pingali Venkayya's military experience is mentioned, there's no direct evidence linking this experience as a *significant influence* on the flag's design. The text doesn't establish a causal link between his military service and the design elements.  The question plays on the possibility that some examinees might assume a military background would inherently influence a national symbol.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text indicates that Venkayya's booklet was published in 1916, while the Non-Cooperation Movement reached its peak later. The question utilizes the temporal proximity of these events to create a distractor.  The examinee needs precise knowledge of the publication date to identify this inaccuracy.


**3. With reference to Rabindranath Tagore's life and work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tagore's active participation in the Indian nationalist movement involved leading large-scale protests against British rule.
2.  Visva-Bharati University, founded by Tagore, primarily focused on promoting traditional Indian art forms, neglecting modern disciplines.
3.  Tagore's "Gitanjali," awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, was originally composed in English.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Tagore's involvement in the nationalist movement was primarily intellectual and cultural, not through direct, large-scale protest. He used his writings and influence to oppose colonialism but did not lead mass protests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Visva-Bharati University, while rooted in Indian culture, had a broader vision encompassing intercultural understanding and modern education.  The statement presents a limited and inaccurate view of the university's scope.

Statement 3 is incorrect. "Gitanjali" was originally written in Bengali, not English. The Nobel Prize was awarded for its English translation. The question uses the fact of the English translation to mislead examinees into selecting the wrong answer.


**4. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The August Offer, preceding the Quit India Movement, was readily accepted by the Indian National Congress.
2. Mahatma Gandhi's famous "Do or Die" call was issued in Mumbai on August 8, 1942.
3. The Quit India Movement's primary objective was the immediate establishment of a fully independent Indian government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The August Offer was rejected by both the Congress and the Muslim League, fueling dissatisfaction and leading to the Quit India Movement. The statement contradicts a key historical fact, acting as a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Gandhi's "Do or Die" speech in Mumbai on August 8, 1942.

Statement 3 is partially correct in its intent but factually imprecise. While complete independence was the ultimate goal, the immediate objective was a more nuanced demand for an "orderly British withdrawal." The question uses the nuanced phrasing of the actual demand to create a difficult choice for the examinee.  The examinee must distinguish between the ultimate goal and the immediate call to action.


**5. With reference to the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action, led by Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan, resulted in the looting of approximately ₹10,000.
2.  The Hindustan Republican Association's (HRA) primary objective was to overthrow the British government through non-violent means.
3. Rajendra Lahiri's role in the Kakori Train Action involved pulling the emergency chain, bringing the train to a halt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The amount looted was approximately ₹8000, not ₹10,000.  The question uses a close but incorrect figure to test the examinee's precise recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The HRA aimed to overthrow the British government through armed revolution, not non-violent means. This statement is a crucial distractor, playing on the contrast between revolutionary and non-violent approaches to independence.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Rajendra Lahiri's role in halting the train.


**6. With reference to Vikram Sarabhai's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Vikram Sarabhai initiated the Indian Space Programme in 1962.
2. The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in Thiruvananthapuram was established in his memory after his death.
3. Sarabhai received the Padma Vibhushan award posthumously in 1971.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Space Programme was initiated in 1960, not 1962.  The question uses an incorrect date to test the examinee's precise memory.

Statement 2 is correct. The VSSC was indeed named in his honor after his death.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Sarabhai received the Padma Vibhushan posthumously in 1972, not 1971.  The question uses a slightly incorrect year to further increase the difficulty.


**7. Consider the following statements about Gotipua dance:**

1. Gotipua dance is a traditional dance form from the state of West Bengal, which is a precursor to Odissi.
2.  Gotipua dancers, traditionally young boys, dress as women to perform acrobatic figures inspired by the life of Radha and Krishna.
3. The future of Gotipua child artistes is secure, as the tradition continues to thrive without any challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gotipua is from Odisha, not West Bengal.  The question uses a geographically close but incorrect state to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of Gotipua dancers accurately reflects the tradition.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the uncertain future of Gotipua artistes after puberty. The question uses the opposite of the actual situation to test the examinee's understanding of the challenges faced by this art form.


**8. With reference to V.V. Giri, consider the following statements:**

1. V.V. Giri served as the fifth President of India.
2. He was the first President of India to be elected as an independent candidate.
3. He received the Bharat Ratna award in 1976.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. He was indeed the first president elected as an independent candidate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. He received the Bharat Ratna in 1975, not 1976. The question again utilizes a slightly incorrect year to increase the challenge.


**9. Consider the following statements about Kolattam dance:**

1. Kolattam is predominantly a dance performed by men in South India.
2.  Seethakali, a Dravidian dance form, is believed to have originated in the Kollam district of Kerala.
3. Gotipua dance, performed by boys dressed as women, is a traditional dance form of Andhra Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kolattam is predominantly performed by women, not men. The question plays on gender roles in traditional dance forms.

Statement 2 is correct. The origin of Seethakali is accurately described.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gotipua is from Odisha, not Andhra Pradesh.  The question uses a geographically close, but incorrect state, creating a distractor.


**10. With reference to Khudiram Bose, consider the following statements:**

1. Khudiram Bose was arrested for participating in the Swadeshi Andolan.
2.  Khudiram Bose's assassination attempt targeted a British judge, Magistrate Douglas Kingsford.
3.  Khudiram Bose was executed at the age of 19.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bose participated in protests against the British, the text doesn't specify his arrest was directly related to the Swadeshi Andolan. The text mentions his participation in protests against the Partition of Bengal, which occurred after the Swadeshi Movement.


Statement 2 is correct. This is a key event in Bose's life.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  He was executed at age 18. The question uses an incorrect age to test the examinee's accuracy.



**11.  With reference to Madame Bhikaji Cama, consider the following statements:**

1.  Madame Bhikaji Cama hoisted a version of the Indian flag in London in 1907.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The flag was hoisted in Stuttgart, Germany, not London.  The question uses a key location detail to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Paris Indian Society was co-founded in 1905, not 1906. A slightly incorrect year is used as a distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. She launched the Paris edition, not the London edition. The question uses a key location detail to create a distractor.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring precise recall of facts and careful analysis to avoid plausible distractors.  They aim to replicate the difficulty level and style found in the UPSC Civil Services Examination.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's architectural style, characterized by intricate carvings and towering gopurams, is predominantly found in Hampi, but also influenced temple architecture in other parts of South India.
2.  The Tungabhadra River played a crucial role in the irrigation systems of the Vijayanagara Empire, supporting its agricultural economy and the growth of its capital, Hampi.
3. The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi, a significant religious site, was primarily constructed during the early years of the Vijayanagara Empire, before the reign of Krishnadevaraya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Vijayanagara architectural style, known for its grandeur and intricate detail, is heavily represented in Hampi.  While Hampi is the prime example, the influence of this style extended to other regions of South India, albeit with regional variations. The statement accurately captures the core architectural characteristics and the broader influence.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Tungabhadra River was vital to the Vijayanagara Empire's agricultural prosperity and the functioning of its capital, Hampi.  The empire developed sophisticated irrigation systems leveraging the river's resources, supporting a substantial population and contributing significantly to its economic strength.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Virupaksha Temple's origins predate Krishnadevaraya, it underwent significant expansion and embellishment during his reign and later periods.  Attributing its primary construction solely to the empire's early years is an oversimplification of its complex history.  The temple's development spanned centuries, reflecting the evolving power and religious devotion of successive rulers.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The empire's political structure relied heavily on the decentralized power of Amara Nayakas, who were appointed as governors of various provinces, leading to both stability and occasional fragmentation.
2. The Battle of Talikota in 1565 marked the definitive end of the Vijayanagara Empire, leading to its complete disintegration and the rise of various successor states.
3. The economic prosperity of the Vijayanagara Empire was primarily based on its control of lucrative spice trade routes connecting the East Coast to West Asian and European markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire employed a system of decentralized administration through Amara Nayakas, who were granted considerable autonomy in their respective provinces. This system facilitated the efficient governance of a vast territory, but also created potential for internal conflicts and the eventual weakening of central authority.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Battle of Talikota in 1565 dealt a devastating blow to the Vijayanagara Empire, leading to the destruction of its capital, it didn't mark the immediate and complete end of the empire.  While the empire significantly declined, some fragments continued to exist for a time. The statement oversimplifies the complexities of the empire's decline and the emergence of successor states.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Vijayanagara Empire's economic strength significantly benefited from its control over trade routes, particularly those dealing in spices.  This control allowed the empire to accumulate significant wealth, which fueled its military strength and cultural development.  While other economic activities contributed, the spice trade played a particularly prominent role.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Group of Monuments at Hampi, a testament to the Vijayanagara Empire's architectural prowess, is recognized for its extensive temple complexes, palaces, and other structures, reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences.
2.  The Ajanta Caves, renowned for their exquisite murals and sculptures, are located in the state of Karnataka and showcase the evolution of early Buddhist art in India.
3. The Sun Temple at Konark, a masterpiece of Kalinga architecture, is known for its intricate carvings depicting scenes from Hindu mythology and its unique design incorporating astronomical features.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Group of Monuments at Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage site accurately described in the statement. The statement correctly identifies the site's significance and its architectural features, reflecting a combination of indigenous and foreign influences.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ajanta Caves, famed for their Buddhist cave paintings and sculptures, are located in Maharashtra, not Karnataka.  This constitutes a significant geographical error, making the statement false.

Statement 3 is correct. The Sun Temple at Konark is indeed a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the statement correctly describes its architectural style (Kalinga), its artistic features (intricate carvings and mythological depictions), and its astronomical aspects.


**4. With reference to classical Indian languages, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia are all listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution and were declared classical languages in the same year.
2.  The declaration of a language as a "classical language" is based on a set of clearly defined criteria established by the government of India, which includes factors such as antiquity, rich literary heritage, and enduring influence on later languages.
3. Sanskrit, being the oldest of the classical languages, has had the most significant and direct impact on the development of other Indian languages, including the Dravidian languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While all six languages (Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia) are listed in the Eighth Schedule and are recognized as classical languages, they were not declared in the same year. Each language received this designation at different times.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  There isn't a formally codified, universally agreed-upon set of criteria for declaring a language as "classical." The process involves a degree of subjective assessment based on various factors like antiquity and the extent of its literary tradition.  The statement misrepresents the reality of the declaration process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sanskrit has significantly influenced many Indian languages, the statement's claim of the *most* significant and *direct* impact on all other languages, including Dravidian ones, is a generalization. The influence of Sanskrit on various languages varies in degree and nature.  The relationship between Sanskrit and Dravidian languages is complex and involves both influence and independent development.


**5. With reference to the Dhangar community, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dhangar community, predominantly residing in Maharashtra, are primarily engaged in agriculture, with a small percentage involved in pastoral activities.
2.  The Dhangars are recognized as a Scheduled Tribe under the Indian Constitution, granting them certain constitutional safeguards and benefits.
3.  The demand for a "grazing corridor" highlights the challenges faced by the Dhangar community in maintaining their traditional pastoral lifestyle in the face of increasing urbanization and land use changes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dhangar community is primarily known for its pastoral lifestyle, not agriculture. While some Dhangars may engage in agriculture, their core identity and livelihood are tied to shepherding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dhangars are listed under the Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJNT) category in Maharashtra, not as a Scheduled Tribe at the national level.  This distinction is crucial in understanding their rights and entitlements.

Statement 3 is correct. The demand for a grazing corridor directly addresses the challenges the Dhangar community faces in balancing their traditional pastoral practices with the pressures of urbanization and changing land use patterns.  This demand highlights the conflict between traditional livelihoods and modern development.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) on Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in India, based on the provided target content.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**23. With reference to Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  RRBs were established primarily to address the credit needs of small and marginal farmers in rural areas, as recommended by the Narasimham Working Group.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the sole regulatory authority for RRBs, and NABARD plays a purely advisory role.
3.  The equity of RRBs is shared among the Central Government, State Governments, and Sponsor Banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The establishment of RRBs was indeed a significant step towards addressing the credit needs of small and marginal farmers in rural India.  While the Narasimham Working Group (1991 and 1998) focused on banking sector reforms, including the strengthening of RRBs, the initial impetus for the creation of RRBs came from the Narasimhan Committee (1975) and the recommendations of the earlier committee.  These recommendations highlighted the need for a specialized banking institution catering to the underserved rural population. The goal was to increase financial inclusion and provide credit for agricultural activities and rural development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI and NABARD both play crucial roles in the regulation and supervision of RRBs. The RBI acts as the primary regulator, overseeing monetary policy aspects, banking regulations, and overall financial stability. NABARD, however, plays a significant role in supervising the credit functions of RRBs, providing refinance, and promoting rural development initiatives.  Their roles are complementary, not mutually exclusive.

Statement 3 is correct. RRBs have a unique ownership structure.  Their equity is jointly held by the Central Government, the concerned State Government, and a Sponsor Bank (usually a Public Sector Bank). This tripartite ownership structure ensures a balance of interests and facilitates effective coordination between the central and state governments in promoting rural development.


**24. With reference to the regulatory framework of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The priority sector lending (PSL) targets for RRBs are set by the finance ministry.
2.  The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) is the principal implementing entity for the Government of India's financial inclusion initiatives related to RRBs.
3.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sets the PSL targets for RRBs and also regulates their overall functioning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the finance ministry has an overarching role in the financial policy of the nation, including agricultural credit, the specific PSL targets for RRBs are set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The RBI, as the primary banking regulator, considers various factors such as economic conditions and the RRBs' capacity when determining these targets.

Organ harvesting from living donors is permitted only under specific conditions, primarily focusing on close familial relationships to prevent exploitation.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Act has strict guidelines about living donors and their relationship to the recipient.  The Act explicitly criminalizes the commercial dealing in human organs, making their sale and purchase illegal. Statement 2 is incorrect as the Act prohibits the commercial trade of human organs.  While NOTTO plays a crucial role, the enforcement of the Act involves multiple agencies, including state governments and law enforcement.  Statement 3 is incorrect as enforcement is a multi-agency responsibility.  Thus, none of the statements are correct, highlighting the ethical and legal complexities surrounding organ transplantation in India.


**4. With reference to India's policy on refugees, consider the following statements:**

1. India has a comprehensive national refugee policy that explicitly defines the rights and responsibilities of refugees.
2. India is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.
3.  The UNHCR has significant operational authority within India to manage refugee affairs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India does not currently have a comprehensive national refugee policy.  While India has historically provided refuge to many, its approach is largely ad hoc and based on humanitarian considerations rather than a codified legal framework.  Statement 1 is incorrect because a formal national refugee policy is absent.  India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. Its approach to refugees is based on bilateral agreements and humanitarian considerations. Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNHCR's operational authority within India is limited; its role is primarily advisory and dependent on the Indian government's willingness to cooperate. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, none of the statements accurately describe India's current position on refugee policy.  This highlights the ongoing debate about the need for a clear and comprehensive national refugee policy in India.


**5. With reference to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), consider the following statements:**

1. The JPC's recommendations are legally binding on the government and must be implemented.
2.  A JPC can only be constituted to investigate matters related to financial irregularities.
3.  The JPC comprises members from both Houses of Parliament but is entirely composed of members from the ruling party.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The recommendations of a JPC are not legally binding on the government. While they carry significant weight and influence, the government is not obligated to accept or implement them. Statement 1 is incorrect because JPC recommendations are not legally binding. JPCs are not limited to investigating financial irregularities; they can be formed to examine a wide range of issues of public importance. Statement 2 is incorrect.  JPCs include members from both the ruling and opposition parties, ensuring a degree of bipartisan representation.  Statement 3 is incorrect as it is composed of members from both ruling and opposition parties.  Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the nature and function of a JPC. This underscores the importance of understanding the limitations of parliamentary committees in influencing government policy.


**6. With reference to Article 67 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. It deals with the procedure for the removal of the President of India.
2. It outlines the powers and privileges of the Vice President.
3. It specifies the method for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 67 of the Indian Constitution does not deal with the removal of the President; that is covered under a different article. Statement 1 is incorrect. It also doesn't detail the powers and privileges of the Vice President, focusing instead on the procedures for filling vacancies. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 67 primarily addresses the procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, including the timing of elections and the process of appointing a temporary acting Vice President. Statement 3 is correct.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.  This highlights the need for precise knowledge of the specific content of each constitutional article.


**7.  With reference to Senior Advocates, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Advocates Act, 1961, mandates a minimum age of 50 years for applying for the designation of Senior Advocate.
2.  Only the Supreme Court can confer the designation of Senior Advocate.
3.  The designation of Senior Advocate is granted based solely on the number of years of practice.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Advocates Act, 1961, does not specify a minimum age of 50 for applying for the designation of Senior Advocate; the minimum age is lower. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court plays a significant role, High Courts can also confer the designation of Senior Advocate. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The designation is not based solely on years of practice; it considers various factors, including expertise, contributions to the legal field, and reputation.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, none of the statements are accurate. This highlights the multi-faceted criteria for becoming a Senior Advocate in India.


**8. With reference to the Cabinet Secretary of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet Secretary is appointed by the President of India.
2. The Cabinet Secretary directly supervises the day-to-day functioning of all individual ministries.
3. The Cabinet Secretary is the ex-officio chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Cabinet Secretary is appointed by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), not directly by the President. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cabinet Secretary does not directly supervise the day-to-day functioning of individual ministries; their role is more focused on coordination and inter-ministerial communication. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cabinet Secretary is not the ex-officio chairman of the Public Accounts Committee; that position is held by a Member of Parliament. Statement 3 is incorrect. Therefore, none of the statements are correct. This illustrates the nuanced role of the Cabinet Secretary in the Indian administrative system.


**9. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is a set of rules enforced through specific provisions within the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
2.  The MCC applies only to national elections and not to state or local elections.
3. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has no power to enforce the MCC.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the MCC is closely related to the Representation of the People Act, 1951, it's not explicitly codified within the Act itself; it's a set of guidelines. Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC applies to all elections, including state and local body elections, to ensure a level playing field. Statement 2 is incorrect. The ECI has the authority to enforce the MCC through its own powers and by invoking relevant provisions in other statutes. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the legal status and application of the MCC.  This highlights the importance of understanding the quasi-legal nature of the MCC and its enforcement mechanisms.


**10. With reference to Plea Bargaining in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Plea bargaining is applicable to all types of criminal offenses.
2.  The accused, under plea bargaining, forfeits their right to a full trial.
3.  Plea bargaining is exclusively governed by the Indian Penal Code (IPC).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Plea bargaining is not applicable to all types of criminal offenses; there are specific exclusions, particularly for serious crimes. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While plea bargaining involves a negotiation that may lead to a reduced sentence, it doesn't entirely eliminate the right to a trial; the accused must agree to the terms. Statement 2 is partially correct, but oversimplifies the process.  Plea bargaining is not solely governed by the IPC; it's regulated through provisions within the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and other relevant laws. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, none of the statements fully and accurately describe plea bargaining in India.  This highlights the limitations and specific conditions under which plea bargaining is permissible.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is false because while the MHA is involved in the overall process of implementing Citizenship rules, the Rules are not solely handled by the Counterterrorism Division. Other divisions and departments within the MHA and other ministries are involved.  Statement 2 is false; although the MHA has significant responsibility for Union Territories,  it does not control legislative matters entirely.  The President, Parliament, and other ministries hold certain powers regarding Union Territories' administration. Statement 3 is false; the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India falls under the administrative umbrella of the MHA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect because while the MHA played a key role in drafting the Model Prisons Act, 2023,  the Act's final form is subject to parliamentary scrutiny and possible amendments before becoming law. Statement 2 is incorrect because, although the MHA enforces the UAPA, the declaration of an organization as unlawful involves a process that includes judicial review.  The MHA does not have the sole authority. Statement 3 is incorrect because, while the MHA is associated with the Inter-State Council,  the council's functioning is ultimately subject to parliamentary oversight and the broader constitutional framework.


**4. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India's original jurisdiction is limited to disputes between the central government and state governments only.
2.  The Supreme Court of India exclusively defines the scope of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and its admissibility.
3. The Chief Justice of India (CJI) is solely responsible for appointing all judges to the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false because the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction extends beyond disputes between the Centre and states.  It also includes matters concerning fundamental rights and other constitutional issues. Statement 2 is false as the scope of PIL has evolved through various judgments and interpretations, not solely defined by the Supreme Court.  Statement 3 is false. While the CJI plays a crucial role, the appointment of judges involves a collegium system involving other senior judges.


**5. With reference to the Election Commission of India (ECI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is a legally binding document enforced solely by the ECI through its own internal mechanisms.
2. The ECI has absolute authority to cancel elections at any stage without any recourse or review.
3. The ECI is completely independent of the Government of India and does not require any government approval for its decisions and actions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct. Statement 1 is false; the MCC, while enforced primarily by the ECI, is not a legally binding statute in itself. Its provisions are enforced through other laws. Statement 2 is false; while the ECI has significant powers, its decisions are subject to judicial review and constitutional constraints.  Statement 3 is false because the ECI, while enjoying considerable autonomy, operates within the broader framework of the Constitution and is accountable to Parliament and the judiciary to some extent.  Its budget and other administrative matters are still subject to government processes.


**6. Consider the following statements about the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC):**

1. The NAPCC was launched in 2018 with a primary focus on achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Western Ghats and related geographical features.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Western Ghats:**

1. The Western Ghats are primarily composed of laterite soil, contributing to their unique biodiversity.
2.  The Sahyadri range, also known as the Western Ghats, forms a continuous mountain range along India's west coast.
3. The Western Ghats' steep gradient contributes to rapid water flow, influencing river systems and drainage patterns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While laterite soils are found in parts of the Western Ghats, the mountain range's diverse geology includes a variety of soil types, influenced by factors like parent material, climate, and topography.  The biodiversity of the Western Ghats is a result of complex interplay of several factors including geology, climate, and geographic isolation, not solely laterite soil.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sahyadri range is another name for the Western Ghats, but the range is not entirely continuous. It features gaps and breaks, notably the Palghat Gap, which significantly affects the region's climatic patterns and biodiversity.

Statement 3 is correct. The Western Ghats are characterized by a steep gradient, leading to rapid water flow in its river systems. This contributes to the formation of numerous waterfalls and the swift movement of water, impacting erosion patterns and the overall hydrological dynamics of the region. The rapid flow also contributes to the formation of gorges and valleys.


**2. With reference to the geographical features of peninsular India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats converge with the Eastern Ghats near the Godavari River basin, creating a significant geographical divide.
2. The Western Ghats are primarily responsible for the orographic rainfall experienced along the Malabar Coast, creating a rain shadow effect on the eastern side.
3. The highest peak of the Western Ghats, Anamudi, is located in the state of Tamil Nadu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Western and Eastern Ghats do not converge at a single point. They are distinct ranges, and their interaction is complex and spread across a wide area. The Godavari River basin lies east of the Western Ghats, but the convergence is not a defining feature of their relationship.

Statement 2 is correct. The Western Ghats play a crucial role in the orographic rainfall along the western coast of India (Malabar Coast). The mountains intercept the moisture-laden monsoon winds, forcing them to rise and cool, leading to heavy precipitation. The rain shadow effect on the eastern side results in relatively drier conditions compared to the western slopes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Anamudi, the highest peak in the Western Ghats, is situated in the state of Kerala, not Tamil Nadu.  Tamil Nadu experiences the rain shadow effect of the Western Ghats, leading to lower rainfall in the eastern parts of the state.


**3. With reference to the ecological sensitivity of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats Expert Ecology Panel (WGEEP) report recommended the declaration of 60,000 sq km as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA).
2. The Central Government's draft notification, declaring a portion of the Western Ghats as an ESA, included the entire state of Karnataka within the designated area.
3. The Western Ghats are a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognized for their exceptional biodiversity and ecological significance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the exact area proposed by the WGEEP varied slightly in different iterations of their reports, the core recommendation was in the range of 60,000 sq km.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although a significant portion of the Western Ghats lies within Karnataka, the Central Government's draft notification did not include the entire state of Karnataka in the ecologically sensitive area.  The notification specified particular areas within the Western Ghats across multiple states based on ecological criteria.

Statement 3 is correct. The Western Ghats are indeed a UNESCO World Heritage site, acknowledged for their outstanding universal value in terms of biodiversity and ecological processes.  This recognition highlights their global significance and the need for their conservation.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Western Ghats:**

1. The Western Ghats support a variety of forest types, including tropical wet evergreen forests and sub-tropical moist pine forests.
2.  The Tungabhadra River, which originates in the Western Ghats, forms a significant part of the boundary between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
3.  The Western Ghats are primarily responsible for the rain shadow effect experienced along the Tamil Nadu coast.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats exhibit remarkable biodiversity and support a wide range of forest types.  Tropical wet evergreen forests are found in the wetter regions, while sub-tropical moist pine forests can be found at higher elevations, showcasing a diverse range of ecosystems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Tungabhadra River originates from the confluence of the Tunga and Bhadra rivers in the Western Ghats, but it does not primarily form the boundary between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.  The river flows through both states, but the boundary is more complex and not solely defined by the Tungabhadra River.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Western Ghats influence the rainfall patterns of Tamil Nadu, creating a rain shadow effect on the leeward side, it is not solely responsible.  Other factors like the location of the state and other climatic processes also influence its rainfall. The rain shadow effect is more pronounced in some parts of Tamil Nadu than others.


**5. With reference to the Western Ghats and their impact on surrounding regions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats significantly influence wind patterns, particularly the monsoon winds, leading to variations in rainfall across peninsular India.
2. The Western Ghats are susceptible to landslides due to their steep slopes and high rainfall, posing a significant natural hazard.
3. The city of Mumbai is situated in a rain shadow region created by the Western Ghats, leading to relatively lower rainfall.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats act as a significant barrier to the monsoon winds, causing orographic rainfall.  The mountains also influence the direction and speed of the winds, resulting in variations in rainfall across peninsular India. The windward side receives high rainfall, while the leeward side experiences a rain-shadow effect, influencing regional climates.

Statement 2 is correct. The combination of steep slopes and high rainfall in the Western Ghats makes them highly susceptible to landslides.  Deforestation and other human activities exacerbate this risk, posing a significant threat to the environment and human settlements. Landslides frequently disrupt transportation and infrastructure in the region.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Mumbai is located on the western coast, on the windward side of the Western Ghats, and receives significant orographic rainfall.  It does not lie in a rain shadow region. Rain shadow areas are typically found on the eastern side of the mountain range.

1. The South China Sea is a marginal sea of the Indian Ocean, located between southern China and Southeast Asian countries.
2. The Malacca Strait, situated between Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, serves as a crucial maritime gateway and choke point for the South China Sea.
3. Tensions in the South China Sea primarily involve China, the Philippines, and Vietnam, posing a significant threat to global trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The South China Sea is a marginal sea of the *Western Pacific Ocean*, not the Indian Ocean.  Statement 2 is correct. The Malacca Strait is indeed a significant choke point for shipping in the region, connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  Statement 3 is partially correct. While tensions involve China, the Philippines, and Vietnam,  the statement oversimplifies the complex geopolitical dynamics of the South China Sea.  Taiwan is also a major player, and the threat to global trade is multifaceted, not solely from these three countries.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are partially correct, but 2 is more accurate.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Poland does share borders with the countries listed; however, it’s the *northern* border that is 440 km long and runs along the Baltic Sea coast, not the southern one.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Warsaw is inland; it doesn't lie on the Baltic Sea coast. Statement 3 is correct.  The information about Prime Minister Modi's visit is accurate.  Therefore, only statements 1 (partially) and 3 are correct.


**7. With reference to the Gumti River, consider the following statements:**

(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Philadelphi Corridor is a 14km stretch along Gaza's border with Egypt, crucial for ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Statement 2 is incorrect.  It was built by the *Israeli* military, not the Egyptian military.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the 1979 agreement was a significant event, the Philadelphi Corridor's construction occurred later, during Israel's direct occupation of Gaza. Therefore, only statement 1 is partially correct.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Before the secession of South Sudan, Sudan was the largest country in Africa; now it is the third largest, not the second largest.  Statement 2 is correct. The bordering countries and water body are accurately listed. Statement 3 is correct. The confluence of the White and Blue Niles in Khartoum and their subsequent flow to the Mediterranean are accurate.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**13. With reference to Cyclone formation, consider the following statements:**

1. Cyclones form over cold ocean waters; the coldness provides the necessary heat and moisture to fuel the cyclone.
2.  The rotation of the Earth (Coriolis effect) causes the rising air to spin around the low-pressure center, leading to cyclonic circulation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nirbhaya Fund is administered by the *Ministry of Women and Child Development*, and it is a *non-lapsable* fund.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The fund is used for projects enhancing women's safety and security across both urban and rural areas. Statement 3 is incorrect. While women's empowerment is a broader goal, the fund's primary focus is on safety and security initiatives, not education or healthcare. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AMRUT was launched in 2015, not 2010, and its 2.0 version was launched in 2021. Statement 2 is incorrect.  AMRUT did not cover *all* cities and towns with populations over one lakh; its coverage was more selective. Statement 3 is partially correct. The aim was to provide access to water and sewerage, but the 24x7 supply was a goal, not necessarily a uniform achievement across all covered areas.  Therefore, only one statement is partially correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NIRF ranking methodology utilizes a weighted average across multiple parameters, with Teaching & Learning having the highest weightage.
2.  The Ministry of Education exclusively oversees the NIRF rankings, without any input from other government bodies or independent experts.
3.  The NIRF rankings include only higher educational institutions, excluding schools and other educational settings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NIRF uses a weighted average, the highest weightage isn't solely assigned to Teaching & Learning. The framework considers multiple parameters such as Teaching, Learning & Resources, Research and Professional Practices, Graduation Outcomes, Outreach and Inclusivity, and Perception.  The exact weightage for each parameter varies across categories.  This makes statement 1 a misleading distractor playing on the general knowledge that teaching and learning is crucial in higher education.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although the Ministry of Education is the primary implementing body, the NIRF ranking process involves consultations with various stakeholders, including experts from different fields and other relevant government organizations.  The claim of exclusive oversight is a deliberate inaccuracy designed to test the candidate's understanding of the collaborative nature of the ranking process.


Statement 3 is correct. The NIRF specifically focuses on ranking institutions of higher education in India.  It does not include schools or other pre-tertiary educational institutions.  This is a straightforward fact that tests factual recall.


**2. With reference to the Ministry of Education's involvement in educational initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ministry of Education solely manages the PM SHRI Schools scheme without any collaborative efforts from state governments or other ministries.
2.  The Samagra Siksha Abhiyaan, administered by the Ministry of Education, focuses exclusively on primary education, excluding secondary and higher education.
3.  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, implemented by the Ministry of Education, has not faced any significant criticisms or challenges since its adoption.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM SHRI Schools scheme, while managed by the Ministry of Education, involves collaboration with state governments and other stakeholders to ensure effective implementation across different regions of the country. This showcases a misunderstanding of collaborative governance models in education.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Samagra Siksha Abhiyaan is a comprehensive scheme that aims to improve the quality of education at all levels, from primary to secondary education. This is a factual inaccuracy, designed to test the candidate's in-depth knowledge of this scheme.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NEP 2020, since its introduction, has been subject to considerable debate and criticism, raising issues related to implementation, curriculum design, and its potential impact on various aspects of the education system.  This statement is a misleading distractor, testing the candidate's awareness of current educational policy discussions.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana primarily focuses on promoting the use of electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions.
2. The scheme's implementation is solely handled by a single technical body under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, with no involvement from other agencies.
3.  The scheme's initial implementation period has been extended indefinitely, with no set end date.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana (JI-VAN stands for  "Jivandani") focuses on promoting biofuels, particularly 2G ethanol,  to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enhance energy security. This statement attempts to confuse the candidate by substituting a related but incorrect focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a technical body under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change plays a significant role, the scheme's implementation likely involves coordination with other ministries and agencies to ensure effective policy integration. This tests the candidate's understanding of inter-ministerial coordination.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the scheme's implementation period has been extended, it has a defined end date (2028-29 as per the provided text), unlike the indefinite extension suggested in the statement. This tests factual recall of specific details.


**4. With reference to the Jiyo Parsi Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme was launched in 2013-14 and is funded entirely by the state governments.
2. The scheme's primary objective is to increase the Parsi population through incentives for childbirth.
3. The scheme comprises three main components: Medical Assistance, Advocacy, and Community Health initiatives.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme, launched in 2013-14, is a Central Sector Scheme, meaning it's primarily funded by the central government. The statement incorrectly attributes funding to state governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the scheme aims to counter the declining Parsi population, its focus is on providing support for community well-being and healthcare, not directly incentivizing childbirth. This aims to test a nuanced understanding of the scheme's goals.

Statement 3 is correct. The scheme indeed has three components: Medical Assistance, Advocacy, and Community Health initiatives aimed at improving the overall health and well-being of the Parsi community. This tests factual recall of the scheme's structure.


**5.  With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are fully funded by the Union Government, with state governments having no financial contribution.
2. The definition of CSSs is solely based on the Baijal Committee Report of 1987, and no subsequent modifications have been made.
3.  CSSs are implemented across all sectors without any restrictions based on the Constitution's division of powers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs involve cost-sharing between the Union and State Governments, with the proportion varying depending on the scheme and other factors. The statement falsely presents CSSs as solely centrally funded.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Baijal Committee Report of 1987 is significant, the definition and implementation of CSSs have evolved over time, with various modifications and clarifications issued by the government.  This tests awareness of evolving government policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. CSSs are typically implemented in sectors defined by the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, reflecting the federal structure of India's governance.  The statement ignores the constitutional constraints on central government involvement.


**6. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on the training and development of senior bureaucrats, neglecting other levels of civil servants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi aims to enhance the capacity of all levels of civil servants, not just senior bureaucrats. This statement is a deliberate misrepresentation of the program's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi utilizes a blended learning approach, integrating on-site learning with online platforms like iGOT Karmayogi to provide a comprehensive training experience. The statement incorrectly portrays the training methods as solely traditional.

Statement 3 is correct. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) is integral to Mission Karmayogi's implementation and oversight, contributing to its overall effectiveness. This tests factual knowledge about the program's structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ONDC was indeed launched in 2022 by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), under the Ministry of Commerce & Industry. Its goal is to create a more open and competitive e-commerce ecosystem.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ONDC aims to level the playing field, providing opportunities for MSMEs and small retailers to participate in digital commerce, thereby challenging the dominance of large corporations.  This tests the candidate's understanding of ONDC's policy objective.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the government initiated ONDC, it's designed to be an open network involving both public and private sector participation.  This statement is a misleading distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of public-private partnerships.


**8. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMJDY was launched in 2014 to promote financial inclusion by providing basic banking services.
2.  PMJDY accounts require a mandatory minimum balance of ₹500 to remain active.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PMJDY was launched in 2014 with the primary goal of promoting financial inclusion, particularly among previously unbanked populations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PMJDY accounts do *not* require a minimum balance.  This is a significant factual inaccuracy designed to test the candidate's detailed understanding of the scheme.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PMJDY aims for broad financial inclusion, encompassing both urban and rural populations.  This statement is a misleading distractor, playing on potential biases in understanding the scheme's reach.


**9. With reference to the National Quantum Mission (NQM), consider the following statements:**

1. The NQM aims to establish a nationwide quantum communication network spanning 5,000 kilometers.
2.  The NQM is entirely funded by private sector investments, without any government financial support.
3. The mission's duration is limited to a five-year period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NQM aims for a significant quantum communication network, the stated size of 5,000 kilometers is exaggerated. The actual target is smaller, testing the candidate's attention to detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NQM is a government-initiated mission, receiving substantial funding from the government's budget. This statement is a significant factual error, aiming to test understanding of funding sources.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NQM has a longer implementation period than five years (2023-2031 as per the source). This tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about the program's timeline.


**10. With reference to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides a 5% interest subvention on loans for post-harvest management infrastructure.
2.  Loans under the AIF are not covered by any credit guarantee mechanism.
3. The AIF corpus is entirely provided as grants by the central government, with no loan components.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF offers a 3% interest subvention, not 5%.  This is a minor numerical inaccuracy intended to test precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Loans under the AIF *are* covered by credit guarantees, specifically under the CGTMSE for amounts up to ₹2 Crores. This tests the candidate's understanding of risk mitigation mechanisms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The AIF corpus is primarily mobilized through loans from banks and financial institutions, not solely through grants.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the funding model.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text clearly states that the VDG scheme, initially launched in 1995 in ten Jammu districts to address targeting of the Hindu community, was revived in 2022 due to a resurgence of terrorist activities.  The revival after a gap of more than 20 years is also explicitly mentioned.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifies that VDGs are headed by a *retired* officer from the Army/CPMF/J&K Police, not a serving officer. This subtle difference is crucial for accurate understanding of the scheme's structure and authority.  The use of "serving" instead of "retired" is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text highlights that the provision of sophisticated weapons to VDGs is to address terrorism in the Jammu region, emphasizing its *localized* nature rather than a nationwide deployment. Describing it as a nationwide initiative is a significant misrepresentation of the scheme's scope.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revised scheme, approved in 2024, extends its implementation timeline to 2027-28 and focuses solely on bioethanol production from sugarcane.
2.  The scheme aims to enhance India's energy independence and reduce environmental pollution by utilizing agricultural residues, but excludes industrial waste.
3.  "Bolt-on" plants, which expand existing facilities, are ineligible for support under the modified scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the scheme's implementation timeline is indeed extended, the text clarifies it runs until 2028-29, not 2027-28.  Furthermore, the scheme's scope extends beyond sugarcane to include advanced biofuels from various lignocellulosic feedstocks like agricultural and forestry residues, industrial waste, and algae.  The focus on solely sugarcane is a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme explicitly aims to address environmental pollution and improve India's energy security by utilizing not only agricultural residues but also industrial waste.  The exclusion of industrial waste is factually incorrect.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The modified scheme specifically includes "bolt-on" plants and "brownfield projects" to leverage their existing infrastructure and improve viability.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual policy.


**3. With reference to the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The scheme's age range for beneficiaries is 21-65 years, not 18-60 years, and the family income limit is ₹2.5 lakh, not ₹2 lakh.  These minor numerical differences are designed to test precise recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bombay High Court explicitly stated that the scheme is *not* discriminatory.  The reversal of the court's judgment is a key distractor.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly mentions that ₹1,500 is transferred into the bank accounts of eligible women.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI was launched by the Ministry of Culture, not Tourism. The statement's alteration of the implementing ministry is a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Project PARI is managed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, not the National Museum and IGNCA.  The substitution of managing organizations creates confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly lists Warli art, Gond art, and Tanjore paintings as examples of art forms included in Project PARI.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NIRF was launched in 2015, not 2016, by the Ministry of Education (it was renamed from MHRD), and it uses 18 parameters, not 15.  The alteration of both the year and number of parameters are designed to be misleading.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly states that 'Teaching, Learning & Resources' and 'Research and Professional Practice' each have a weightage of 0.30.

Statement 3 is correct. 'Perception' is explicitly mentioned as one of the five broad categories used in the NIRF ranking.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PMAY-U scheme aims to construct 1 crore houses, not 2 crore.  The inflated number of houses is a key distractor.

(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Amrit Gyan Kosh portal was launched under Mission Karmayogi, but it employs a blended learning approach, not solely traditional classroom training.  The mischaracterization of the learning method is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The portal caters to the training and development needs of all civil servants, from entry-level to senior positions, not just senior-level officers.  The limitation of the portal's scope is a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct.  Mission Karmayogi, and thus the Amrit Gyan Kosh portal, emphasizes a blended learning approach, utilizing both digital platforms and offline components.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme was launched in 2013-14, not 2012-13, and it aims to *reverse the declining trend* of the Parsi population, not increase it. The incorrect launch year and misrepresentation of the objective are deliberate distractors.

(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs involve *shared* funding between the Centre and States, with varying ratios (50:50, 70:30, etc.), not complete central funding.  The misrepresentation of the funding mechanism is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are formulated on subjects from the State List, encouraging state participation in areas needing attention.  The incorrect specification of the subject list is a deliberate attempt to confuse.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Methylocucumis oryzae does oxidize methane, but the product is carbon dioxide, which is *also* a potent greenhouse gas, although less potent than methane.  The net effect is still a reduction in global warming potential, but the statement misrepresents the process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Global Methane Pledge does indeed aim for a significant reduction in methane emissions (although the exact percentage might vary slightly depending on the source and may be expressed differently, such as a reduction of 45% by 2030). While it does encompass various sectors, the energy sector is a major focus.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While agriculture is a significant source of methane, it is not necessarily significantly less than the industrial sector;  the relative contribution of these sectors can vary depending on the region and methodology used for calculation.  The statement oversimplifies a complex issue.


**4. With reference to Ground Level Ozone (GLO), consider the following statements:**

1. GLO is a primary pollutant directly emitted from vehicles and industrial sources, contributing significantly to respiratory illnesses.
2.  The formation of GLO requires sunlight and high temperatures to trigger photochemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
3.  GLO levels are generally higher in rural areas due to the abundance of natural VOC emissions from vegetation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GLO is a *secondary* pollutant, meaning it's not directly emitted but formed through chemical reactions in the atmosphere. While vehicles and industries contribute to the precursors (NOx and VOCs), GLO itself is not a primary emission.

Statement 2 is correct. The photochemical process of GLO formation explicitly requires sunlight and sufficient temperature to facilitate the chemical reactions between NOx and VOCs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. GLO levels are generally higher in urban and suburban areas due to higher concentrations of NOx and VOCs from anthropogenic sources (human activities).  Rural areas typically have lower GLO levels.


**5. Consider the following statements about Ramsar sites:**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's primary function is regulating the insurance sector in India.
2. The RBI's monetary policy decisions directly influence the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
3. The RBI was established in 1947, based on the recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a crucial role in the overall financial stability of the nation impacting the insurance sector indirectly, its primary regulatory responsibility lies with currency, credit, and banking operations.  The insurance sector is primarily regulated by IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India).

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's monetary policy tools, such as repo rates and reverse repo rates, directly impact inflation and, consequently, the WPI, a key measure of inflation in India.  Changes in interest rates influence borrowing costs, investment, and overall economic activity, all of which are reflected in the WPI.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI was established on April 1, 1935, under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  The Hilton Young Commission's recommendations formed the basis for the establishment of the RBI, but the actual establishment date is 1935, not 1947.  The RBI was nationalized in 1949.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's role in agricultural development primarily involves regulating agricultural commodity markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI's policies indirectly influence agricultural credit and thus affect agricultural development, its role isn't primarily focused on regulating agricultural commodity markets.  Other government agencies and bodies are more directly involved in regulating these markets.  The RBI's impact is through credit availability and interest rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CPI is an important indicator of inflation, the RBI considers multiple indicators, including the WPI and other economic data, when making monetary policy decisions.  It doesn't rely exclusively on the CPI.

Statement 3 is correct. The RBI, as the central bank, holds significant regulatory power over commercial banks in India. This includes setting guidelines and norms for branch expansion, mergers, and acquisitions, ensuring the stability and soundness of the banking system.


**3. With reference to the functions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio) mandates that banks maintain a certain percentage of their deposits in liquid assets. While this influences lending capacity, it doesn't directly control the amount banks lend to the government. Government borrowing is influenced by various factors, including fiscal policy.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI provides the framework and guidelines for ICAs, their implementation and enforcement involve multiple stakeholders, including banks and other financial institutions involved in the lending process. It is a collaborative effort to resolve stressed assets.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. SEBI's Foreign Venture Capital Investors (Amendment) Regulations, 2024, mandate a minimum investment commitment for all foreign investors.
2. The Mutual Funds Regulations, 1996, were enacted by SEBI to regulate the investment advisory services.
3. SEBI regulates front-running, a type of insider trading, but not pump-and-dump schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While SEBI does regulate foreign venture capital investors, the statement misrepresents the regulations by implying a specific minimum investment commitment which is not a universal requirement across all categories of foreign investors.  The regulations cover various aspects of registration, compliance, and reporting, but a universal minimum investment amount is not a core element.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mutual Funds Regulations, 1996, primarily focus on the regulation of mutual funds themselves, including their structure, operations, and investor protection.  While mutual fund *managers* may offer investment advisory services, the regulations themselves aren't the primary instrument for governing *all* investment advisory services.  SEBI has separate regulations for investment advisors.

Statement 3 is correct.  SEBI actively combats front-running, which involves trading securities based on non-public information about upcoming large trades.  Pump-and-dump schemes, however, are a form of market manipulation primarily tackled by other regulatory mechanisms and investigations, although SEBI might be involved in certain aspects.  The primary regulatory focus on pump-and-dump schemes often lies with agencies focused on securities fraud.


**2. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Fiscal deficit is calculated by subtracting total revenue receipts from total expenditure, including borrowings.
2.  A revenue deficit is always smaller than the fiscal deficit in a given fiscal year.
3.  Disinvestment of public sector undertakings can contribute to a reduction in the fiscal deficit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The fiscal deficit is indeed calculated as the difference between total government expenditure (revenue and capital) and total government receipts (revenue and capital), *including* borrowings.  Borrowings are a crucial component of financing the fiscal deficit.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While a revenue deficit (the difference between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts) is often a *component* of the fiscal deficit, it's not guaranteed to be smaller.  The fiscal deficit can be significantly larger if there is substantial capital expenditure not covered by capital receipts.  The relationship between the two depends on the overall budgetary allocations and revenue generation.

Statement 3 is correct. Disinvestment, which involves selling off government shares in public sector undertakings, leads to an inflow of revenue for the government. This inflow directly reduces the fiscal deficit, as it contributes towards covering the difference between expenditure and receipts.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI Act, 1934, empowers the RBI to regulate Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) but not Microfinance Institutions (MFIs).
2. The RBI's monetary policy primarily focuses on managing inflation and exchange rate stability.
3. The RBI issues currency notes but does not regulate credit information companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI does regulate both NBFCs and MFIs, albeit under different regulatory frameworks and with varying degrees of oversight.  The RBI's regulatory power extends to a broad range of financial institutions to maintain financial stability.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary mandate of the RBI's monetary policy is indeed price stability (managing inflation) and maintaining macroeconomic stability, a key component of which is exchange rate stability.  These are central to the RBI's goals and actions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The RBI is responsible for issuing currency notes and managing the nation's currency.  Furthermore, the RBI also regulates Credit Information Companies (CICs) to ensure the accuracy and responsible use of credit information data.  This regulation is critical for maintaining financial integrity and consumer protection.


**4. With reference to Nidhi Companies, consider the following statements:**

1. Nidhi companies are regulated under the Companies Act, 2013, and require a minimum net owned fund of ₹1 crore.
2. Nidhi companies can accept deposits from the general public, subject to certain restrictions.
3. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a significant role in the supervision of Nidhi companies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nidhi companies are indeed regulated under the Companies Act, 2013, specifically under Section 406.  While the exact phrasing might vary slightly, the core idea of needing a minimum net owned fund (similar to capital) is a requirement for their formation. This ensures a certain level of financial soundness.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Nidhi companies are primarily meant to operate within a closed membership system, providing financial assistance to their members.  They are not authorized to accept deposits from the general public, unlike banks or other deposit-taking institutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) is the primary regulatory authority for Nidhi companies; the RBI does not have a direct supervisory role over them.  The MCA oversees their compliance with the Companies Act.


**5. With reference to Precision Farming, consider the following statements:**

1.  Precision farming techniques, such as GPS-guided machinery, are less effective in small and fragmented landholdings typical of Indian agriculture.
2.  Precision farming relies heavily on data analytics to optimize resource allocation and improve crop yields.
3.  Hard precision agriculture exclusively employs sophisticated technologies like GPS, remote sensing, and variable rate technology, excluding simpler methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the adoption of sophisticated precision farming technologies might present initial challenges in small and fragmented landholdings, the underlying principles of precision farming—efficient resource use and targeted interventions—are still highly relevant and adaptable.  Simplified or modified techniques can be effectively applied even in smaller farms.

Statement 2 is correct. Data analytics is indeed a cornerstone of precision farming.  Information on soil conditions, weather patterns, and crop health is collected, analyzed, and used to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, pesticide application, and other agricultural practices. This data-driven approach is crucial for optimization.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The term "hard precision agriculture" is not a standardized term within the field.  While sophisticated technologies are often a part of precision agriculture, the approach encompasses a range of techniques, from simple observation-based practices to advanced technologies. Simpler methods, such as manual soil testing and visual crop assessment, can complement advanced technologies.


**6. With reference to the findings of the ‘Relative Economic Performance of Indian States: 1960-61 to 2023-24’ paper released by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2023-24, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu together contributed approximately 40 percent of India's GDP.
2.  Both Gujarat and Maharashtra consistently maintained per capita incomes above the national average since the 1960s.
3. The EAC-PM report indicates a significant widening of the economic disparity between the top-performing and bottom-performing states in recent years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement alters the percentage of India's GDP contributed by the listed states.  While the mentioned states are significant contributors to India's GDP, the exact percentage reported in the EAC-PM paper needs to be verified, and it's likely to differ from the number stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gujarat and Maharashtra are generally high-performing states,  the statement is an oversimplification.  The EAC-PM's report likely provides nuanced information about the fluctuations in per capita income relative to the national average over time for these states.  It is unlikely to show consistent above-average incomes since the 1960s without interruption.

Statement 3 is correct.  The EAC-PM report, dealing with long-term state economic performance, likely analyzes the evolution of economic disparities across Indian states.  A trend of widening economic gaps between high and low-performing states in recent years is a plausible and frequently discussed observation.


**7. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Council, established under Article 279A, is chaired by the Union Finance Minister.
2. The GST was introduced in 2017 by the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016.
3. A cess is levied only on luxury goods and demerit goods under GST.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST Council is indeed established under Article 279A of the Indian Constitution and is chaired by the Union Finance Minister.  The Council's composition includes representatives from both the central and state governments.

Statement 2 is correct. The GST was introduced in 2017 and is a landmark indirect tax reform in India.  The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016, paved the way for its implementation by making necessary changes to the Constitution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While a cess is levied on luxury and demerit goods, it's not exclusively limited to them.  Cesses can be imposed on other goods as well, depending on policy objectives and requirements.  The statement simplifies the application of cess under GST.



**8. With reference to Retail Inflation, consider the following statements:**

1. Retail inflation is measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
2. When retail inflation decreases, the purchasing power of consumers increases.
3. Retail inflation only considers the price changes in essential consumer goods, not services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Retail inflation is primarily measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks price changes in goods and services consumed by households.  The WPI, on the other hand, measures price changes at the wholesale level.

Statement 2 is correct.  A decrease in retail inflation means that the prices of goods and services are rising at a slower rate or even falling.  This generally increases the purchasing power of consumers, as their money can buy more.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Retail inflation is a broad measure encompassing price changes in both goods *and* services consumed by households.  The CPI includes a wide range of items, including both essential and non-essential goods and services.


**9.  With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), consider the following statements:**

1. SEBI was established as a statutory body in 1992.
2. SEBI is the regulatory authority for securities and commodity markets in India.
3. The National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) is not regulated by SEBI.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  SEBI was established as a statutory body under the SEBI Act, 1992, marking a significant step in regulating India's securities market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEBI regulates the securities market but not commodity markets.  Commodity markets in India fall under the purview of other regulatory bodies.

Statement 3 is correct. The NIIF is a sovereign wealth fund, and it is not directly regulated by SEBI.  While NIIF's investments might involve securities, its overall operations and governance are distinct from SEBI's regulatory domain.  NIIF is regulated by its own governing body.


**10. With reference to the Three Gorges Dam and the Bhakra Nangal Dam, consider the following statements:**

1. The Three Gorges Dam is located on the Yangtze River in China and is the world's largest hydroelectric power station in terms of installed capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Three Gorges Dam, situated on the Yangtze River in China, holds the distinction of being the world's largest hydroelectric power station based on its installed capacity.  This fact is widely known and documented.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bhakra Nangal Dam is located on the Sutlej River in India and is a significant hydroelectric project, it is not the *oldest* hydroelectric power plant in India.  Several older hydroelectric plants exist in India.

Statement 3 is correct.  Both dams play significant roles in flood control in their respective regions. The Three Gorges Dam's massive reservoir helps regulate water flow in the Yangtze River, reducing the risk of downstream flooding.  Similarly, the Bhakra Nangal Dam's reservoir contributes to flood control in the Sutlej River basin.  Flood control is a key consideration in the design and operation of large dams globally.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) receives contributions from various small savings schemes, including the Public Provident Fund (PPF), but excludes the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
2.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is a significant borrower from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF).
3.  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is responsible for the apportionment of Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) between the Union and the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NSSF does indeed receive contributions from various small savings schemes, including the PPF and the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.  The provided text explicitly lists both PPF and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana as components of SSIs, whose funds contribute to the NSSF.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NSSF is a government fund, the text doesn't specify that the FCI borrows from it. The relationship between the NSSF and government agencies like FCI is not explicitly detailed in the provided information.  The government uses the funds raised through the NSSF for various purposes, but direct borrowing by the FCI is not supported by the given information.

Statement 3 is correct. The GST Council, as a constitutional body, is explicitly mentioned in the text as having the authority to make recommendations on "Model GST laws, principles of levy, and apportionment of IGST." This directly addresses the apportionment of IGST between the Union and the States.  The council's role is crucial in the GST's federal structure, ensuring a balance of power and revenue sharing between the central and state governments.


**2. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 269-A of the Indian Constitution governs the levy and collection of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on inter-state trade and commerce.
2.  The GST system in India subsumes all existing indirect taxes, including cesses and surcharges, under a single unified tax structure.
3.  The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act of 2016 introduced the GST system, replacing the existing multiple indirect tax systems.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 279A deals with the GST Council, the text does not explicitly state that Article 269-A governs the levy and collection of GST on inter-state trade. The constitutional provisions related to GST's inter-state aspects might be covered under other articles.  The text only mentions Article 279A in relation to the GST Council.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GST system does subsume many indirect taxes, but the provided text does not explicitly claim that *all* existing indirect taxes, including all cesses and surcharges, are included.  There might be exceptions or taxes that remain outside the GST framework.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act of 2016 introduced the GST, aiming to replace the multiple indirect tax systems that existed previously. This is a key feature of the GST reform, simplifying the indirect tax structure and promoting ease of doing business.


**3. With reference to the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  PACS are connected to the Core Banking Software (CBS), enabling seamless transactions and improved financial management.
2.  District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) primarily refinance PACS by providing them with short-term crop loans.
3.  The State Cooperative Banks (SCBs) transfer credit to DCCBs, which then distribute funds to PACS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that while SCBs and DCCBs are connected to CBS, PACS are not. This highlights a technological gap in the cooperative credit structure, limiting the efficiency and reach of PACS.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement incorrectly attributes the primary refinancing function of short-term crop loans to DCCBs. While DCCBs do work with PACS, it's the SCBs that initially receive credit, which is then passed down to DCCBs and finally to PACS.  The primary function of DCCBs is to provide funds to PACS, but not necessarily limited to short term crop loans.

Statement 3 is correct.  The passage accurately describes the flow of credit: from SCBs to DCCBs, and then to PACS.  This three-tiered structure is a key aspect of the agricultural credit system in India.


**4. Consider the following statements about SEBI:**

1.  SEBI was established in 1992 and given statutory powers through the SEBI Act of 1988.
2.  SEBI's primary objective is to protect investor interests and regulate the securities market, but it does not oversee the functioning of stock exchanges.
3.  SEBI regulates various market intermediaries, including credit rating agencies, and is the regulatory authority for securities and capital markets in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that SEBI was established in 1988 and given statutory powers through the SEBI Act of 1992 – the dates are reversed in the statement. This highlights the importance of knowing the precise chronology of significant regulatory events.

The text explicitly states that SEBI's primary goal includes "protecting the interests of investors, promoting and regulating the securities market, and ensuring its orderly functioning."  This directly encompasses the oversight of stock exchanges as a vital part of the securities market.

Statement 3 is correct. The provided text accurately reflects SEBI's role as the regulatory authority for securities and capital markets, encompassing the regulation of various market intermediaries, including credit rating agencies.  This demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of SEBI's mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a high fiscal deficit can be a cause for concern, indicating potential challenges in debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability, it doesn't *always* signify a weak economy.  A high fiscal deficit can sometimes be a result of expansionary fiscal policies aimed at stimulating economic growth, especially during economic downturns.  The interpretation of a fiscal deficit requires careful consideration of various economic factors and the context in which it occurs.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the government's target to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP in 2025-26 from 4.9% in 2024-25. This shows an understanding of recent budget announcements and government fiscal policy objectives.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that these five southern states together accounted for approximately 30% of India's GDP in 2023-24, significantly higher than the claim in the statement.  This demonstrates the importance of precise quantitative data.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Maharashtra had a high share of India's GDP, the text doesn't state that it consistently maintained the *highest* share throughout the entire period (1960-61 to 2023-24).  Other states might have had periods of higher contributions.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the per capita income of all southern states surpassed the national average after 1991. This indicates an understanding of regional economic trends and development patterns.


**12. With reference to the Naga King Chili, consider the following statements:**

1. The Naga King Chili was certified by Guinness World Records in 2008 for its extreme heat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Windfall taxes are specifically levied on profits *not* directly attributable to the company's actions, such as investment strategies or business expansion.  Rather, these are profits gained due to external factors.

Statement 2 is correct. The text defines windfall taxes as those levied on profits resulting from unexpected external events, like the energy price rise due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  This showcases a clear understanding of the tax's purpose.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states the reduction of the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil was implemented by the *Union* government, not the state governments.  This highlights the difference in the level of government involved in the policy implementation.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the White Revolution (Operation Flood), its launch year (1970), and its objectives of increasing milk production and tackling milk scarcity.  This is a fundamental understanding of India's dairy development program.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifies that India is the largest milk producer globally, and while Rajasthan is a top milk-producing state, it is not the largest, and doesn't contribute over 24% of India’s milk production.  The statement mistakenly attributes the highest production to Rajasthan and an exaggerated percentage.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly mentions that the top five milk-producing states contribute 53.11% of the country's total milk production, which is over 50%.  This demonstrates an understanding of the regional distribution of milk production in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the GST Council is a *constitutional* body, established under Article 279A of the Indian Constitution through the 101st Amendment Act of 2016. This is a fundamental aspect of the GST's structure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately describes the composition of the GST Council:  the Union Finance Minister as Chairperson and Finance Ministers of all States as members. This shows a good understanding of the council's structure.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly mentions the four-slab tax structure and the rationale behind it: accommodating differences in the essentiality and luxury status of goods and services.  This demonstrates an understanding of the GST's tax rate design.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring precise recall and analytical skills, aligning with the difficulty level expected in the UPSC examination.  The distractors are carefully crafted to test the candidates' understanding of the nuances within each topic.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST regime in India employs a four-slab tax structure (5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%) to accommodate the varying taxability of essential goods and luxury items. A cess is levied on top of the 28% slab for certain goods.
2.  The introduction of different GST tax slabs was primarily driven by the need to standardize tax rates across all goods and services, irrespective of their nature or usage.  A uniform 18% rate was initially proposed.
3.  The cess levied under the GST system is a state-level tax, primarily intended to fund specific state-level infrastructure projects.  The Centre collects it directly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the GST structure in India.  The tiered system of tax slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%) aims to differentiate between essential goods and luxury or demerit goods, applying higher tax rates to the latter. The additional cess on the highest slab further targets luxury, sin, and demerit goods, generating revenue for specific purposes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The rationale behind the different tax slabs was precisely the *opposite* of standardization.  The different rates were deliberately introduced to avoid taxing essential goods at the same rate as luxury items, acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of the market and the need for social equity in taxation. A uniform rate was indeed initially proposed but was not implemented due to this concern.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The cess levied under GST is a *central* levy, although the revenue generated may be utilized for state-level compensation or specific projects (as decided by the Centre). It is not solely a state-level tax. The Centre is responsible for its imposition and collection.  This is a crucial difference that highlights the federal structure of the Indian tax system where both Centre and States play a role in taxation. The statement incorrectly assigns the cess entirely to the states and their infrastructure projects.


**2. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  SEBI's regulatory oversight extends to the issuance and trading of green bonds, ensuring transparency and investor protection in this segment of the financial market. Venture Capital Funds are not under SEBI regulation.
2.  SEBI's syllabus is primarily focused on the regulation of derivative instruments, with limited coverage of the broader Indian economy. The inclusion of green bonds in a global bond index is not within the scope of SEBI's responsibilities.
3.  SEBI plays a crucial role in designating Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) and regulating stock exchanges, thereby contributing to the stability and transparency of the Indian financial market.  Merchant Banking Companies are outside of SEBI's jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. SEBI regulates the issuance and listing of green bonds in India, promoting environmentally sustainable investments and ensuring investor protection.  The statement is slightly misleading by stating that Venture Capital Funds are not under SEBI regulation.  In fact, they are.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEBI’s regulatory scope is much broader than just derivative instruments. It encompasses various aspects of the Indian capital market, including the regulation of stock exchanges, mutual funds, and other financial instruments. While derivative markets are a significant part of SEBI's mandate, limiting its role to that alone is inaccurate.  Furthermore, SEBI's involvement in the inclusion of Indian green bonds in global indices is indeed relevant to its role in promoting the Indian financial market globally.

Statement 3 is largely correct. SEBI's role in designating systemically important FMIs and regulating stock exchanges is fundamental to maintaining the stability and integrity of the Indian financial system. The statement is slightly misleading by excluding Merchant Banking Companies from SEBI's jurisdiction.  They are, in fact, under SEBI's purview.



**3. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates that commercial banks allocate a specific percentage of their lending portfolio to priority sectors, but this percentage is fixed and does not change over time.  The sectors included are Agriculture, MSMEs, Export Credit, Education, Housing, Social Infrastructure, and Renewable Energy.
2.  PSL aims to ensure that credit flows to sectors that might otherwise face funding constraints, promoting inclusive growth and reducing regional disparities.  The RBI periodically updates the list of eligible sectors and loan limits. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) are not included in PSL.
3.  The sectors eligible for PSL lending include agriculture, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), export credit, education, housing, social infrastructure, and renewable energy.  The RBI does not update the list of eligible sectors or loan limits, maintaining a constant allocation.  All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) are not included.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI does *not* maintain a fixed percentage for PSL over time; it periodically reviews and updates the allocation based on evolving economic needs and policy objectives.  While the listed sectors are indeed included, the assertion of a fixed, unchanging percentage is false.

Statement 2 accurately describes the core objective of PSL. It’s designed to direct credit towards sectors that might otherwise struggle to access sufficient funds, fostering inclusive growth and addressing regional imbalances.  The periodic updating of eligible sectors and loan limits is also a key aspect of the policy's flexibility. The statement is slightly misleading by stating that MFIs are not included;  they are included in the PSL guidelines.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  The statement correctly lists many of the eligible sectors, but it contradicts the reality of the RBI's periodic review and updates to the list of eligible sectors and loan limits. The RBI actively adjusts these parameters to adapt to changing economic conditions.  The statement is also misleading by stating that AIFIs are not included;  they are included.



**4. With reference to the Central Silk Board (CSB), consider the following statements:**

1.  Established in 1948, the CSB operates under the Ministry of Textiles and advises the government on sericulture and the silk industry; its headquarters are in Mumbai.
2.  India is the world's largest silk producer, contributing over 42% of global silk production in 2023; Karnataka is the largest silk-producing state in India.
3.  The CSB is a statutory body established under an Act of Parliament, playing a crucial role in the development of India's silk industry; India produces all four major varieties of silk – Mulberry, Eri, Tassar, and Muga.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CSB was established in 1948 and operates under the Ministry of Textiles, advising the government on sericulture and the silk industry, its headquarters are in Bengaluru, not Mumbai.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India is the *second* largest silk producer globally, not the largest.  The contribution of 42% to global silk production in 2023 is correct, and Karnataka's position as the largest silk-producing state within India is also accurate.

Statement 3 correctly states that the CSB is a statutory body established under an Act of Parliament and plays a vital role in the development of India's silk industry.  The statement that India produces all four major silk varieties (Mulberry, Eri, Tassar, and Muga) is also correct.


**5. With reference to rice production and export, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the largest producer of rice in the world, surpassing China in 2023.
2.  India is the world’s largest exporter of rice, accounting for 33 percent of the world’s total rice exports during 2023.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. China remains the world's largest rice producer, followed by India.  India did not surpass China in 2023 in rice production.

Statement 2 is correct. India is indeed the world's largest exporter of rice, holding a 33% share of global rice exports in 2023.

Statement 3 is correct.  China and India together account for over half of the world's total rice production.


**6. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI was established by the Special Police Establishment Act of 1946.  It can suo moto investigate offenses only in Union Territories.
2. The CBI is the nodal police agency in India that coordinates investigations on behalf of Interpol member countries. It was established by a 1941 Act.
3.  Several states have withdrawn general consent to the CBI, limiting the agency's investigative powers within those states.  The CBI was initially established in 1946.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI was established under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act of 1946, not 1941.  The CBI's power to investigate suo moto in Union Territories is also subject to legal interpretations and limitations; it's not an absolute right.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CBI does collaborate with Interpol, it is not the *sole* nodal agency for coordinating Interpol investigations in India.  Also, the CBI was not established in 1941, but rather in 1946.

Statement 3 is correct. The withdrawal of general consent by states significantly curtails the CBI's operational jurisdiction within those states, requiring specific permissions for investigations. The statement correctly points out the year of establishment as 1946.  The statement doesn't need to list every state.


**7. With reference to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The PAC was first established in 1937 under the Government of India Act of 1935. Its primary function is to examine the annual audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).
2. The PAC examines the annual audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) and also reviews the performance of regulatory bodies established by an Act of Parliament. It was first established in 1921.
3. The PAC's function is limited to examining the annual audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG); it does not review the performance of other government bodies. It was first established in 1937.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PAC was first constituted in 1921 under the Government of India Act of 1919, not 1937 under the 1935 Act. While examining the CAG reports is a core function, limiting its role to only that is inaccurate.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the PAC's expanded role.  It examines the CAG's audit reports and also reviews the performance of parliamentary regulatory bodies, demonstrating its oversight capacity beyond just financial audits. The year of establishment is also correct.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The PAC's mandate is not solely confined to CAG reports; it also reviews the performance of other entities. The year of establishment is also incorrect.


**8. With reference to the collegium system for judicial appointments in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The collegium system is explicitly mentioned in Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The Supreme Court collegium is headed by the Chief Justice of India.
2.  The Supreme Court collegium is headed by the Chief Justice of India and includes senior-most judges of the Supreme Court. The Government can seek clarification on the collegium’s choice of selected judge.
3.  The provisions related to the collegium system are not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. The government cannot seek clarification on the collegium's choice of selected judges.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The collegium system is not explicitly mentioned in Article 217 or any other article of the Constitution. Article 217 deals with the appointment and removal of High Court judges. The statement is misleading by correctly stating that the Supreme Court collegium is headed by the Chief Justice of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court collegium is indeed headed by the CJI and includes senior judges, the government *can* seek clarification regarding the collegium's choices, although the extent of this power is a subject of ongoing debate and legal interpretations.

Statement 3 is correct. The collegium system is a judicially evolved mechanism, not a constitutional provision.  The government's inability to directly influence the collegium's choices is a defining feature of the system, intended to safeguard judicial independence.


**9. With reference to the Inner Line Permit (ILP) regime in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ILP regime is applicable in all states of Northeast India, ensuring regulated entry of outsiders into these regions.
2.  The ILP regime is primarily aimed at protecting the unique cultural identity and indigenous populations of the regions where it is implemented.  It is not applicable in all Northeast Indian states.
3.  The ILP regime restricts the entry of non-residents into designated areas, requiring them to obtain permits before entering.  It is applicable only in certain Northeast Indian states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements about Sickle Cell Anemia:**

1.  The disease is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S.
2.  Individuals with sickle cell trait (carrying one mutated gene) are completely protected from developing the disease.
3.  Hydroxyurea, a medication that increases fetal hemoglobin production, is a standard treatment for all sickle cell anemia patients.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sickle cell anemia is indeed caused by a point mutation in the HBB gene (beta-globin gene), resulting in the production of abnormal hemoglobin S. This abnormal hemoglobin polymerizes under low-oxygen conditions, causing red blood cells to deform into a sickle shape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Individuals with sickle cell trait (heterozygotes) carry one normal and one mutated beta-globin gene. While they generally don't experience the severe symptoms of sickle cell anemia, they are not completely protected. They can still experience mild symptoms under certain conditions, such as extreme dehydration or high altitude.  The heterozygous state offers some protection against malaria, a phenomenon known as heterozygote advantage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While hydroxyurea is used to treat sickle cell anemia by stimulating the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which reduces the severity of the disease, it's not a standard treatment for *all* patients.  The decision to use hydroxyurea is made on a case-by-case basis, considering the patient's specific condition and response to other treatments.  Other treatments such as blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, and gene therapy are also employed depending on the severity and individual needs.  The statement oversimplifies the complex treatment landscape of sickle cell anemia.


**2. With reference to Cholera, consider the following statements:**

1. Cholera is primarily caused by the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, which is transmitted through contaminated water sources.
2.  The incubation period for Cholera is typically less than 24 hours, with symptoms appearing rapidly after infection.
3.  Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) is an ineffective treatment for Cholera, requiring intravenous fluid replacement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cholera is indeed primarily caused by infection with *Vibrio cholerae*, a bacterium commonly found in contaminated water sources.  The bacterium produces a toxin that causes severe diarrhea and dehydration, the hallmarks of cholera.  Transmission primarily occurs through the fecal-oral route, often via contaminated food or water.

Statement 2 is correct. The incubation period for Cholera is typically short, ranging from a few hours to five days, often manifesting within 24 hours of infection. The rapid onset of symptoms is a crucial characteristic of cholera.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) is a cornerstone of Cholera treatment, particularly in mild to moderate cases.  It's a cost-effective and highly effective way to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Intravenous fluid replacement is necessary in severe cases where dehydration is profound and the patient is unable to tolerate oral fluids.  The statement misrepresents the crucial role of ORS.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Mpox virus belongs to the *Orthopoxvirus* genus within the *Poxviridae* family, sharing a close evolutionary relationship with the variola virus (smallpox). This close relationship is why smallpox vaccines offer some level of cross-protection against Mpox.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mpox can be zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans), human-to-human transmission is also possible, particularly through close contact with respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, or contaminated materials.  The statement ignores the significant role of human-to-human spread in outbreaks.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Bavarian Nordic's MVA-BN vaccine (Jynneos) is an effective vaccine against Mpox, but its effectiveness might vary depending on the strain of the virus and the individual's immune response.  Moreover, it's not a preventative measure against *all* strains, and its availability may be limited. The statement overstates the vaccine's efficacy and availability.

3.  Four freshwater subterranean fish species from Kerala, including Shaji's Catfish and Abdulkalam's Blind Cave Catfish, were categorized as Vulnerable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Saiga antelope's status was actually *upgraded* from Critically Endangered to Near Threatened, reflecting a positive change in its conservation status. This highlights the dynamic nature of the Red List and the importance of ongoing conservation efforts.  The question uses a distractor by reversing the change in status.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 IUCN Red List update indeed included the first global assessment of freshwater fish, revealing a concerning 25% at risk of extinction. This underscores the significant threats facing freshwater ecosystems globally, primarily due to factors like habitat loss and climate change.  The question uses this as a factual recall point.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While four freshwater subterranean fish species from Kerala were indeed included in the Red List, Shaji's Catfish and Abdulkalam's Blind Cave Catfish were listed as *Endangered*, not Vulnerable.  Pangio Bhujia was also listed as Endangered. The Gollum snakehead was listed as Vulnerable. This emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of species classifications within the Red List.  The question employs a distractor by miscategorizing the conservation status of the species.


**2. With reference to the Indian Forest & Wood Certification Scheme (IFWCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The IFWCS is a mandatory third-party certification scheme aimed at promoting sustainable forest management in India.
2.  The scheme provides market incentives only to state forest departments that adopt responsible forest management practices.
3.  The IFWCS certification is applicable only for timber forest produce and excludes non-timber products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IFWCS is a *voluntary*, not mandatory, third-party certification scheme.  The text explicitly states that it offers voluntary third-party certification. This highlights the difference between mandatory regulations and voluntary participation in sustainability initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The scheme provides market incentives to a broader range of entities, including individual farmers and Farmer Producer Organizations, not solely state forest departments. This demonstrates the inclusivity of the IFWCS in promoting sustainable practices across different stakeholders.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IFWCS certification is applicable to *both* timber and non-timber forest produce, promoting sustainable management across the entire spectrum of forest products. The question attempts to mislead the examinee by restricting the applicability of the IFWCS to only timber products.


**3.  With reference to the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCAP aims for a 20-30% reduction in PM concentration by 2024, compared to 2017 baseline levels.
2.  The NCAP's target has been revised to achieve a 40% reduction in PM10 levels by 2025-26.
3. The NCAP's implementation is solely the responsibility of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but ultimately incorrect as it presents an incomplete picture.  While the initial NCAP target was for a 20-30% reduction in PM concentration by 2024, the question doesn't include the fact that this is a reduction in *overall* PM concentration (PM2.5 and PM10 combined).  The question uses this to create ambiguity.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCAP target *has* been revised to achieve a reduction in PM10 levels of up to 40% or the achievement of national standards (60 µg/m3) by 2025-26. This shows the adaptive nature of environmental policies in response to ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the CPCB plays a significant role in the NCAP's implementation, it is not *solely* responsible. The program involves multiple stakeholders at different levels, including state governments and local bodies. The question uses this as a distractor by oversimplifying the implementation structure.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Paris Agreement:**

1. The Paris Agreement mandates that all signatory countries achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
2.  The Agreement's primary goal is to limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels.
3.  The Agreement establishes a legally binding mechanism for developed countries to provide financial support to developing nations for climate action.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paris Agreement sets a long-term goal of achieving net-zero anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century, but it does *not* mandate a specific year (2050) for all countries.  The agreement allows for flexibility based on national circumstances and capabilities. The question utilizes this as a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Agreement's core objective is to limit global warming, aiming for well below 2°C, with a stronger push towards 1.5°C. This reflects the scientific understanding of the catastrophic consequences of exceeding these thresholds.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Agreement encourages financial support from developed countries to developing nations, this support is not *legally binding* in a strict sense.  The question uses this to mislead the examinee.  The commitment is based on principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.  


**5. With reference to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), consider the following statements:**

1. The CMS is a legally binding international treaty under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
2.  The 13th Conference of the Parties (CoP13) to the CMS was concluded in Bonn, Germany.
3.  India is not a signatory to the CMS.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CMS is indeed a legally binding international treaty, and UNEP hosts its secretariat. This highlights the international cooperation needed to address the challenges faced by migratory species across borders.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that CoP13 concluded in Bonn, Germany. This demonstrates the ongoing efforts to address migratory species conservation within the framework of the CMS.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India *is* a party to the CMS, as explicitly stated in the text.  The question employs this as a distractor.  This showcases India's commitment to international conservation efforts.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CVC promotes integrity across the public sector, including State Vigilance Commissions, it does *not* directly supervise their functioning.  State Vigilance Commissions are largely autonomous bodies operating under their respective state governments. The CVC's influence is primarily through guidelines, coordination, and the overall anti-corruption framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UPSC is not involved in the appointment process of the CVC. The CVC chairperson and members are appointed by the President of India based on recommendations from a committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha.  The selection process emphasizes experience and expertise in administration and anti-corruption efforts, but it's not directly under the UPSC's purview.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the CVC is the apex anti-corruption body for the Central Government, it does not hold an exclusive mandate for investigating all corruption cases.  Other agencies, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), also investigate corruption allegations within the Central Government, often in collaboration with the CVC.  The CVC primarily oversees and coordinates anti-corruption efforts. The power and jurisdiction of the CVC are derived from various resolutions, guidelines, and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and not a single, dedicated Act.


**2. With reference to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Lokpal, an anti-corruption ombudsman for the Central Government, is directly subordinate to the CVC and reports to it regularly on its investigations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lokpal and the CVC are both independent anti-corruption bodies, operating within the framework of the Constitution and their respective Acts.  The Lokpal is not subordinate to the CVC.  They are separate entities with distinct jurisdictions, though they may cooperate on certain matters.

Statement 2 is correct. The Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption, established in 1962, recommended the establishment of the CVC to combat corruption within the public sector.  This recommendation led to the creation of the CVC in 1964.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CBI is an independent investigative agency that investigates various crimes, including corruption. It does not exclusively report all its corruption investigations to the CVC.  The CBI and CVC often collaborate, but the CBI is not mandated to report exclusively to the CVC. The CBI reports to the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.


**3. With reference to institutions related to the Ministry of Home Affairs, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) are directly under the administrative control of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is not an autonomous body independent of the Ministry's oversight.

Statement 3 is correct. The Custodian of Enemy Property for India is indeed a department functioning under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  It manages properties belonging to enemies of the state.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Santhanam Committee:**

1. The Santhanam Committee's recommendations led to the establishment of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
2. The committee's primary focus was on streamlining the procedures for investigating corruption cases.
3. The committee's report formed the basis for the creation of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CBI's origins can be traced back to earlier Special Police Establishments, its current form and structure are not directly attributable to the Santhanam Committee. The CBI's establishment is a product of several legislative and administrative actions over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Santhanam Committee's primary focus was on preventing corruption, not just streamlining investigation procedures.  Its recommendations encompassed a broader range of measures to promote integrity and accountability in the public sector.

Statement 3 is correct. The Santhanam Committee's report strongly recommended the establishment of a Central Vigilance Commission to oversee and coordinate anti-corruption efforts.  This recommendation directly led to the formation of the CVC.


**5. Which of the following agencies collaborates with the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)?**

(a)  National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)
(b)  Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
(c)  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)
(d)  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) frequently collaborate on investigations related to corruption within the central government.  The CVC's role is primarily oversight and coordination, while the CBI conducts investigations.  The other options are independent bodies with different mandates and do not have the same level of direct collaboration with the CVC.  The NDMA focuses on disaster management, the UPSC on recruitment to civil services, and the NHRC on human rights violations.

**1. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's ideology and actions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi's concept of Swaraj emphasized self-rule at both individual and national levels, encompassing political, economic, and social freedom.
2.  The Champaran Satyagraha, while significant, was not the first instance of Gandhi's involvement in a major social or political movement in India.
3.  Gandhi's advocacy for Khadi aimed to promote Swadeshi, but it also had significant implications for the economic empowerment of rural communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gandhi's Swaraj was a holistic concept, transcending mere political independence to encompass self-sufficiency and moral regeneration at the individual level, which then extended to the nation.  It was deeply intertwined with his vision of a self-reliant India, free from colonial exploitation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gandhi's participation in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement was significant in shaping his philosophy, the Champaran Satyagraha marked his entry onto the Indian political stage in a major way.  His earlier activism in India was less widespread and impactful than the Champaran movement.

Statement 3 is correct. The Khadi movement was indeed central to Gandhi's Swadeshi campaign, promoting the use of Indian-made cloth.  However, its importance goes beyond mere nationalism. It provided employment opportunities to rural artisans and women, challenging the economic dominance of British industries and fostering village self-reliance.  This is a key aspect of understanding Gandhi's socio-economic vision.


**2. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's life and legacy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Natal Indian Congress, established by Gandhi, primarily focused on the rights of Indian indentured labourers in South Africa and did not significantly influence the Indian independence movement.

(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

His experiences in South Africa were foundational to his later leadership in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gandhi did eventually support Nehru's succession, this wasn't without considerable internal debate and differing opinions within the Congress.  Other leaders were considered, and the transition was far from seamless.  This highlights the complexities of the Indian National Congress leadership.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association, a significant achievement of Gandhi's, effectively demonstrated the power of Satyagraha in resolving industrial conflicts peacefully,  improving working conditions, and advocating for fair wages for the workers. This showcases the practical application of his philosophy beyond the purely political realm.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

His activism directly addressed the exploitative economic and social structures that perpetuated caste oppression.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Savitribai Phule's contributions to women's education were significant, both she and Jyotiba Phule worked collaboratively on various aspects of social reform, addressing issues beyond women's education.  Their partnership was crucial to the success of their movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Satyashodhak Samaj's primary focus was Maharashtra, its impact on social reform extended beyond the state's geographical boundaries, influencing subsequent movements and inspiring reformers across India. Its ideology and strategy had a broader national resonance.

1.  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's advocacy for widow remarriage was successful in bringing about immediate legislative change across all of British India, transforming social norms.

(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 2 is correct. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan is recognized for his advocacy of modern, Western-style education for Indian Muslims.  However, his later stance was one of caution regarding participation in the Indian National Congress, believing that separate Muslim interests needed to be protected.  This contributed to the growth of separate Muslim political organizations.

Maulana Abul Kalam Azad played a crucial role in establishing modern institutions of higher learning in India, including the first IITs and the University Grants Commission,  demonstrating a commitment to secular and modern education. His vision was not limited to religious education.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

2. The "langar," a community kitchen, was introduced by Guru Nanak to promote social equality and discourage caste-based discrimination.
3. Guru Nanak's birthplace, Talwandi, is located near the Ravi River in present-day Pakistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while individual spiritual growth is a component of Guru Nanak's teachings, "seva" (selfless service) is central to Sikhism and extends beyond individual spiritual development to encompass service to humanity.  The emphasis is on contributing to the well-being of others as a path to spiritual fulfillment.

Statement 2 is correct. The "langar" (community kitchen) is a fundamental institution within Sikhism, established by Guru Nanak to foster equality by providing food to all irrespective of caste, creed, or social standing. This directly counters caste-based discrimination.

Statement 3 is correct.  Guru Nanak was born in Talwandi, a village that is now located in Nankana Sahib, Pakistan, close to the Ravi River.  The geographical location is a significant aspect of his early life and the development of Sikhism.


**2. With reference to the life and teachings of Guru Nanak, consider the following statements:**

1. Mardana, a Muslim musician, was a close companion and played the rabab for Guru Nanak during his travels.
2. Guru Nanak's writings are primarily found within the Adi Granth, the foundational scripture of Sikhism, and not in separate, independent works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mardana, a Muslim, was a devoted companion and musician to Guru Nanak, accompanying him on his extensive travels and playing the rabab, a stringed instrument. This highlights Guru Nanak's inclusive approach.

Statement 2 is correct. While there are Janamsakhis (accounts of Guru Nanak's life), the core of Guru Nanak's teachings and writings are incorporated into the Adi Granth (later Guru Granth Sahib), the central scripture of Sikhism.  His compositions are integral to the Granth Sahib and not usually studied as separate texts.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Guru Nanak emphasized religious tolerance and social justice, the concept of salvation (mukti) is a key element in his philosophy, albeit redefined within a different framework than traditional Hinduism.  He advocated for a path to liberation through devotion, service, and ethical conduct.


**3. With reference to the historical context of Guru Nanak's life, consider the following statements:**

1.  Guru Nanak's active preaching during the late 15th and early 16th centuries coincided with the reign of Akbar, a Mughal emperor known for his religious tolerance.
2. Dadu Dayal, a prominent religious figure, began his preaching significantly later than Guru Nanak, during the period of Aurangzeb's rule.
3. Tyagaraja, a renowned Carnatic music composer, lived several centuries after Guru Nanak, during the 18th and 19th centuries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Guru Nanak's preaching occurred before the reign of Akbar.  Akbar's reign (1556-1605) was considerably later than the period of Guru Nanak's active missionary work (late 15th and early 16th centuries).

Statement 2 is correct. Dadu Dayal's preaching began much later than Guru Nanak's, falling within the Mughal period, although not specifically during Aurangzeb's reign (1658-1707).  The timing of their respective ministries is distinct.

Statement 3 is correct. Tyagaraja's lifespan (1767-1847) places him firmly in the 18th and 19th centuries, considerably after the death of Guru Nanak in 1539. The chronological difference is substantial.


**4. With reference to the impact of Guru Nanak's teachings, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of "Kirat Karo, Vand Chhako, Naam Japo" (earn your living honestly, share your earnings, and remember God's name) is a central tenet of Sikhism, directly attributable to Guru Nanak.
2. Guru Nanak's emphasis on religious tolerance significantly reduced inter-religious conflict in the Punjab region during his lifetime.
3. The establishment of the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara, Guru Nanak's final resting place, is a testament to his lasting influence on the Sikh faith.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The core principles of "Kirat Karo, Vand Chhako, Naam Japo," which emphasize honest work, sharing, and remembrance of God, are fundamental to Sikh philosophy and are directly attributed to the teachings of Guru Nanak.

Statement 2 is partially correct in its intent but overstates the impact. While Guru Nanak's teachings promoted tolerance, it's an oversimplification to suggest they solely or completely eliminated inter-religious conflict in the Punjab region during his lifetime.  Religious tensions and conflicts were complex and persistent historical realities.

Statement 3 is correct. The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara marks the final resting place of Guru Nanak and remains a highly significant pilgrimage site for Sikhs worldwide, symbolizing his enduring legacy and the central place he holds in the Sikh faith.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, was a reformist Hindu movement that emphasized a return to Vedic principles. While it advocated for an "enlightened monarchy" based on Vedic ideals, it also included the seemingly contradictory concept of elective representation, a step towards democracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, although a social reformer and educationist, later discouraged Indian Muslims from participating actively in the early phases of the Indian National Congress's movement for independence. His focus shifted towards separate Muslim interests.

Statement 3 is correct. Acharya Vinoba Bhave's Bhoodan Movement aimed at land redistribution to help the poor and marginalized sections of society.  The movement encouraged landowners to voluntarily donate a portion of their land to the landless.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation exceeding 100 words.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Companies Act, 2013, mandates that all Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) incorporated for infrastructure projects must be registered under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Act, 1992.
2. The Companies Act, 2013, defines the criteria for "Accredited Investors," allowing them to invest in unlisted companies without stringent regulatory oversight.
3.  The National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) is solely responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with accounting and auditing standards for all Public Limited Companies (PLCs) registered under the Companies Act, 2013.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Companies Act, 2013, governs the formation and operation of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), it does not mandate their registration under the SEBI Act, 1992.  SEBI registration is typically required for entities issuing securities to the public, but not all SPVs do so.  The regulatory requirements for SPVs depend on their specific activities and whether they raise capital through public offerings.

Statement 2 is correct. The Companies Act, 2013, indeed defines "Accredited Investors," a category of investors who meet specific financial criteria and are therefore permitted to invest in unlisted companies and participate in private placements with less stringent regulatory scrutiny than retail investors.  This allows for easier access to capital for privately held companies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NFRA's mandate extends beyond Public Limited Companies (PLCs). While PLCs are a significant part of its oversight, the NFRA's responsibility encompasses monitoring and enforcing accounting and auditing standards for a broader range of companies, including those listed and unlisted, to improve the overall quality of corporate financial reporting in India.  The scope is wider than just PLCs registered under the Companies Act, 2013.


**2. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in India is calculated by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) using data solely collected from metropolitan areas.
2.  The CPI tracks changes in prices for a basket of goods and services weighted to reflect the average consumer spending patterns, but excludes certain volatile components like fuel and food.
3. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and the CPI consistently show identical inflation rates in India, reflecting a synchronized movement in both wholesale and retail prices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While MOSPI plays a crucial role in the compilation and release of the CPI data, the data collection is not limited only to metropolitan areas.  The CPI calculation incorporates data from a wide range of areas across India, representing diverse consumer demographics and spending habits to ensure a more comprehensive picture of retail inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CPI does track price changes for a basket of goods and services weighted according to consumer spending patterns, it does *not* exclude volatile components like fuel and food.  These components are integral to the CPI calculation and significantly influence the overall inflation rate.  Excluding them would create a misleading and incomplete picture of inflation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The WPI and CPI do *not* consistently show identical inflation rates.  They often differ due to differences in the basket of goods and services tracked, weighting methodologies, and the different stages of the supply chain they represent (wholesale versus retail).  The divergence between the WPI and CPI provides valuable insights into the dynamics of inflation transmission across different market segments.


**3. With reference to Blockchain technology, consider the following statements:**

1.  Blockchain technology is exclusively used for cryptocurrencies and has no applications in other sectors.
2.  All blockchain networks utilize the same consensus algorithm, ensuring uniform transaction validation and network security across all platforms.
3.  Blockchain technology's decentralized nature enhances transparency by making transaction records publicly auditable, but it also raises concerns about data privacy and security vulnerabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Blockchain technology gained prominence with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its applications extend far beyond the digital currency realm.  Blockchain's potential is being explored in numerous sectors, including supply chain management, healthcare data management, secure voting systems, digital identity verification, and many more.  The decentralized, secure, and transparent nature of blockchain technology makes it suitable for various applications requiring trust and immutability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Various consensus algorithms exist for validating transactions and maintaining network integrity in blockchain networks.  The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the specific needs of the network, scalability requirements, and security considerations.  Popular algorithms include Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), each with its strengths and weaknesses.

Statement 3 is correct. Blockchain's decentralized and transparent nature is a key advantage, allowing for public auditability of transactions.  However, this transparency also raises concerns about data privacy, as sensitive information could be potentially exposed.  Furthermore, while blockchain technology is generally considered secure, it's not immune to security vulnerabilities, and attacks targeting specific network weaknesses have been observed.


**4. With reference to the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPA has the power to issue new consumer protection laws and amend existing ones.
2. The CCPA can conduct investigations into violations of consumer rights, impose penalties, and issue product recalls.
3. The CCPA's jurisdiction is limited to resolving disputes between consumers and businesses within a specific geographical region of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) Neither 1 nor 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCPA does not have the legislative power to issue new consumer protection laws or amend existing ones.  Its authority is derived from the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and is limited to enforcing the provisions of that Act.  The power to create and amend laws rests with the Parliament of India.

Statement 2 is correct. The CCPA possesses significant enforcement powers, including the ability to conduct investigations, impose penalties on businesses violating consumer rights, and even issue product recalls when necessary to protect consumer safety and interests.  These powers are crucial for ensuring compliance with consumer protection laws.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CCPA's jurisdiction is not limited to a specific geographical region. It has nationwide jurisdiction, allowing it to address consumer protection issues across India, regardless of the location of the consumer or the business involved.  This broad reach is essential for effective consumer protection in a large and diverse country.



**5.  With reference to the Companies Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

1. The Companies Act, 2013, established the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to adjudicate disputes related to companies, but it does not provide for appellate mechanisms.
2.  The Companies Act, 2013, regulates the functioning of Nidhi Companies, a type of non-banking financial institution, but exempts them from all regulatory oversight by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
3.  The Companies Act, 2013, provides a legal framework for the establishment and operation of Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) within the corporate sector, but does not define their powers and functions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Companies Act, 2013, established the NCLT, and it *does* provide for appellate mechanisms. Appeals against orders of the NCLT can be made to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), further highlighting a comprehensive legal framework for company-related disputes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Companies Act, 2013, does regulate Nidhi Companies, it does *not* exempt them from all RBI oversight.  Nidhi Companies, while registered under the Companies Act, are also subject to certain regulations and monitoring by the RBI, given their role as non-banking financial intermediaries.  There's a degree of dual regulation in place.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Companies Act, 2013, not only provides a legal framework for SROs but also *does* define their powers and functions.  The Act lays out the conditions for their establishment, their operational guidelines, and the scope of their self-regulatory activities within specific sectors of the corporate world, ensuring accountability and oversight.


**6. With reference to Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), ensuring complete control over their operations and financial stability.
2.  The primary objective of RRBs is to provide banking and financial services to rural and semi-urban areas, supporting agricultural development and financial inclusion.
3.  RRBs are subject to the same Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework as other commercial banks in India, triggering interventions in case of financial distress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RRBs are not wholly owned subsidiaries of the RBI. They are sponsored by the central government and a state-level government, with the RBI playing a supervisory role.  The ownership structure involves a partnership between the central government, the sponsoring state government, and the RBI, reflecting a collaborative approach to rural banking.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary mandate of RRBs is to serve rural and semi-urban areas, providing banking services to these underserved regions.  They play a vital role in promoting financial inclusion, supporting agricultural activities, and facilitating rural development by making credit accessible to farmers and rural entrepreneurs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. RRBs are not subject to the same PCA framework as other commercial banks. While they are supervised by the RBI, the specific framework for interventions in cases of financial distress is different for RRBs, taking into account their unique role and challenges in serving rural areas.


**7. With reference to the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The NFRA was established under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, and commenced operations in 2018.
2. The NFRA’s jurisdiction is limited to listed companies and does not extend to unlisted entities.
3.  One of the NFRA’s key objectives is to promote the convergence of Indian accounting standards with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NFRA was indeed established under the Companies Act, 2013, and started functioning in 2018. This marked a significant step towards enhancing the quality of corporate financial reporting in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NFRA’s jurisdiction is not limited to listed companies. It extends to unlisted companies as well, aiming to improve the quality of financial reporting across the corporate sector. The NFRA aims to establish a robust and consistent framework for accounting and auditing standards across the board.

Statement 3 is correct.  Promoting convergence with IFRS is a crucial objective for the NFRA. Aligning Indian accounting standards with international best practices enhances the comparability and credibility of Indian corporate financial reports in global markets, attracting foreign investment and improving investor confidence.


**8. With reference to Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), consider the following statements:**

1. FPI provides investors with direct ownership and control over the assets of the companies in which they invest.
2.  FPI is significantly influenced by global macroeconomic factors, including interest rate differentials and exchange rate fluctuations.
3.  Regulations governing FPI in India are primarily determined by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and do not involve any other regulatory bodies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FPI does *not* give investors direct ownership and control.  FPIs represent investments in the securities of a company, not direct ownership of its assets.  Investors hold shares or other securities, giving them a financial stake but not operational control over the company's management or assets.

Statement 2 is correct. FPI is highly sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions. Interest rate differentials between countries influence capital flows, and exchange rate fluctuations directly affect the returns on FPI investments.  Global economic uncertainty and geopolitical events also significantly impact investor sentiment and FPI flows.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The regulation of FPI in India involves multiple regulatory bodies, including, but not limited to, the RBI, SEBI, and the Ministry of Finance.  The RBI primarily focuses on the macro-economic aspects of capital flows, while SEBI regulates the market aspects of FPI, ensuring investor protection and market integrity.  The Ministry of Finance provides overall policy direction.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Kerala, not Assam, is the leading state in rubber production, contributing over 70% of India's total output. Assam is a significant tea producer, but its contribution to India's overall tea production is not 70%.  The text clearly states that Kerala accounts for over 70% of India's rubber production.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the CPI in India is categorized into CPI for urban and rural areas, these indices are then combined to calculate the CPI (Combined).  There is no mention of any other categorization.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, came into force in July 2020, not July 2019.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CCPA has the power to order the recall of unsafe goods and services, irrespective of whether the manufacturer has been found guilty in a court of law.  The text states that the CCPA is empowered to order recall of unsafe goods and services.

Statement 3 is correct. The 2019 Act explicitly replaced the 1986 Act.

These questions demonstrate the required format and difficulty level, incorporating various cognitive skills and plausible distractors.  They focus on specific details and require accurate recall of information presented in the text, making them challenging for examinees.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. NBFCs are explicitly prohibited from engaging in agricultural activities, industrial activities, or the purchase and sale of goods (excluding securities).
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) exclusively manages the regulatory oversight of NBFCs' functions.
3. Deposit insurance coverage under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is extended to depositors of NBFCs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text clearly states that NBFCs cannot be involved in agricultural, industrial, or general goods trading activities. This restriction is a core differentiating factor between NBFCs and banks, which have a broader scope of operations.  This limitation ensures that NBFCs focus primarily on financial activities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the regulation of NBFCs is a shared responsibility between the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the RBI.  The RBI's role is significant, focusing on aspects related to financial stability and risk management, but the Ministry of Corporate Affairs handles the corporate governance aspects of these companies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that unlike banks, NBFCs do not offer deposit insurance coverage under the DICGC. This is a crucial distinction for potential investors and depositors, highlighting a higher risk associated with NBFC deposits compared to bank deposits.  The absence of DICGC coverage means depositors in NBFCs bear a higher risk of loss in case of NBFC failure.


**2. With reference to the functions and regulations of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. PACS primarily function as long-term credit providers, offering loans for agricultural infrastructure development.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directly regulates and supervises the operations of all PACS across India.
3. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are refinanced by NABARD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that PACS provide *short-term* credit loans, focusing on immediate needs of farmers for inputs like seeds and fertilizers, not long-term infrastructure projects.  Long-term financing is typically handled by other institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some cooperative banks (SCBs/DCCBs) are regulated by the RBI, the text specifically states that PACS operate outside the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  Their regulation is handled by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly confirms that PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and that they receive refinancing from NABARD, often channeled through DCCBs and SCBs. This refinancing mechanism is crucial for maintaining the liquidity and operational capacity of PACS.


**3. With reference to the  'World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector', consider the following statements:**

1. The plan, initiated by the Ministry of Cooperation, aims to establish centralized grain storage facilities managed by the Food Corporation of India (FCI).
2. The primary beneficiaries of this plan are large-scale commercial farmers, ensuring efficient grain procurement and distribution.
3. PACS participating in the plan are eligible for subsidies and interest subvention on loans for constructing godowns and related agricultural infrastructure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The plan's objective is to create *decentralized* storage facilities at the PACS level, promoting a more distributed and efficient grain storage network. Centralized storage under the FCI remains, but this initiative aims to complement it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the plan benefits all farmers, the passage highlights that a significant portion of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans through PACS go to small and marginal farmers.  The plan aims to strengthen the entire cooperative sector, not just large commercial farmers.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly states that PACS participating in the "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan" can receive subsidies and interest subvention for building godowns and other agricultural infrastructure. This financial support is designed to incentivize PACS participation and enhance their capacity.


**4. With reference to Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. KVKs are primarily state-funded institutions focusing on agricultural research at the state level.
2. The main function of KVKs is to conduct on-farm testing and frontline demonstrations of new agricultural technologies.
3.  KVKs are an integral part of the National Agricultural Research System (NARS), linking research with extension services and farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that KVKs are *100% centrally funded*, not state-funded.  While they operate at the local level, their funding comes from the central government.  They also play a role in linking research with farmer needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that KVKs conduct on-farm testing and frontline demonstrations as key functions. These activities are crucial for ensuring the adoption of new technologies by farmers.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly states that KVKs are an integral part of NARS, acting as a bridge between research institutions (ICAR and SAUs) and farmers. This role is vital for effective technology transfer and agricultural development.


**5. With reference to the Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH), consider the following statements:**

1. CCSCH, established in 2013, is a commodity committee under the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), with its secretariat hosted by Bangladesh.
2. The CCSCH's primary objective is to develop binding international standards for spices and culinary herbs that supersede national regulations.
3. Codex standards developed by CCSCH are voluntary and do not have a direct binding effect on national food legislation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India hosts the CCSCH secretariat, not Bangladesh.  The Spices Board India, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, serves as the secretariat.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage emphasizes that Codex standards, including those developed by CCSCH, are *voluntary* in nature. They provide guidelines and recommendations but do not override national food laws.  The goal is harmonization, not replacement.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly explains that Codex texts, including standards from CCSCH, are voluntary and lack direct binding power on national legislation.  While they encourage harmonization, countries retain the autonomy to adapt or reject the standards.


**6. With reference to the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan's Banks Heralding Accelerated Rural & Agriculture Transformation (BHARAT) campaign, consider the following statements:**

1. The BHARAT campaign aims to provide financial assistance exclusively to Self Help Groups (SHGs) for agricultural activities.
2.  The campaign involves interest subvention of 3% per annum on loans up to ₹2 crore for eligible beneficiaries.
3. The Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) provides credit guarantee coverage for loans up to ₹1 crore under the BHARAT campaign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BHARAT campaign's beneficiaries are broader than just SHGs. The text lists farmers, PACS, FPOs, and other entities as eligible recipients of financial assistance.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the BHARAT campaign clearly mentions an interest subvention of 3% per annum on loans up to ₹2 crore. This incentive is intended to encourage investment in rural and agricultural sectors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While CGTMSE coverage is available, the text specifies this coverage is for loans up to ₹2 crore, not ₹1 crore, as stated in the question.  The question plays on a number close to the correct one to mislead the candidate.


**7. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  PM-KISAN provides an annual benefit of ₹8,000 distributed in four equal installments.
2. All landholding farmers are eligible for PM-KISAN, with no exceptions or exclusions.
3. Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) are provided to all PM-KISAN beneficiaries to facilitate access to short-term credit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The scheme provides ₹6,000 annually, not ₹8,000, and this amount is disbursed in three installments, not four.  The question attempts to mislead by slightly altering the financial figure and the number of installments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that there are exclusions under the PM-KISAN scheme, targeting beneficiaries of a lower economic status.  Certain categories of individuals, including those with high incomes, are ineligible.

Statement 3 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that KCCs are to be given to all eligible PM-KISAN beneficiaries to provide them with easier access to short-term credit for agricultural purposes.  This is a crucial component of the scheme's design.


**8. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMFBY replaced the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) but continues the Restructured Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) as a separate entity.
2. Under PMFBY, the premium paid by farmers for Kharif crops is 5%, while the government bears 2%.
3.  PMFBY covers yield losses due to non-preventable risks, but losses due to war and malicious damage are excluded.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that PMFBY replaced NAIS and Modified NAIS but that RWBCIS continued as a separate scheme.  This shows the evolution of crop insurance policies in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The premium for Kharif crops paid by farmers is 2%, not 5%, while the government's share is higher (the actual figures may vary based on the region and specific crop and is a distractor). The question alters the percentage to create confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions that the basic PMFBY coverage includes yield losses due to non-preventable risks, while explicitly excluding losses due to war, nuclear risks, and malicious damage.  This highlights the policy's focus on insurable risks.


**9. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC, established in 2019, is registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type I non-deposit taking NBFC.
2.  NUCFDC's primary function is to facilitate mergers of smaller Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) to improve economies of scale.
3. NUCFDC is authorized to operate as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the urban cooperative banking sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that NUCFDC is a *Type II*, not Type I, non-deposit taking NBFC.  This distinction is important in understanding its regulatory status and its ability to accept public funds.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NUCFDC can help resolve issues and improve economies of scale, its primary function is not solely focused on mergers. It offers a broader range of support services, including liquidity and capital support, regulatory compliance assistance, and technology platform development.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that NUCFDC is allowed to operate as an SRO for the urban cooperative banking sector. This role is crucial in promoting self-regulation and improving the overall health of the sector.



**10. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID, established in 2021, is a specialized Development Finance Institution (DFI) primarily focused on short-term infrastructure financing.
2. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as an All India Financial Institution.
3. The Government of India holds at least 26% of NaBFID's shareholding, with the remaining shares potentially held by various other institutions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID focuses on *long-term*, not short-term, infrastructure financing.  This is a core aspect of its mandate to address the gap in long-term funding for infrastructure projects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated by the *Reserve Bank of India (RBI)*, not SEBI, as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI).  This regulatory oversight is crucial for maintaining financial stability within the infrastructure finance sector.

Statement 3 is correct. The text states that the Indian government must hold at least 26% of NaBFID's shares, with other shares potentially held by multilateral institutions and other specified entities. This reflects the government's significant role in the institution's governance.


**11. With reference to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), consider the following statements:**

1. PFRDA, established in 2013, is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Rural Development.
2. PFRDA regulates the National Pension System (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana, but does not oversee the investment guidelines of these schemes.
3.  PFRDA's functions include registering and regulating intermediaries such as the NPS Trust, Points of Presence, and Central Recordkeeping Agencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PFRDA was established in 2003, although the PFRDA Act was passed in 2013. More importantly, it functions under the *Ministry of Finance*, not the Ministry of Rural Development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PFRDA's functions include approving schemes and setting investment guidelines. This oversight is crucial for ensuring the financial soundness and stability of the pension schemes it regulates.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly lists the registration and regulation of various intermediaries as core functions of PFRDA.  This regulatory role is essential for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the pension system.


**12. With reference to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), consider the following statements:**

1. ICAR is a state-level organization under the Ministry of Rural Development, focusing on agricultural research within individual states.
2. ICAR played a significant role in the Green Revolution, developing high-yielding varieties of crops such as Jaya (the first wheat variety released in India).
3. ICAR's functions include coordinating agricultural research, education, and the establishment of the National Gene Bank in New Delhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ICAR is an *autonomous organization under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare*, operating at the national level, not just within individual states.  The ministry mentioned is also incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Jaya was the first *rice*, not wheat, variety released in India.  The question uses a close but incorrect fact to create a distractor. ICAR did play a crucial role in developing high-yielding varieties for both rice and wheat, instrumental in the Green Revolution.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions ICAR's role in coordinating agricultural research and education and its involvement in establishing the National Gene Bank. This highlights its national significance in agricultural development.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on factual recall and analysis, with plausible distractors to test a deeper understanding of the subject.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association primarily advocated for complete independence from British rule, rejecting socialist ideals.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru's vision for India incorporated socialist principles, but he did not explicitly endorse secularism.
3.  The inclusion of "Socialist" and "Secular" in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution reflects a post-independence shift in national ideology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Hindustan Republican Association, while aiming for complete independence, was significantly associated with socialist ideals.  Many of its prominent members, like Bhagat Singh, were strong advocates of socialist and anti-imperialist ideologies.  Their actions and writings clearly demonstrate a commitment to socialist principles as a means to achieve national liberation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Jawaharlal Nehru was a prominent advocate for both socialism and secularism. His economic policies and vision for independent India leaned heavily towards socialist principles, and his commitment to secularism was a cornerstone of his political philosophy.  The idea of a secular, democratic India was central to his vision.

Statement 3 is correct. The addition of "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 reflects a conscious effort to codify these evolving national ideals into the fundamental document of the Indian state. This amendment marked a significant shift in the official articulation of India's post-independence political and economic goals.  While these ideals were present in the pre-independence movement in varying degrees, their formal inclusion in the Preamble signifies their enhanced importance in the post-independence era.


**2. With reference to the evolution of the Indian Constitution's Preamble, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Objectives Resolution, drafted and introduced by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, formed the basis of the Preamble.
2.  The Preamble, as originally adopted, included the terms "Socialist" and "Secular".
3.  K.M. Munshi played a significant role in drafting the Preamble, emphasizing its importance as the soul of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Objectives Resolution, which served as the foundational document for the Preamble, was drafted and introduced by Jawaharlal Nehru, not Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.  Nehru's resolution outlined the key principles and aspirations that would later shape the Preamble.  Patel played a crucial role in the integration of princely states, but his primary contributions lay in that realm.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The terms "Socialist" and "Secular" were not part of the original Preamble.  These terms were added later through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. The original Preamble focused on the core principles of sovereignty, socialism, democracy, republic, justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.

Statement 3 is correct. K.M. Munshi, a member of the Drafting Committee, played a significant role in shaping the Preamble. He was a strong advocate for its inclusion in the Constitution and emphasized its importance as a statement of the nation's fundamental values and aspirations.  His views on the Preamble's significance as the "soul" of the Constitution are well-documented.



**3. With reference to the ideological underpinnings of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 19(1)(g) explicitly guarantees the right to form socialist organizations, irrespective of their political objectives.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy, while emphasizing non-violence and self-sufficiency, was fundamentally opposed to socialist ideals.
3.  The inclusion of "Socialist" in the Preamble signifies the Constitution's commitment to a mixed economy, incorporating both private and public sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 19(1)(g) guarantees the right to form associations or unions, it doesn't specifically mention or limit this right to socialist organizations.  The right extends to various types of associations, including those with diverse political and ideological orientations.  The statement incorrectly links the article to a specific ideological commitment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Mahatma Gandhi's vision differed from the Marxist interpretation of socialism, he did advocate for certain socialist principles, such as Gram Swaraj and a focus on self-reliance and equitable distribution of resources.  His emphasis on trusteeship and social justice aligns, in some aspects, with socialist thought, though not with state-controlled socialism.

Statement 3 is correct. The inclusion of "Socialist" in the Preamble, though added later, reflects a commitment to a welfare state and a mixed economy where the state plays a significant role in regulating and guiding economic activity. It didn't necessarily imply complete nationalization or the abolition of the private sector.  The statement accurately captures the nuanced nature of the Constitution's economic philosophy.


**4. With reference to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble can be amended only through a simple majority in Parliament, as per Article 368.
2. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added the words "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble.
3.  The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) established that the Preamble is not a part of the Basic Structure of the Indian Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Preamble, while amendable, is not subject to amendment through a simple majority.  The process of amending the constitution, including the preamble, requires a special majority in Parliament, as per Article 368, alongside other procedural requirements.  The statement simplifies a complex constitutional process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 is indeed the amendment that added the words "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble, along with the word "Integrity". This amendment reflected the evolving understanding of the Indian nation's political and economic goals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) established the Basic Structure doctrine but did not specifically address the Preamble's position within this framework.  Later judicial pronouncements clarified that the Preamble forms an integral part of the Basic Structure.  The statement misrepresents the findings of the landmark case.


**5. With reference to the  amendment of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016, introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
2.  Amendments to the Constitution require ratification by at least two-thirds of the state legislatures.
3.  The basic structure doctrine, as established by the Supreme Court, limits the Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act of 2016 is indeed the act that introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, creating a unified indirect tax system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While certain constitutional amendments may require ratification by the states, this is not universally true for all amendments. The requirement of state ratification varies depending on the specific nature of the amendment in question.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the amendment process.

Statement 3 is correct. The basic structure doctrine, developed through judicial interpretation, limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, particularly those aspects that are considered fundamental to the nation's democratic framework. This includes certain fundamental rights.  The statement correctly reflects the impact of the basic structure doctrine on the amendment process.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, or until the age of 62, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG's decisions are final and binding and cannot be challenged in any court of law.
3. The CAG is responsible for auditing the receipts and expenditure of only the Central Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG is appointed by the President for a six-year term or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  The UPSC syllabus emphasizes the constitutional provisions related to the CAG's appointment and tenure, highlighting the significance of this independent institution in maintaining financial accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CAG's reports hold significant weight and influence, their findings are not legally binding and can be challenged. The CAG acts as a quasi-judicial body, investigating and reporting on financial irregularities, but its ultimate authority rests with the Parliament.  Understanding the CAG's role within the larger context of India's parliamentary democracy is crucial for UPSC aspirants.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CAG audits the receipts and expenditure of both the Central and State Governments, as well as other bodies substantially financed by the government. The comprehensive nature of the CAG's audit function is a key aspect of its mandate to ensure transparency and good governance.  


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution explicitly mentions Sanskrit as the national language.
2. The Constitution guarantees the right to vote only to citizens above the age of 21.
3. The Constitution establishes a bicameral legislature consisting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not declare any language as the national language.  This reflects the Constitution's commitment to linguistic diversity and its recognition of multiple languages.  The absence of a national language and the constitutional provisions relating to language are frequently tested in the UPSC exam.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution guarantees universal adult suffrage, meaning the right to vote is extended to all citizens who have attained the age of 18, not 21.  The lowering of the voting age from 21 to 18 is a significant constitutional amendment that showcases India's commitment to democratic principles.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian Constitution establishes a bicameral Parliament, comprising the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). The structure and functions of the Parliament are critical topics in the UPSC syllabus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCI's decisions are generally considered final and are not subject to judicial review. However, this does not imply absolute immunity;  the Supreme Court might intervene in cases of gross violation of fundamental rights or if there is a clear procedural lapse.  The relationship between the PCI and the judiciary is a nuanced area that requires careful understanding for the UPSC.

Statement 3 is correct. The PCI can take suo moto action or investigate complaints related to unethical reporting or interference with press freedom. This reflects the PCI's role as a self-regulatory body for the press, aiming to uphold journalistic ethics and protect press freedom.

These eight questions provide a comprehensive test of knowledge related to the Indian Constitution, its institutions, and important legal frameworks, mirroring the style and difficulty level of UPSC questions.  They also showcase the importance of understanding the nuances and details of these institutions and laws.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level by incorporating misleading information and plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Red Sea:**

1.  The Red Sea is bordered by six countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Eritrea, and Djibouti, and its waters are among the saltiest in the world.
2.  The Red Sea is an inlet of the Indian Ocean, situated between the continents of Africa and Asia, and it partially overlaps with the Great Rift Valley.
3.  The Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden are major waterways connecting the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Red Sea is indeed bordered by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Eritrea, and Djibouti. Its high salinity is also a well-known characteristic. However, the statement implies that these are the *only* six bordering countries which is inaccurate, as other countries share smaller coastlines on the Red Sea.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Red Sea is an inlet of the Indian Ocean and lies between Africa and Asia. The assertion that it *partially overlaps* with the Great Rift Valley is a point of contention. While the Red Sea is geologically associated with the Rift Valley system, stating a partial overlap is an oversimplification of a complex geological process.  The Red Sea's formation is directly linked to the rifting, but it doesn't precisely "overlap" in the way the statement implies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Bab el Mandeb strait correctly connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. However, the Gulf of Aden connects the Indian Ocean to the Arabian Sea, but it does not directly connect to the Red Sea. The Gulf of Aden is connected to the Red Sea via the Bab el Mandeb Strait.


**2. With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chabahar Port, located on the Makran Coast of Iran, is the only Iranian port with direct access to the Arabian Sea, situated approximately 170 kilometers west of Pakistan's Gwadar Port.
2.  In 2016, India signed a tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan for the development of Shahid Kalantari terminal at Chabahar Port, aiming to bypass Pakistan and access Central Asia.
3.  The Chabahar Port is part of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a multimodal project connecting the Indian Ocean to Northern Europe, and its closest Indian port is Kandla Port.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Chabahar Port is on Iran's Makran Coast and is close to Gwadar Port, it's inaccurate to say it's the *only* Iranian port with direct access to the Arabian Sea. Other Iranian ports also have access, although Chabahar's strategic location is significant.  Further, the Arabian Sea is a marginal sea of the Indian Ocean, not a separate entity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The tripartite agreement was indeed signed in 2016, but it was for the development of the Shahid Beheshti terminal, not Shahid Kalantari. The goal of bypassing Pakistan to access Afghanistan and Central Asia is accurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chabahar Port is indeed part of the INSTC, connecting the Indian Ocean to Northern Europe. While Kandla is closer to Chabahar than Mumbai in terms of nautical miles, it is not the closest port in all calculations. The statement uses distance comparisons to create a plausible but incorrect assumption.



**3. With reference to the India-UAE relationship, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UAE is India’s third-largest trading partner, and India has a significant trade deficit with the UAE, with the UAE being the second-largest export destination for Indian goods.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UAE is indeed India's third-largest trading partner, but India has a *trade deficit*, not a surplus, with the UAE.  The statement also incorrectly states that UAE is the second-largest export destination for Indian goods.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The CEPA was signed before 2023, and while it aims to boost trade and investment, the direct linkage of UPI and IPP, though a recent development, wasn't a core part of the original CEPA.


Statement 3 is correct.  The UAE does have a large Indian diaspora, a major source of remittances.  The joint military exercises, such as Desert Flag, also accurately reflect the nature of the defense and security cooperation.



**4. Consider the following statements about the Himalayan mountain range:**

1.  The Himalayas, formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates, are primarily located in India and extend through Pakistan and Afghanistan, influencing the monsoon patterns and climate of South Asia.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Sanyukt Vimochan 2024, a bilateral exercise focusing solely on disaster relief strategies, was conducted by the Indian Army.
2.  The Indian Navy played a significant role in Sanyukt Vimochan 2024, deploying its specialized disaster relief units to Gujarat's coastal areas.
3.  Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 involved participation from foreign delegations, showcasing India's preparedness for international humanitarian assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 was a *multilateral*, not a bilateral exercise. While disaster relief was a key component, it also encompassed broader humanitarian assistance and disaster response capabilities. The Indian Army led the exercise, but the statement's limitation to only disaster relief and exclusion of other aspects makes it inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage clearly states that Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 involved various Indian armed forces, including the Army, and disaster management agencies. There's no mention of specific Indian Navy involvement.  Including the Navy as a major player is a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The exercise explicitly involved foreign delegations, demonstrating India's readiness for international cooperation in disaster response. This aligns perfectly with the passage's description.


**2. With reference to the Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 exercise, consider the following statements:**

1. The Table Top Exercise (TTX) simulated a flood scenario in the mountainous regions of Gujarat.
2.  The exercise primarily focused on showcasing India's technological advancements in disaster management.
3.  Various Indian disaster management agencies, besides the armed forces, participated in the exercise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TTX simulated a *cyclone*, not a flood scenario, and specifically in Gujarat's *coastal* region, not mountainous areas.  This plays on the common association of floods with mountainous terrain to mislead the candidate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the exercise undoubtedly showcased India's disaster response readiness, the passage doesn't highlight technological advancements as the *primary* focus. The emphasis is on overall preparedness and the involvement of diverse agencies.  Focusing on technology as the primary aspect is a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the exercise involved various Indian armed forces *and* disaster management agencies, indicating a broader participation beyond just the military.


**3. With reference to Gujarat's geographical features and their impact on Sanyukt Vimochan 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The arid climate of Gujarat's coastal region posed a significant challenge during the exercise's practical phases.
2.  The extensive mangrove cover along Gujarat's coast aided in mitigating the impact of the simulated cyclone.
3.  The proximity of Gujarat to the Arabian Sea made it an ideal location to simulate a coastal cyclone scenario.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention challenges posed by the arid climate during the practical phases of the exercise; the focus is on the cyclone simulation.  Linking aridity to the exercise's challenges is a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage does mention Gujarat's mangrove cover, but it does not connect it to mitigating the cyclone's impact during the exercise.  This creates a false link between mangrove cover and disaster mitigation within the context of the exercise.

Statement 3 is correct. The exercise's location in Gujarat's coastal region, bordering the Arabian Sea, perfectly suits the simulation of a coastal cyclone. The choice of Gujarat is directly justified by its geographical location.


**4. Consider the following statements about Project Veer Gatha 4.0:**

1.  Project Veer Gatha 4.0 exclusively focused on the creation of video documentaries about gallantry award winners.
2. The Ministry of Education solely funded Project Veer Gatha 4.0.
3. The felicitation ceremony for the winners of Project Veer Gatha 4.0 will be held during the Republic Day celebrations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Project Veer Gatha 4.0 encouraged projects in various formats (poems, essays, paintings, and videos), not exclusively video documentaries. This limits the scope of the project to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Project Veer Gatha 4.0 is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Defence, not solely funded by the Ministry of Education. Attributing sole funding to one ministry is a common distractor technique.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly states that the felicitation of winners will be a joint event by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Defence during the upcoming Republic Day.


**5. With reference to the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), consider the following statements:**

1. AIM exclusively focuses on providing financial assistance to startups in the Information Technology sector.
2. Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs) are established only in urban areas under AIM.
3.  The Mentor of Change program is a key component of AIM, aiming to provide mentorship and support to various initiatives.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AIM supports innovation across various sectors, not exclusively IT.  Limiting the scope to only one sector is a common distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ATLs are established in schools, targeting both urban and rural areas, to encourage STEM education and innovation at the grassroots level. Restricting the location to only urban areas is a misleading statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the Mentor of Change program as a crucial component of AIM, designed to support various initiatives through mentorship and partnerships.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Defence Space Agency is headquartered in Bengaluru, Karnataka, not Mumbai.  While it operates within the framework of the Indian Armed Forces, the statement's implication of direct oversight by the Ministry of Defence alone is an oversimplification; it's an integrated tri-services agency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text mentions Antariksha Abhyas – 2024 as a first-of-its-kind exercise designed to war-game threats to and from space-based assets and services. This implies a broader scope than solely focusing on offensive capabilities; it also addresses vulnerabilities and defensive strategies.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that the DSA is tasked with operating India's space-warfare and satellite intelligence assets, which are core components of space-based assets and services.  Therefore, this accurately reflects a primary function of the DSA.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CISF's mandate is not border guarding; that responsibility falls under other agencies like the Border Security Force (BSF). The CISF focuses on the security of vital installations within the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CISF is indeed an armed force established under the Central Industrial Security Force Act, 1968, it operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of External Affairs.  The Ministry of External Affairs deals with international relations.

Statement 3 is correct. The provided text clearly indicates that the CISF provides security to strategic establishments, including the Department of Space and the Department of Atomic Energy, highlighting its role in safeguarding critical national infrastructure.


**3. With reference to Exercise Sea Vigil, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Exercise Sea Vigil, while designed to bolster coastal defence, is not an annual event. The text explicitly states it's a periodic exercise.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the scope of Exercise Sea Vigil, covering the entire coastline and EEZ, and including the participation of the fishing community and coastal population.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sea Vigil acts as a precursor to TROPEX, TROPEX is conducted by the Indian Navy, not the Indian Coast Guard, as stated in the provided information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text specifies that the inaugural IONS was held in 2008, not 2015. While it is a voluntary initiative aimed at enhancing maritime cooperation, the founding year is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the IONS's objective of enhancing maritime cooperation among navies of the littoral states in the IOR.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text does not mention the location of the inaugural IONS, but it does state that it was held in India in 2008.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While UNCTAD promotes equitable participation in the global economy, its primary focus is on assisting developing countries.  The emphasis is on bridging the development gap, not specifically regulating trade practices among developed nations which is primarily the purview of the WTO.

Statement 2 is correct. UNCTAD's publications include the "World Investment Report" and the "Global Investment Trends Monitor," providing crucial data and analysis on global investment flows.  These reports are widely used by policymakers and researchers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. UNCTAD is a part of the United Nations, but it's not a specialized agency responsible for coordinating all economic and social development programs.  Various UN agencies, including UNDP, UNICEF, and WHO, have specific mandates in this area. UNCTAD's focus is more narrowly defined on trade, investment, finance, and technology's role in development, particularly for developing countries.

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directly controls the fiscal policy of the Government of India.
2. The RBI's monetary policy primarily focuses on managing inflation and exchange rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI is responsible for monetary policy, while the Government of India is responsible for fiscal policy.  While they interact closely, their functions are distinct. The government sets the budget, while the RBI manages money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic stability.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's core mandate includes maintaining price stability (controlling inflation) and managing the exchange rate of the Indian rupee.  These are crucial components of its monetary policy framework, aimed at fostering macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the RBI is the primary authority responsible for issuing currency, the actual printing of notes is undertaken by the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL), under the purview of the Ministry of Finance. The RBI regulates the volume of currency in circulation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  EFTA is a free trade area, not a common market like the EU. While it promotes free trade in goods, services, and capital among its members, it doesn't include the free movement of people as a core objective.  The focus is primarily on economic cooperation without the extensive integration of the EU.

Statement 2 is correct. The EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) plays a crucial role in ensuring that EFTA member states comply with the organization's rules and regulations.  It monitors trade practices, investigates potential violations, and takes necessary actions to maintain the integrity of the EFTA agreement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. EFTA members such as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland are not members of the European Union.  EFTA offers an alternative route to economic integration in Europe for countries that choose not to join the EU.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICA is not a regulatory body. It's a global advocacy organization uniting and representing cooperatives worldwide. It does not have the authority to set binding standards or enforce compliance among cooperatives.  Its role is primarily to promote the cooperative model and advance their interests.

Statement 2 is correct. The ICA actively advocates for the interests of cooperatives at international levels. It participates in discussions at the WTO, UN, and other bodies to ensure that the unique needs and challenges of cooperatives are taken into account in international policymaking.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the ICA may facilitate access to funding or resources, it is not a primary source of financial aid or grants for cooperative projects.  Its primary function is in promoting the cooperative business model and providing a global network for cooperation and information sharing.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Resolution 1701 called for a complete cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, a key component of ending the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Statement 2 is correct.  The resolution significantly expanded the mandate of UNIFIL, providing it with enhanced powers to monitor the ceasefire, support the Lebanese Armed Forces, and contribute to a more stable security environment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Resolution 1701 indirectly contributed to creating conditions for economic recovery, its primary focus was on establishing a ceasefire, ensuring the security of Lebanon, and preventing future conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah.  Economic development was a secondary, albeit important, consideration.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. OPEC+ comprises both OPEC member countries and several significant non-OPEC oil-producing nations, such as Russia. This broader membership allows for a more coordinated approach to managing global oil supply.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The primary goal of OPEC+ is not to maximize global oil production but rather to stabilize the oil market and influence prices.  This involves coordinating production levels among member countries to prevent drastic price fluctuations that could harm both producers and consumers.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the RBI Governor is appointed by the President of India,  the precise term length may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the appointment.  It is not rigidly fixed at five years.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI has a broad regulatory mandate over the Indian financial system, including commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, NBFCs, and other financial institutions.  It aims to ensure the stability and efficiency of the financial system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the RBI manages a significant portion of India's foreign exchange reserves, this is not its primary function.  Its core mandate centers on monetary policy, financial regulation, and maintaining the stability of the financial system.  Managing foreign exchange reserves is a secondary, albeit important, aspect of its operations.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ISA is indeed responsible for regulating mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond national jurisdiction, with a particular focus on environmental protection during deep-sea mining operations.  It functions under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ISA's headquarters are located in Kingston, Jamaica, not Geneva, Switzerland.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While most UN member states are members of the ISA, membership isn't automatic. States must ratify UNCLOS to become members of the ISA.  Therefore, not all UN members are automatically ISA members.


**10. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. IPEF is a free trade agreement among its member countries, aiming to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers.
2. India is a founding member of IPEF.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IPEF is not a traditional free trade agreement.  It's a framework for economic cooperation that focuses on a broader set of issues than just tariff reduction. While it aims to facilitate trade, it doesn't involve the elimination of all tariffs or trade barriers in the same way a traditional FTA would.

Statement 2 is correct. India was among the founding members of the IPEF. It actively participates in the framework's various pillars.

Statement 3 is correct. IPEF's scope extends to several crucial areas beyond traditional trade negotiations, including building resilient supply chains, promoting clean energy technologies, and fostering cooperation in the digital economy.  This comprehensive approach distinguishes it from traditional FTAs.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the locations of significant international agreements and meetings:**

1. The Minamata Convention on Mercury was adopted in Rome, Italy, highlighting the global concern over mercury pollution.
2. The 12th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) was held in Geneva, Switzerland, showcasing the organization's role in regulating international trade.
3. Joint meetings of the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm Conventions, focused on managing hazardous chemicals and wastes, are held annually in Rome, alternating with Geneva.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Minamata Convention on Mercury was adopted in Geneva, Switzerland, not Rome.  Rome is significant in the context of other international organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), but not for this specific convention. The convention's location in Geneva underscores the importance of international cooperation and the role of organizations headquartered there in addressing global environmental challenges.

Statement 2 is correct.  Geneva is indeed the headquarters of the WTO, and the 12th Ministerial Conference was held there. This highlights Geneva's significance as a global hub for international trade discussions and negotiations. The choice of Geneva underscores the city's established role in facilitating international cooperation on economic matters.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm Conventions do meet annually in alternating locations between Geneva and Rome, the statement incorrectly specifies that the meetings are held *only* in Rome. The rotation of meeting locations between Geneva and Rome reflects a broader international effort to decentralize these important conventions and ensure wider participation from various regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) is administered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), not the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).  While WWF is a significant player in conservation efforts and often collaborates with the CMS, it does not administer the treaty itself.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Amur Falcon's extensive migratory route, including its passage over India and the Indian Ocean, falls under the purview of the CMS.  The CMS specifically addresses the conservation of migratory species and their habitats across international boundaries.  The Amur Falcon's trans-continental migration makes it a prime candidate for protection under this treaty.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The frequency of CMS CoPs is not fixed at every two years.  The CoPs are convened periodically, as determined by the needs of the treaty's implementation and review processes. The intervals between CoPs can vary depending on the agenda and the urgency of conservation issues that need attention.



**3. With reference to Green Hydrogen, consider the following statements:**

1. Grey Hydrogen production through steam methane reforming (SMR) is a carbon-neutral process.
2. Green Hydrogen production emits no greenhouse gases or pollutants during the electrolysis process itself, but the overall lifecycle emissions can be influenced by electricity generation.
3. The Steel sector is among the industries exploring the use of green hydrogen for decarbonization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Grey hydrogen production using steam methane reforming (SMR) is *not* carbon-neutral.  SMR involves reacting natural gas (methane) with steam at high temperatures to produce hydrogen. This process releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct, contributing substantially to greenhouse gas emissions.  Therefore, grey hydrogen is considered a high-carbon energy source.

Statement 2 is correct. The electrolysis process of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity *itself* produces no direct greenhouse gas emissions. However, the overall environmental impact depends heavily on the source of the electricity used in the electrolysis process. If the electricity is generated from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas), the process is not truly "green."  Only when renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro) power the electrolysis is the resulting hydrogen considered green, minimizing the overall carbon footprint.

Statement 3 is correct. The steel industry is actively researching and implementing green hydrogen technologies for decarbonizing its processes. Steel production is a highly energy-intensive process with large carbon emissions. Green hydrogen offers a potential pathway to reduce these emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based processes with hydrogen-based reduction methods.



**4. With reference to the Paris Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Paris Agreement legally mandates specific emission reduction targets for each signatory nation.

3. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paris Agreement does *not* legally mandate specific emission reduction targets for each signatory nation. Instead, it employs a system of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), where each country sets its own targets based on its capabilities and circumstances.  While the agreement encourages ambitious targets and global cooperation, it does not impose legally binding, uniform reduction targets on all countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NDCs are *not* static commitments. The Paris Agreement explicitly encourages countries to review and update their NDCs every five years, reflecting their progress, enhanced capabilities, and increased ambition in tackling climate change.  Regular updates are crucial to ensure the agreement's effectiveness in achieving its long-term goals.

Statement 3 is correct. The core objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. This ambitious target recognizes the potentially catastrophic consequences of exceeding these thresholds and underscores the urgency of global climate action.

The Act's core purpose is to conserve forests and prevent their conversion for other uses.  It is a key legal instrument in India's efforts to combat deforestation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the  impact of the Kesavananda Bharati judgment (1973), consider the following statements:**

1. The judgment introduced the "Basic Structure Doctrine," limiting Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.
2.  The judgment declared that the Preamble is not a part of the Constitution and hence unamendable.
3. The Golak Nath case (1967) ruling, which restricted Parliament's amending power regarding Fundamental Rights, was overturned by the Kesavananda Bharati judgment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kesavananda Bharati judgment is pivotal in Indian constitutional law for establishing the "Basic Structure Doctrine." This doctrine significantly limits Parliament's ability to amend the Constitution, preventing alterations that would destroy its fundamental features.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this key outcome. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Kesavananda Bharati judgment clarified that the Preamble is part of the Constitution and therefore amendable, although its essential features remain protected under the Basic Structure Doctrine.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. While Kesavananda Bharati did address the implications of Golak Nath, it didn't explicitly overturn it.  Instead, it offered a nuanced approach, affirming Parliament's amending power but simultaneously introducing the Basic Structure Doctrine as a safeguard against the complete abrogation of fundamental rights.  The judgment implicitly modified the Golak Nath precedent by allowing amendments to fundamental rights as long as the basic structure remained intact.  Thus, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.

(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while decreased atmospheric pressure is the cause, HAS typically manifests at altitudes above 8,000 feet, not necessarily 10,000 feet. The threshold altitude can vary based on individual factors. Statement 2 is correct; acclimatization is essential for preventing HAS; gradual ascent allows the body to adapt to lower oxygen levels, while medications play a supportive role in managing symptoms but are not a complete solution. Statement 3 is correct; the mentioned symptoms (headache, nausea, shortness of breath) are common manifestations of HAS.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**15. With reference to the ‘Laxman Naskar versus Union of India’ Judgement, consider the following statements:**

1. The judgment primarily deals with the right to education.
2. The judgment pertains to issues concerning preventive detention.
3. The judgment addresses the rights of prisoners concerning remission of sentences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Laxman Naskar judgment doesn't directly focus on the right to education.  It deals with a different area of law. Statement 2 is incorrect; the judgment does not primarily involve preventive detention. Statement 3 is correct; the case centers around a prisoner's rights concerning remission (reduction or cancellation) of a sentence. The case dealt with the legality and fairness of the remission process in the context of  prisoner's rights.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**16.  With reference to the  Bibek Debroy Committee's recommendations on Indian Railways, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee recommended a shift to accrual accounting to enhance financial transparency.
2. The committee's primary objective was to reduce operating costs through simplified accounting.
3. The committee advocated for the privatization of Indian Railways' financial operations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Bibek Debroy Committee's recommendations emphasized a shift to accrual accounting for Indian Railways.  Accrual accounting provides a more comprehensive and transparent view of the railway's financial health. Statement 2 is incorrect; the committee's main goal was not simply cost reduction through simplified accounting. While cost efficiency was a consideration, the primary focus was on improved transparency and accountability. Statement 3 is incorrect; the committee's recommendations did not advocate for the privatization of Indian Railways' financial operations.  The focus was on internal reforms and improved financial management.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**17. With reference to the country that recently announced a public ban on facial coverings, consider the following statements:**

1. The ban will take effect on January 1, 2025, and applies to all public spaces.
2. The ban is intended to enhance national security and prevent criminal activity.
3.  The country is known for its strong secular traditions and commitment to religious freedom.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; while the ban on facial coverings (like the burqa) is set to take effect on January 1, 2025, the specific details about its applicability to *all* public spaces might need further clarification depending on the specific legislation. Statement 2 is correct; bans on facial coverings are often justified on grounds of national security and crime prevention.  Such restrictions aim to improve surveillance and deter criminal activities. Statement 3 is incorrect; the implementation of a burqa ban often creates tensions with those who see it as an infringement on religious freedom. The country's stance on religious freedom is therefore not universally consistent with the ban. Thus,  statements 1 and 2 (with slight modification to 1) are more consistent with the reality of a burqa ban.


**18. With reference to the  ‘State of Food and Agriculture 2024’ report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report is published annually by the World Bank.
2. The report focuses on global food security challenges and sustainable agricultural practices.
3. The report provides detailed country-specific analyses of food production and consumption patterns.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the "State of Food and Agriculture" report is published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), not the World Bank. Statement 2 is correct; the report analyzes global food security, focusing on challenges like hunger, malnutrition, and the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Statement 3 is correct; the report typically presents data and analysis at a country-specific level, providing insights into food production, consumption, and trade dynamics.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**19. With reference to the  Sanskrit word ‘Kutumb Prabodhan,’ consider the following statements:**

1. The term is related to family values and promoting traditional family structures.
2. The term is primarily associated with financial management and economic literacy within families.
3. The term relates to the promotion of health and wellness within the family unit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; "Kutumb Prabodhan" translates to family awakening or enlightenment, suggesting a focus on strengthening family values and promoting traditional family structures. Statement 2 is incorrect; the term is not directly linked to financial management or economic literacy.  While financial stability might contribute to a strong family, the term's core meaning is different. Statement 3 is partially correct; a strong family structure can positively influence health and wellness, but "Kutumb Prabodhan" is not primarily about health and wellness initiatives.  Therefore, only statement 1 is the most accurate interpretation of the term's meaning.


**20.  With reference to the  Olympic Games, consider the following statements:**

1. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Olympia, Greece, in the 8th century BCE.
2. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece.
3.  Japan and China are the only Asian countries to have hosted the Olympic Games.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Olympic Games did originate in ancient Olympia, Greece, during the 8th century BCE, in honor of Zeus. Statement 2 is correct; the first modern Olympic Games were indeed held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, marking the revival of the ancient tradition. Statement 3 is incorrect; several Asian countries beyond Japan and China have hosted the Olympic Games, including South Korea.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  The question is designed to mislead by using close but inaccurate dates.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements about the International Solar Alliance (ISA):**

1. The ISA's framework agreement has been signed by over 150 countries, demonstrating widespread global support for solar energy initiatives.
2.  The ISA secretariat is located in Paris, France, a key player in the Alliance's founding and ongoing operations.
3. The ISA primarily focuses on promoting solar energy technologies and facilitating the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement through the deployment of renewable energy sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ISA has significant global participation, the provided text states that 120 countries are signatories to the framework agreement, not over 150.  The number of signatories may have increased since the text was written, but the question must rely solely on the information provided.  This serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to avoid assumptions based on current knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ISA secretariat is located in Gurugram, India, not Paris, France. Although France was a joint founder of the ISA, the secretariat's location is a crucial detail often overlooked, making this a good distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The ISA's core objective is to promote solar energy and contribute to the Paris Climate Agreement's implementation through renewable energy deployment. This statement directly reflects the text's description of the ISA's aims.  The inclusion of "renewable energy sources" broadens the scope slightly, but does not make the statement incorrect.


**2. With reference to the 4B movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 4B movement originated in South Korea as a direct response to the "escape the corset" movement, gaining traction in the US after Donald Trump's election.
2. The acronym "4B" represents four Korean words, each signifying a rejection of a specific aspect of traditional male-female relationships, including marriage and childbearing.
3.  The movement's proponents argue that women should withhold emotional labor, romantic relationships, and procreation until men actively contribute to gender equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The movement did originate in South Korea, but its rise in the US following Donald Trump's election is a separate event. It started after the MeToo movement, not solely in response to the "escape the corset" movement. The chronological connection is crucial but often misinterpreted.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that "4B stands for the four “Nos”, B is a shorthand for no in Korean," and lists the four rejections. This is a detail demanding specific knowledge of the movement's terminology.

Statement 3 accurately reflects the movement's core philosophy. Proponents believe that women shouldn't provide traditional relationship contributions unless men actively work towards gender justice. This statement tests understanding of the movement's underlying ideology.


**3. With reference to the Adaptation Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report, published biennially by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), assesses global progress on climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.
2.  The "adaptation gap" refers to the discrepancy between the actual adaptation measures implemented and the necessary adaptation needs to reduce climate change risks.
3. The 2024 report, titled "Come Hell and High Water," highlights a widening gap between adaptation efforts and the escalating needs due to intensified climate impacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report is published annually, not biennially.  The frequency of publication is a detail easily missed, creating a strong distractor.  The inclusion of mitigation efforts is also a deliberate misdirection. The report focuses specifically on adaptation.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of the "adaptation gap" provided is accurate and directly from the text. This tests the candidate's understanding of key terminology.

Statement 3 is correct. The report's title and the description of its purpose in the text both indicate a focus on the widening gap between adaptation needs and implemented actions. This statement checks for comprehension of the report's central theme.


**4. With reference to cybersecurity incident reporting under the Information Technology Act, 2000, consider the following statements:**

1.  Only service providers are mandated to report cybersecurity incidents to designated authorities.
2.  The government's aim in mandating incident reporting includes enhancing collective security through information sharing.
3.  Incident reporting is intended to encourage organizations to adopt robust cybersecurity measures, thereby reducing the frequency and impact of future attacks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that *all* entities handling sensitive personal information or critical information infrastructure, including service providers, data centers, and body corporates, are legally obligated to report.  This is a crucial detail often missed, designed to test the candidate's precise reading comprehension.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions facilitating information sharing to enhance collective security as a government objective for mandating reporting.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly states that encouraging organizations to adopt robust cybersecurity measures is a goal of the mandatory reporting system.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the policy's purpose.



**5. With reference to the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development, consider the following statements:**

1. The prize, instituted in 1996, is awarded biennially by the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust to individuals or institutions for exceptional contributions to peace and development.
2. The 2023 prize was jointly awarded to Daniel Barenboim and Ali Abu Awwad for their work in promoting peace and cultural understanding.
3.  The prize includes a monetary award of ₹25 lakh and a citation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The prize was instituted in 1986, not 1996, and it's awarded annually, not biennially.  The slight alteration in the year and frequency creates confusion.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the 2023 prize was awarded to Daniel Barenboim and Ali Abu Awwad.  This tests factual recall.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly specifies the monetary award and citation as part of the prize. This also tests factual recall.


**6. With reference to high-altitude sickness (AMS), consider the following statements:**

1.  AMS primarily affects individuals at elevations below 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), where oxygen levels are significantly reduced.
2.  Acetazolamide and Dexamethasone are commonly used medications to treat AMS, while gradual ascent is recommended for prevention.
3. Infrastructural limitations in Himalayan regions hinder the effective management of AMS cases, particularly in remote areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AMS affects individuals at elevations *above* 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), not below.  This is a critical detail that easily misleads.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions both medications and gradual ascent as recommended practices. This tests knowledge of medical interventions for AMS.

Statement 3 is correct. The text directly points out infrastructural challenges as a significant obstacle to managing AMS in Himalayan regions.


**7. With reference to the Prakash Singh judgment on police reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's 2006 judgment mandated police reforms to ensure independence from political interference and enhance efficiency.
2.  The judgment primarily focused on improving police training and recruitment processes.
3. The judgment's implementation has been universally successful across all states and union territories in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The judgment aimed to establish police independence and improve operational effectiveness.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the judgment's core objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the judgment likely touched upon training and recruitment, the primary focus was on ensuring police autonomy from political influence, as stated in the text.  This distractor tests the ability to distinguish between primary and secondary aspects of a landmark judgment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The judgment's implementation hasn't been uniformly successful across all states and union territories in India.  This tests awareness of the practical challenges in implementing judicial pronouncements.



**8. With reference to the Rohini Nayyar Prize, consider the following statements:**

1.  The prize, established in 2000, is awarded annually to individuals under 40 who have made significant contributions to rural development in India.
2. The prize recognizes achievements across various sectors, including civil society, government, enterprise, and academia, and carries a monetary award of ₹5 lakh.
3. The 2023 prize was awarded to Anil Pradhan for his work in promoting STEM education in rural India.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The prize was established in 1986, not 2000. The year of establishment is a frequently overlooked detail. The age limit and focus on rural development are correct.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The prize does recognize achievements across various sectors and includes a citation, but the monetary award is ₹10 lakh, not ₹5 lakh.  The amount of the monetary award is a detail intended to mislead.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions Anil Pradhan as the 2023 recipient and his area of contribution.


**9. With reference to the Bibek Debroy Committee recommendations on Indian Railways, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee recommended complete privatization of Indian Railways to enhance efficiency and competition.
2.  The committee suggested empowering railway officials with greater autonomy in decision-making.
3. The committee recommended establishing a Rail Development Authority (RDA) as an independent regulatory body.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The committee recommended *liberalization*, not complete privatization.  The distinction between liberalization and privatization is a key concept in economics and policy.

Statement 2 is correct.  Empowering railway officials was a key recommendation, as stated in the text.

Statement 3 is correct. The establishment of an RDA was another significant suggestion.


**10. With reference to Switzerland's "burqa ban," consider the following statements:**

1. The ban, effective January 1, 2024, prohibits the wearing of all types of face coverings in public places across Switzerland.
2. Violators of the ban face fines of up to 1,000 Swiss francs (approximately ₹96,280).

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ban's effective date is January 1, 2025, not 2024. The specific date is a detail easily forgotten. The description of the ban is correct.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the fine amount.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text describes the ban as "contentious," indicating that it lacks universal support. The level of societal support is a significant political aspect.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided knowledge base, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.  I have attempted to create challenging questions with plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the United Nations, consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime mandates the establishment of a World Toilet College.
2.  The Brundtland Commission's report, "Our Common Future," directly influenced the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
3. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) holds the sole authority to define and recognize favorable sex ratios among member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Toilet College was established by the World Toilet Organization (WTO), a separate global non-profit, not the UN.  While the UN collaborates on sanitation issues, it didn't directly establish this specific college.

Statement 2 is partially correct, but needs clarification. The Brundtland Commission's report, "Our Common Future," was highly influential in shaping global environmental discourse and sustainable development goals. However, it didn't directly *create* the UNFCCC. The UNFCCC was a result of a separate international process and negotiations following the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. The Brundtland report laid the groundwork for the discussions that eventually led to the UNFCCC, but it wasn't a direct causal factor in its creation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UN does collect data on sex ratios and addresses gender inequality, but the UNSC does not have the sole authority to define or recognize "favorable" sex ratios.  Such definitions and assessments are complex and involve various UN agencies and international organizations.


**2. With reference to international treaties and agreements, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court grants the UN Security Council veto power over its decisions.
2. The Oslo Peace Accords were primarily negotiated and brokered by the World Bank.
3. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide establishes a specific mechanism for the UN to directly intervene in internal affairs of sovereign states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court (ICC) as an independent body. The UN Security Council does not have veto power over ICC decisions.  While the UNSC can refer situations to the ICC, the ICC operates independently in its judicial processes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Oslo Peace Accords were primarily a result of negotiations between the involved parties, with the UN playing a supporting role. The World Bank was not directly involved in the negotiation process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide condemns genocide as a crime under international law. However, it doesn't provide a direct mechanism for the UN to intervene in a sovereign state's internal affairs unless that intervention is authorized by the UNSC under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which is a rare and exceptional circumstance.  The principle of state sovereignty is a key constraint on UN intervention.


**3. With reference to the Sangeet Natak Akademi Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar is awarded to artists above the age of 40.
2. The Sangeet Natak Akademi confers awards only in the field of classical music and dance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar is specifically for young artists *up to* the age of 40, recognizing their potential in the early stages of their careers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Akademi recognizes classical art forms, its awards encompass a broader range of performing arts, including music, dance, drama, folk & tribal arts, and puppetry.

Statement 3 is correct. The description of the award accurately reflects the components of the Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar and other Akademi awards.  The cash prize, plaque, and angavastram are standard components of the recognition.

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded posthumously only to individuals who made significant contributions after 1966.
2. The President of India solely decides on the recipients of the Bharat Ratna without any recommendations.
3. The award includes a cash prize of ₹1 crore and a certificate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While posthumous awards are permitted for the Bharat Ratna,  the restriction to individuals who made contributions *after* 1966 is false.  Posthumous awards have been given to individuals whose contributions predate that year.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President confers the Bharat Ratna, the process involves recommendations from various sources, including the Prime Minister of India. The President doesn't act unilaterally in this process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna doesn't include a cash prize; it's a purely honorary award.  The components of the award consist of a medal and a certificate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The State of the World’s Children (SOWC) report examines a wide range of issues impacting children, extending beyond just malnutrition and healthcare.  It covers topics such as education, protection, climate change, and other significant factors affecting children's well-being.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SOWC report is an annual flagship report, not published biennially.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While UNICEF focuses heavily on developing countries, its work extends to providing support and advocacy for children's rights globally, including in developed nations.  Its activities encompass both direct aid and broader policy advocacy.


**6. With reference to the  Norway's Sami people, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sami people are primarily concentrated in the southern regions of Europe, including Italy and Spain.
2. The Norwegian government's assimilation policies towards the Sami people were implemented only after World War II.
3. The Sami language is a distinct language family unrelated to other European languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sami people are an Indigenous group inhabiting the Arctic regions of northern Europe, primarily in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Their traditional territories are far from Southern Europe.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Norway's assimilation policies targeting the Sami, Kven, and Forest Finn peoples spanned a much longer period, extending well before World War II.  These policies aimed to suppress their cultural and linguistic identities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sami languages are unique, they belong to the Uralic language family, which has connections to other languages in Eurasia.  They are not entirely isolated from other language families.

(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Loss and Damage Fund was *operationalized* during COP28, but it was first announced during COP27.  It is being administered by the World Bank (initially) not UNEP.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that India *has not* yet signed the COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate and Health.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Global Stocktake is a process that occurs every five years, not every ten years, to evaluate collective progress towards the Paris Agreement goals.

(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission LiFE was launched at UNFCCC COP26 in 2021, not COP27 in 2022.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Meri LiFE app promotes a broader range of sustainable lifestyle choices, encompassing energy conservation, water conservation, waste reduction, sustainable food systems, and healthy lifestyles.  It's not limited to energy conservation alone.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The nodal ministry for Mission LiFE is the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), not the Ministry of Power.


**10. With reference to the  International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICRI was established in 2004 with India as one of its founding members.
2. The Coral Reef Breakthrough initiative aims to protect 50% of the world's shallow-water tropical coral reefs by 2030.
3. ICRI's blended finance approach uses concessional finance to reduce the risk associated with investments in coral reef conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICRI was founded in 1994, not 2004, and India is a member but not a founding member.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors to test in-depth understanding.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Konark Sun Temple:**

1. The Konark Sun Temple's construction utilized primarily sandstone, sourced locally from Odisha's coastal regions.
2.  The temple's iconic chariot-like structure is a unique architectural feat, showcasing a blend of Nagara and Dravidian styles.
3. Narasimhadeva I, ruler of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, is credited with commissioning the Konark Sun Temple's construction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct.  Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty is historically recognized as the patron behind the Konark Sun Temple's construction.  

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some sandstone might have been used, the primary construction materials of the Konark Sun Temple were chlorite, laterite, and khondalite rocks. The source of these materials is not exclusively limited to the immediate coastal region of Odisha but rather sourced from various parts of the state. The use of sandstone as a primary material is a misconception.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Konark Sun Temple's architecture is remarkably unique and does not strictly adhere to either the Nagara or Dravidian styles.  While it incorporates elements that might superficially resemble aspects of both, its overall design is considered a distinct and innovative style, reflecting the ingenuity of Kalinga architecture. The fusion of styles is not a simple blend but a complex synthesis unique to the region.


**2. With reference to the Raigad Fort, consider the following statements:**

1. The British historians' appellation of Raigad Fort as the "Gibraltar of the East" primarily stems from its resemblance to the Gibraltar fortress in terms of its architectural design and strategic placement.
2.  The fort's strategic coastal location, commanding the sea routes, played a crucial role in its designation as the "Gibraltar of the East" by British historians.
3. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's strategic use of Raigad Fort in international trade during his reign significantly contributed to its later description as the "Gibraltar of the East".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The British termed Raigad Fort the "Gibraltar of the East" primarily due to its formidable defensive capabilities and strategically advantageous location, overlooking the coastal region and controlling vital trade routes. The comparison was based on the strength of its fortifications and strategic importance, similar to the impregnability of Gibraltar.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both Raigad and Gibraltar are strategically important, their architectural styles differ significantly.  The architectural comparison is not the primary reason for the British appellation. The comparison was more about the military and strategic importance, not architectural similarities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj used Raigad Fort strategically, its role in international trade was not the primary factor in the British assessment. The British assessment was made later during their rule after Shivaji's time and was based on the fort’s own defensive features.


**3. With reference to the Kumbh Mela, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kumbh Mela's rotation among four pilgrimage sites is determined by astrological calculations based on the conjunction of Jupiter and the Sun.
2.  The Kumbh Mela, held at Rishikesh, Ujjain, Puri, and Prayagraj, is a significant religious event for Hindus, associated with the mythological churning of the ocean.
3. The Kumbh Mela's inclusion in UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity highlights its global cultural significance and its unique religious practices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Kumbh Mela is indeed a major Hindu pilgrimage held at four locations (Haridwar, Prayagraj, Ujjain, and Nashik) and is linked to the mythological churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan).

Statement 3 is correct. The Kumbh Mela's inclusion in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list underscores its global importance and unique rituals.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While astrological calculations are involved in determining the dates and locations of the Kumbh Mela, the statement about the conjunction of Jupiter and the Sun is an oversimplification. The actual calculations are far more complex involving a combination of planetary positions and other astrological factors.  The specific alignment mentioned is not the sole determinant.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question aims for a "difficult" level of difficulty.


**1. With reference to the spread of Buddhism in South and Central Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. The Brahmi script, crucial for disseminating Buddhist texts, predominantly featured Sanskrit words, reflecting the script's origins in the Vedic period.
2. The propagation of Buddhist texts and inscriptions throughout South Asia and beyond was significantly facilitated by the establishment of monastic centers like Nalanda and Vikramshila, primarily in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
3.  Brahmi inscriptions, found across diverse regions of India including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh, date back primarily to the Gupta period, coinciding with the peak of Buddhism's influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Brahmi did originate in India and was later used to write Sanskrit, its primary use in spreading Buddhism was with Prakrit, the language commonly spoken by the masses at the time. The association with Sanskrit is a later development. The Vedic period predates the widespread use of Brahmi in Buddhist texts.

Statement 2 is correct.  The establishment of major Buddhist monastic universities like Nalanda (Bihar) and Vikramshila (Bihar) played a pivotal role in the preservation and dissemination of Buddhist knowledge and texts across South and Central Asia.  These centres served as crucial hubs for learning and scholarship, attracting students and scholars from far-flung regions.  The geographical spread of these institutions is a key factor in understanding the reach of Buddhism.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Brahmi inscriptions are found in the regions mentioned, their dating is primarily linked to the Satavahana and Ikshvaku periods, which precede the Gupta period.  The Gupta period, while significant for the development of Sanskrit and other cultural aspects, is not the primary era for the widespread use of Brahmi in Buddhist texts. The peak of Buddhism's influence in India also predates the Gupta period.


**2. With reference to the socio-political landscape of India during the British Raj, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jayaprakash Narayan, a prominent socialist leader and anti-Emergency icon, initially organized a guerrilla warfare movement to overthrow British rule, later shifting his focus to social reform movements after Mahatma Gandhi's assassination.
2. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, a key figure in the Aligarh Movement, founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875 to promote Western education among Muslims, while simultaneously advocating for complete independence from British rule.
3. The Rampa Rebellion, led by Alluri Sitarama Raju, was primarily a response to the British government's ban on the traditional Podu agricultural system and the imposition of the Madras Forest Act of 1882, which restricted tribal access to forest resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Jayaprakash Narayan did organize an "Azaad Dasta" (freedom brigade) aiming for guerrilla warfare against the British, but he withdrew from active politics after partition and Gandhi's assassination, not solely due to the assassination.  His later focus shifted towards social and political reform through the Bhoodan movement and Sampoorna Kranti.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was indeed a key figure in the Aligarh Movement and founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. However, he did *not* advocate for complete independence from British rule; instead, he adopted a more conciliatory approach, aiming to secure better opportunities for Muslims within the British system.  His stance on the Indian National Congress was one of opposition.

Statement 3 is correct. The Rampa Rebellion, led by Alluri Sitarama Raju, was a direct consequence of the British government's policies. The Madras Forest Act of 1882 severely restricted the tribal communities' access to forest resources and their traditional Podu cultivation practices, leading to widespread resentment and ultimately to the rebellion.  The rebellion's root cause was the economic and social alienation of the tribal population.


**3. With reference to  Indian classical languages, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recognition of Pali as a classical language in 2014 alongside six pre-existing classical languages (Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia)  signifies the government's commitment to preserving the rich linguistic heritage of India.
2.  Prakrit, a language closely related to Sanskrit and the ancestor of several modern Indian languages like Marathi and Pali, is recognized as a classical language, along with Pali, Marathi, Assamese and Bengali, highlighting the linguistic diversity of India.
3.  Important works written in Pali include the Jataka Kathas, Dhammapada, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, illustrating the language’s significance in preserving the Buddhist canon.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Pali is a significant language in India's linguistic heritage and crucial to Buddhism, it was declared a classical language in 2014 along with Assamese and Prakrit. The statement incorrectly lists only the six pre-existing classical languages.


Statement 2 is correct.  Prakrit is indeed recognized as a classical language, alongside Pali, Marathi, Assamese, and Bengali, reflecting the government's effort to acknowledge the historical significance of various languages in India.  The statement correctly identifies the relationship between Prakrit and Sanskrit and its role as an ancestor language.


Statement 3 is correct.  The Jataka Kathas, Dhammapada, and Abhidhamma Pitaka are indeed important works written in Pali, demonstrating the language's crucial role in preserving the Buddhist sacred canon and its rich literary tradition.  The inclusion of these specific works highlights the depth of Pali literature.


**4. With reference to prominent Indian personalities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Thakkar Bapa, the founder of the Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh, was a freedom fighter known for his advocacy for the welfare of underprivileged communities, and his early life involved extensive work as a social worker in rural areas.
2.  Brahmabandhab Upadhyay, a significant figure in the Swadeshi movement, established the journal "Sandhya" in 1904 to advocate for the use of Hindi as the national language, while also promoting Hindu-Muslim unity.
3.  Rukmini Lakshmipathi, a freedom fighter from Andhra Pradesh, participated in the Salt Satyagraha of 1930, becoming the first female prisoner in the movement and later served as the first woman Chief Minister of a state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Thakkar Bapa did found the Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh and was a prominent figure in the freedom struggle and welfare of underprivileged communities. However, his early life was primarily as an engineer, not exclusively as a social worker in rural areas, before he was influenced by Gandhi's philosophy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Brahmabandhab Upadhyay was a key figure in the Swadeshi movement and did found the journal "Sandhya." However, he advocated for revolutionary action and did not primarily focus on Hindi as the national language. He also actively participated in national politics alongside other prominent figures.

Statement 3 is partially correct. Rukmini Lakshmipathi was a freedom fighter from Andhra Pradesh, participated in the Salt Satyagraha and was indeed the first woman prisoner in the movement. However, she became a member of the Legislative Assembly, not a Chief Minister.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding significant events in Indian history:**

1. The Battle of Walong in 1962, fought during the Sino-Indian War, witnessed the Indian army, despite being heavily outnumbered, holding their positions for over 27 days, demonstrating remarkable courage and resilience.
2. The Mera Hou Chongba festival, celebrated in Manipur, is aimed at strengthening the bond between indigenous communities in the hills and the valley, dating back to the reign of the God King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD.
3. The Kittur rebellion, led by Rani Chennamma, was launched in 1824 against the British East India Company's implementation of the Doctrine of Lapse, resulting in the British facing heavy losses and her eventual imprisonment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Battle of Walong was a significant event in the 1962 Sino-Indian War.  The Indian troops, despite being outnumbered, displayed exceptional courage and tenacity, holding off the Chinese forces for an extended period, highlighting the bravery of the Indian soldiers in the face of overwhelming odds.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mera Hou Chongba festival in Manipur is a unique event that brings together hill and valley indigenous communities, fostering unity and strengthening their bonds.  Its historical roots date back to the first century AD, showcasing the long-standing tradition of communal harmony in Manipur.

Statement 3 is correct. Rani Chennamma of Kittur led a rebellion against the British East India Company in 1824, primarily in response to the Doctrine of Lapse. The rebellion resulted in substantial losses for the British forces and ultimately led to Rani Chennamma's capture and imprisonment, underlining her defiance against British rule and highlighting her legacy as a symbol of resistance.


These questions are designed to test not only factual recall but also analytical and evaluative skills, requiring candidates to identify subtle inaccuracies and misleading information within the statements.  The distractors are plausible, making the questions challenging and suitable for a UPSC-level examination.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Sohrai painting, primarily practiced by tribal women in Jharkhand, utilizes natural earth pigments foraged from the wild or sourced locally.
2.  The Sohrai festival in Hazaribagh district, Jharkhand, is the sole occasion where Sohrai paintings are displayed publicly.
3. The distinctive style of Sohrai painting, characterized by its depictions of animals and birds, is a reflection of the region's predominantly pastoral lifestyle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sohrai painting is indeed a folk art form primarily practiced by tribal women in Jharkhand, and it characteristically employs natural earth pigments. These pigments are either gathered directly from the environment or purchased from local vendors. The use of natural materials is a key element of the tradition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Sohrai paintings are prominently featured during the Sohrai festival, this is not the only occasion on which they are displayed or celebrated.  The paintings hold cultural significance beyond a single festival, often adorning homes and representing important life events within the community throughout the year.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  The depiction of animals and birds in Sohrai paintings does reflect aspects of the agrarian lifestyle and reverence for wildlife prevalent in tribal culture. However,  the statement oversimplifies the themes. Sohrai paintings encompass a broader range of themes related to the tribal community's beliefs, rituals, and social structures, not solely a pastoral lifestyle.


**2. With reference to Jharkhand's geographical features and resources, consider the following statements:**

1. The Subarnarekha River, originating in Jharkhand, contributes significantly to the state's irrigation network and hydroelectric power generation.
2. Jharkhand's significant bauxite reserves, located primarily in the northern part of the state, are a major contributor to the aluminum industry in India.
3. The Son River, a major tributary of the Ganges, is entirely confined within the boundaries of Jharkhand, playing a crucial role in shaping its topography.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Subarnarekha River does flow through Jharkhand and contributes to the state's resources but the statement that it significantly contributes to irrigation and hydroelectric power generation is an exaggeration. While some irrigation and hydroelectric projects utilize the river's water, its impact in these sectors is not as dominant as other rivers in India.

Statement 2 is correct. Jharkhand holds substantial bauxite reserves, a key raw material for aluminum production. These reserves are indeed a crucial factor in the national aluminum industry. However,  the statement's claim of the reserves being primarily located in the northern part is a simplification.  Bauxite deposits are spread across several regions within Jharkhand.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Son River, while flowing through parts of Jharkhand, also extends into other states. It is not entirely confined within Jharkhand's borders. Its contribution to the state's topography, though significant, is not exclusive.



**3. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, was born in Tankara, Gujarat, and passed away on October 30, 1883.
2.  The Arya Samaj's core tenets, as expounded in Swami Dayanand Saraswati's "Satyarth Prakash," advocate for the rejection of idol worship and the strict adherence to Vedic principles.
3. The Arya Samaj actively promoted social reforms, including widow remarriage and inter-caste marriages, but opposed the practice of donating to priests.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, was indeed born in Tankara, Gujarat, and his death anniversary is observed on October 30th.  The provided date of 1883 is accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, strongly advocated for a return to Vedic principles.  "Satyarth Prakash," a key text of the Arya Samaj, explicitly rejects idol worship and emphasizes the authority of the Vedas as the sole source of religious truth.

Statement 3 is correct. The Arya Samaj played a significant role in promoting social reform in India. It championed the causes of widow remarriage and inter-caste marriages, challenging traditional social hierarchies.  Furthermore,  the Arya Samaj was critical of the practice of donating to priests, advocating for direct engagement with religious texts rather than intermediary figures.


**4. With reference to the Kumbh Mela, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kumbh Mela, held once every 12 years, rotates among four locations: Haridwar, Ujjain, Nashik, and Prayagraj, each situated on the banks of a sacred river.
2.  Pilgrims participate in the Kumbh Mela primarily to bathe in sacred rivers, believing this act purifies them of their sins and promotes spiritual liberation.  The Kumbh Mela is exclusively a Hindu religious event.
3.  The Kumbh Mela's significance has been acknowledged globally, with UNESCO recognizing it as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. The Mela lasts for 45 days.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Kumbh Mela does rotate among four locations: Haridwar, Ujjain, Nashik, and Prayagraj. However,  the claim that each location is situated on the banks of a *single* sacred river is not entirely accurate. Prayagraj, for instance, is at the confluence of three rivers (Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati).  The frequency of 12 years is also correct for the *Maha Kumbh Mela*.  The Ardh Kumbh Mela is held every six years.


Statement 2 is correct. The central ritualistic practice of the Kumbh Mela involves bathing in sacred rivers.  The belief in the purifying and spiritually liberating power of these waters is fundamental to the Mela's religious significance.  It is indeed predominantly a Hindu religious event.

Statement 3 is partially correct. UNESCO has indeed recognized the Kumbh Mela as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. However, its duration is not always 45 days. The duration varies depending on the location and the specific year.  The Maha Kumbh Mela generally lasts longer than an Ardh Kumbh Mela.


**5. With reference to Sohrai Painting, consider the following statements:**

1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted a Sohrai painting to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a BRICS summit held in Kazan, Russia.
2. Sohrai painting, a tribal art form from Jharkhand's Hazaribagh area, is characterized by its expressive storytelling, primarily depicting scenes from daily life and agricultural practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Narendra Modi did gift a Sohrai painting to Vladimir Putin during a BRICS summit.  While the exact location of the summit in the prompt is not specified, a BRICS summit has indeed taken place in Kazan, Russia.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Sohrai paintings do feature scenes from daily life, the primary focus is not solely on agricultural practices.  The paintings incorporate elements of storytelling, depicting animals, birds, and nature, reflecting a broader cultural and spiritual worldview of the tribal community.

Statement 3 is correct. The transmission of Sohrai painting techniques from mothers to daughters is a crucial aspect of its continuity, reinforcing the matriarchal structure within the tribal communities where the art form is practiced.


**6.  With reference to the Raigad Fort, consider the following statements:**

1.  Located atop a steep hill in Raigad district, Maharashtra, the Raigad Fort served as a key military stronghold for the Maratha Empire.
2. British historians referred to the Raigad Fort as the "Gibraltar of the East," highlighting its strategic location and formidable defensive fortifications, comparable to the Rock of Gibraltar.
3. The Raigad Fort's historical significance is primarily associated with its role as the coronation site for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha Empire, and its use as the Maratha capital for a short period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

Statement 3 is correct. The Raigad Fort holds significant historical importance as the coronation site of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and served as a capital of the Maratha Empire for a period of time.  This event significantly shaped the fort's place in Maratha history and Indian history.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the legal framework concerning historical artifacts in India:**

1. The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878, primarily deals with the discovery and ownership of hidden or buried treasure.
2. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, focuses solely on the preservation of ancient Buddhist monasteries.
3. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947, prohibits the export of all antiques regardless of their historical significance or origin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878, outlines the legal procedures for discovering, reporting, and claiming ownership of hidden or buried treasure.  It details the rights of finders and the government's role in the process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, is broader than just Buddhist monasteries.  It aims to protect and preserve all ancient monuments and archaeological sites of national importance, encompassing various historical periods and religious structures.  The focus is on preservation, not solely on a specific religious architecture.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947, doesn't prohibit the export of *all* antiques.  It regulates the export of specified antiquities deemed to be of historical or archaeological importance, requiring permits and approvals before their export.  The criteria for what constitutes an "antiquity" subject to control are defined within the Act itself.  Many antiques may not fall under these specified categories and are therefore not subject to export restrictions.  The act aims to prevent the illicit removal of significant cultural heritage from India.


**2. With reference to the legal provisions concerning cultural heritage in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act, 1951, allows for the private ownership of nationally important archaeological sites.
2. The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, exclusively deals with the regulation of the art market within India.
3. The Public Records Act, 1993, is primarily concerned with the preservation and management of government documents and archives, not necessarily private historical documents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1951 Act declares certain monuments and sites as nationally important, bringing them under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India.  Private ownership of these declared sites is generally not permitted, as they are considered national heritage.  The act focuses on the protection and preservation of these sites for public benefit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, regulates the trade in antiquities and art treasures, its scope extends beyond just the domestic art market. It also deals with the import and export of such items and aims to prevent illegal trafficking.  The act seeks to preserve and protect India's cultural heritage by controlling the trade in such valuable artifacts.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Public Records Act, 1993, establishes a framework for the management and preservation of public records held by government agencies.  While it contributes to the preservation of historical information, its primary focus is on government documents and their long-term accessibility and integrity.  The act does not directly address private historical documents unless they have been legally transferred to public archives.


**3. With reference to the Constitution of India and its implications for state finances, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly mandates that the Central Government must provide a minimum 50% share of the total budget to state governments annually.
2.  The Constitution of India outlines a detailed procedure for the distribution of funds between the Central and State governments based on the population of each state.
3. The Constitution mandates State Government loan consent for all inter-state financial transactions to prevent uncontrolled lending.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't mandate a specific percentage of the central budget for state governments. The distribution of funds between the Centre and States is governed by various provisions, including Articles 265, 268, 270, and others, but there’s no fixed 50% mandate.  The distribution is a complex process influenced by various factors, including the Finance Commission's recommendations and the nature of the spending.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the population is a factor considered by the Finance Commission in recommending the distribution of resources, it's not the sole criterion.  The Finance Commission assesses various factors, including population, tax revenue, state's financial needs, and other economic indicators, to recommend a fair and equitable distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and States.  The population is one among many parameters considered, and the formula is subject to periodic reviews and amendments.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't specifically mandate State Government loan consent for *all* inter-state financial transactions.  While there are provisions related to borrowing and financial relations between the Centre and States, the requirement of state consent varies depending on the nature of the transaction and the relevant legislation. The constitution mainly focuses on the distribution of tax revenue and general framework of financial relations, not detailed control over all such transactions.


**4. With reference to the Indian judicial system as defined in the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India explicitly lists the exact number of judges who must serve on each High Court.
2.  The Constitution mandates that all High Courts must have a minimum of 25 judges irrespective of the state's population or caseload.
3.  The Constitution explicitly details the procedure for the appointment of judges to the High Courts but not the specific words of the oath.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't specify the exact number of judges for each High Court. The number of judges is determined based on the workload and the needs of the specific state, subject to Parliament's approval.  The number is not static and can vary over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't mandate a minimum number of 25 judges for all High Courts.  The number of judges varies based on the state's size, population, and caseload.  The constitution has a general framework for the establishment and governance of the High Courts, not any fixed number of judges.

Statement 3 is correct. The Constitution outlines the process for appointing High Court judges (Article 217), involving consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor. However, the precise wording of the oath isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution; it's left to the specific procedures established through other legislation. The constitution provides the broad framework, leaving the specifics to other regulations and legislative enactments.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Seventh Schedule exclusively deals with the distribution of subjects between the Union and the States, excluding any concurrent subjects.
2.  The Seventh Schedule lists the subjects that are to be solely administered by the Union government, excluding the powers of the states.
3. The Seventh Schedule provides a comprehensive and immutable list of subjects, preventing any future addition or deletion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule divides legislative powers among three lists: Union List (subjects exclusively for the Union Government), State List (subjects for state governments), and Concurrent List (subjects on which both Union and State Governments can legislate).  The schedule is not limited to only the distribution between union and states, it also includes concurrent subjects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union List in the Seventh Schedule enumerates subjects under the exclusive purview of the Union Government; however, the State List also specifies the subjects that are exclusively under the power of the State governments. The schedule is not only about the power of the Union government; it also includes powers that are vested in the states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule is not immutable.  Constitutional amendments can add, delete, or modify entries in the lists.  The lists have been amended multiple times since the adoption of the Constitution, reflecting the evolving nature of governance and legislative priorities.  The schedule is not rigid; it has been flexible and adaptable to changes over time.


**6. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC's Chairperson and Members are appointed by the Chief Justice of India, ensuring judicial independence in its operations.
2. The NHRC has the power to investigate human rights violations committed by private individuals, but not by the government.
3.  The NHRC can only issue recommendations, lacking the power to impose any penalties for human rights violations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairperson and Members of the NHRC are appointed by the President of India, not the Chief Justice of India, on the recommendation of a committee. While judicial independence is important, the appointment process involves other significant stakeholders in the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC can investigate human rights violations committed by both private individuals and government entities (including state agencies), though its powers to investigate certain actions by the armed forces are limited. The NHRC’s mandate covers a broad range of human rights violations, including those committed by state agencies and private individuals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NHRC primarily issues recommendations, it has certain powers similar to a civil court, allowing it to summon witnesses, collect evidence, and even seek the enforcement of its recommendations.  The NHRC lacks the power to directly punish, but it can utilize its powers to make its recommendations effective.  Its recommendations carry significant moral authority and can influence government action.


**7.  Consider the following statements about the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):**

1. The NCSC Chairperson and Members are appointed by the President of India for a term of five years.
2.  The NCSC has the power to investigate complaints related to atrocities against Scheduled Castes, but not Scheduled Tribes.
3. The NCSC's recommendations are binding on the Central and State Governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairperson and Members of the NCSC are appointed by the President of India, but their term is three years, not five years.  The constitution defines the appointment process and the tenure of the commission members.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCSC's mandate extends to investigating complaints related to atrocities against both Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  Its role is to protect and promote the rights of both these groups.  The constitution has a comprehensive framework for the protection of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCSC's recommendations are not legally binding on the Central and State Governments.  However, they carry significant weight and influence, and governments are generally expected to consider them seriously.  The commission's recommendations have moral weight and can influence policy decisions.  It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the rights of scheduled castes are protected.



**8. With reference to the Chief Justice of India (CJI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CJI is appointed by the Parliament of India through a simple majority vote.
2. The CJI can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament.
3. The CJI is the head of the Supreme Court of India and the head of the entire judicial system in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CJI is appointed by the President of India, not the Parliament.  The appointment process involves consultation with the outgoing CJI and other senior judges, but the ultimate decision rests with the President.  The constitution clearly outlines the procedure for appointing the Chief Justice of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While impeachment is a method of removal, it is not the only way.  The CJI can also be removed on grounds of proved misbehavior or incapacity through a process involving the President and the Supreme Court.  The constitution has multiple provisions for the removal of the Chief Justice of India.

Statement 3 is correct. The CJI is indeed the head of the Supreme Court of India and is considered the head of the entire judicial system in the country.  The CJI plays a vital role in the administration of justice and the functioning of the judicial system in India.  The constitution grants the Chief Justice of India multiple roles and powers.


**9. With reference to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDMA is headed by the President of India, who is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
2. The NDMA was established in 2005 primarily in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
3. The NDMA has the power to deploy the army in disaster relief operations without any prior government approval.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDMA is headed by the Prime Minister of India, not the President. The Prime Minister's role reflects the executive leadership needed in disaster response.

Statement 2 is correct. The NDMA's establishment in 2005 through the Disaster Management Act was a direct consequence of the devastating impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, highlighting the need for a centralized and coordinated national response mechanism.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NDMA coordinates disaster relief efforts and can recommend the deployment of the armed forces, it doesn't have the unilateral power to deploy the army without government approval.  The deployment of armed forces is a matter of national security policy and requires the approval of the government, which the NDMA has to seek.  The NDMA has a coordinating role, not a direct command over the armed forces.


**10. With reference to 'Arbitration and Conciliation', consider the following statements:**

1.  Conciliation is a binding process where a third party imposes a solution on disputing parties.
2. Arbitration is a non-binding process, allowing parties to reject the arbitrator's decision.
3.  Both arbitration and conciliation aim to resolve disputes outside of traditional court proceedings.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Conciliation is a non-binding process where a neutral third party helps the disputing parties reach a mutually acceptable agreement.  The conciliator facilitates communication and negotiation, but they do not impose a decision.  The process is voluntary and depends on the parties’ willingness to reach an agreement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Arbitration is a binding process where a neutral third party (arbitrator) hears evidence and makes a decision that is legally binding on the parties involved.  The arbitrator's decision is enforceable through the courts.  The arbitration process is intended to be legally binding, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

Statement 3 is correct. Both arbitration and conciliation are forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), providing mechanisms to resolve disputes outside the formal court system, offering more efficient and flexible methods of dispute settlement.  Both processes aim to reduce the burden on the traditional court system.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Representation of the People Act, 1950:**

1.  The Act exclusively governs the conduct of elections to the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Act outlines the qualifications for voters but not for candidates contesting elections.
3.  The Act mandates the preparation and maintenance of electoral rolls at the national level only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Representation of the People Act, 1950, is a crucial piece of legislation that deals with various aspects of the electoral process in India.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Act's scope extends beyond Lok Sabha elections; it also governs elections to State Legislative Assemblies and Legislative Councils. Statement 2 is also incorrect as the Act comprehensively covers both voter qualifications and the eligibility criteria for candidates.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the Act provides for the maintenance of electoral rolls at both national and state levels, ensuring a comprehensive and consistent electoral register across the country. The Act's provisions are fundamental to the functioning of India's democratic system, ensuring free and fair elections.  It is a cornerstone of India's electoral framework and is essential for understanding the mechanics of representation in the Indian Parliament and State Legislatures.


**2. With reference to the Representation of the People Act, 1951, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act empowers the Election Commission to recognize only national parties, not regional parties.
2.  The Act primarily deals with the disqualification of elected members based on criminal convictions alone.
3.  The Act prescribes the procedure for the counting of votes but does not regulate the scrutiny of nominations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Representation of the People Act, 1951, complements the 1950 Act by addressing the conduct of elections and related matters. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Act empowers the Election Commission to recognize both national and regional political parties based on predefined criteria.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the Act defines grounds for disqualification of elected members which extend beyond criminal convictions.  These grounds include factors such as holding an office of profit and violating the anti-defection law.  Statement 3 is also incorrect, as the Act details the procedures for both nomination scrutiny and vote counting, ensuring the integrity and transparency of the electoral process.  The 1951 Act is critical to the smooth and fair conduct of elections and the maintenance of a robust democratic system. It lays down the framework for the Election Commission's role in regulating political parties and ensuring compliance with electoral laws.


**3. With reference to the Election Commission of India (ECI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ECI is solely responsible for conducting elections to the President and Vice-President of India.
2.  The ECI's decisions on election-related disputes are not subject to judicial review.
3.  The ECI's power to recognize political parties and allot symbols is derived from the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India is an independent constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while the ECI conducts elections for the President and Vice-President, it does so in accordance with the prescribed constitutional procedures.  Other bodies, such as the Electoral College, also play a vital role in these elections. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court has the power to review the ECI's decisions in election-related disputes, thereby maintaining a balance between the ECI's autonomy and judicial oversight.  Statement 3 is correct; the ECI's authority to recognize political parties and allocate symbols is explicitly granted under the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968. This Order provides the legal framework for the ECI to manage the symbol allocation process and resolve disputes among political parties.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP):**

1.  The DPSPs are justiciable, meaning they can be directly enforced in courts of law.
2.  Article 47 of the Constitution, which is part of the DPSP, mandates the prohibition of intoxicating drinks and drugs.
3.  The DPSPs are primarily aimed at achieving social and economic justice, complementing the Fundamental Rights.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy are a set of guidelines for the state to follow in formulating policies. Statement 1 is incorrect.  DPSPs are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts.  They serve as guiding principles for the government's actions, aiming to create a just and equitable society. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Article 47 aims to improve public health by raising the nutrition level and standard of living, it doesn't explicitly mandate a prohibition of intoxicating drinks and drugs. This specific prohibition is addressed elsewhere in the Constitution through other laws and regulations. Statement 3 is correct.  DPSPs aim to build a welfare state by setting social and economic goals for the government. They work in conjunction with Fundamental Rights to ensure a holistic approach to the well-being of citizens.


**5. With reference to the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Cabinet Committee on Security is a crucial decision-making body for matters of national security. Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCS is chaired by the Prime Minister, not the President. The Chief Justice of India is not a member of the CCS. Statement 2 is partially correct. While the CCS does deal with defence expenditure and significant appointments, its purview is broader than just the defence sector.  Statement 3 is correct. The CCS deliberates on a wide range of security-related issues, including national security, internal security, foreign policy (with a focus on security aspects), and even matters related to atomic energy.  The CCS plays a vital role in coordinating and making crucial decisions related to national security.


**6.  With reference to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Backward Classes is a constitutional body responsible for safeguarding the interests of backward classes. Statement 1 is correct. The NCBC was indeed established through the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018, giving it constitutional status.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCBC's recommendations are advisory in nature; the Union Government retains the final authority on the inclusion or exclusion of communities in the list of Backward Classes.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCBC comprises a Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson, and three other members, not five.  The NCBC's role is significant in ensuring that the rights and interests of backward classes are protected and that their socio-economic development is promoted.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the oath-taking ceremony in India:**

1. The Constitution of India specifies the exact wording of the oath for all government offices.
2.  At the state level, the Chief Minister administers the oath to the Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The oath-taking ceremony is a formal process marking the assumption of office. Statement 1 is incorrect because while the Constitution outlines the form of oaths for various offices, it doesn't prescribe the exact wording in all cases. Some variations might exist depending on the specific office.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Governor of a state administers the oath of office to the Chief Minister and other Ministers, not the Chief Minister himself. Statement 3 is correct. The Chief Justice of India administers the oath of office to the President of India, reflecting the importance of the judiciary in upholding the Constitution.  The oath-taking ceremony is a significant constitutional process and is a symbol of the commitment of office-holders to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land.


**8. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The Chairperson of the NHRC is appointed by the Prime Minister.
3. The NHRC possesses the powers of a civil court, and its proceedings are of a judicial character.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Human Rights Commission is a statutory body mandated to protect human rights. Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not a constitutional body.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The President of India appoints the Chairperson of the NHRC based on the recommendations of a six-member committee. The Prime Minister is a member of this committee, but doesn't solely appoint the Chairperson. Statement 3 is correct. The NHRC does possess the powers of a civil court, and its proceedings have a judicial character, enabling it to effectively investigate and address human rights violations. The NHRC plays a vital role in promoting and protecting human rights in India.  Its quasi-judicial powers allow it to investigate complaints and recommend remedial action.


**9. With reference to the appointment of the Chief Justice of India (CJI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India specifies a detailed procedure for the appointment of the CJI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The appointment of the Chief Justice of India is a significant constitutional process. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not explicitly lay down a procedure for appointing the CJI.  The process is largely based on convention and established practices. Statement 2 is incorrect. Seniority in the Supreme Court is determined by the date of appointment to the Supreme Court, not solely by age.  Other factors, such as precedence of oath-taking and years of High Court service, also play a role in determining seniority. Statement 3 is correct. Conventionally, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court is appointed as the CJI, although this is not a legally binding requirement. This convention ensures a smooth transition of leadership within the judiciary.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Standing Committee on Defence scrutinizes the Ministry of Defence's activities. Statement 1 is correct. The Committee is indeed constituted under Rule 331C of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.  Statement 2 is also correct. The Ministry of Defence is under its jurisdiction, allowing the Committee to oversee its functioning and scrutinize its policies and expenditure. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Committee has 31 members, but the distribution is not equal between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. It consists of 21 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha.  The Standing Committee on Defence plays a crucial role in parliamentary oversight of the defence sector.  Its scrutiny of the Ministry of Defence's actions ensures accountability and transparency.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Women is a statutory body dedicated to women's rights. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCW is a statutory body established under the National Commission for Women Act, 1990, not a constitutional body.  Statement 2 is correct.  The NCW indeed reviews the constitutional and legal safeguards for women and recommends legislative measures to improve their status. Statement 3 is incorrect. The President of India appoints the Chairperson of the NCW.  The NCW plays a vital role in advocating for women's rights and ensuring their empowerment.  It acts as a watchdog, monitoring government policies and recommending necessary changes.


**12.  Which of the following correctly describes the three lists mentioned in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution?**

1.  The Union List contains subjects on which only the State Legislatures can legislate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the distribution of legislative powers. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Union List contains subjects on which only the Parliament can legislate.  Statement 2 is correct. The State List contains subjects on which only the State Legislatures can legislate.  Statement 3 is correct. The Concurrent List contains subjects on which both the Parliament and State Legislatures can legislate; however, in case of a conflict, the Union law prevails. This distribution of powers is a fundamental aspect of India's federal structure, aiming to balance the powers of the Union and the States.  The Seventh Schedule is crucial in understanding the scope of legislative authority and the potential for both cooperation and conflict between the Union and State governments.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the President and Prime Minister of India's roles and powers.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President of India:**

1. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India (CJI) based solely on seniority within the Supreme Court.
2.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment extends to all offenses, regardless of the court or law involved.
3. The President is an integral part of Parliament and participates in the legislative process, including the passage of Money Bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seniority is a strong convention, the President's appointment of the CJI is not strictly bound by it and involves consultation. The process relies heavily on established conventions rather than explicit constitutional dictates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's pardon power, though extensive, is limited by Article 72 of the Constitution.  It specifically applies to sentences by court-martial, offenses against Union laws, and death sentences.  It does not extend to all offenses, particularly those under state laws.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The President is the Head of State, not the Head of Government.  While the President is a part of Parliament and performs certain ceremonial legislative functions (e.g., addressing Parliament, assenting to bills), the President primarily acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers and does not directly participate in the legislative process in the same manner as Members of Parliament. The President's role in Money Bills is limited to assent or withholding assent, not active participation in their drafting or passage.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Constitution explicitly lays down a detailed procedure for the appointment of the Prime Minister.
2. The Prime Minister is responsible for the appointment of the Chairperson and Members of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC).
3. The Prime Minister's tenure is defined by a fixed term, irrespective of the confidence enjoyed in the Lok Sabha.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not prescribe a detailed procedure for appointing the Prime Minister.  The President appoints the leader of the party or coalition commanding a majority in the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister. The process is largely conventional.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President of India, not the Prime Minister, appoints the Chairperson and Members of the NCSC.  The Prime Minister may recommend names, but the final appointing authority rests with the President.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Prime Minister holds office during the pleasure of the President.  While a five-year term is usual, the Prime Minister can be dismissed if they lose the confidence of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament).  Therefore, their tenure is not solely determined by a fixed term.


**3. With reference to the powers of the President and Prime Minister of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President possesses the power of absolute veto over any bill passed by Parliament.
2. The Prime Minister, as the head of the government, enjoys absolute power in decision-making within the Council of Ministers.
3. The President appoints the Governor of a state on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President does not possess the power of an absolute veto. The President possesses suspensive and pocket veto powers, meaning they can delay or return a bill to Parliament for reconsideration. However, if Parliament passes the bill again, the President is bound to give assent.  The President's power is not absolute but conditional.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers and has significant influence, they do not enjoy absolute power. Decision-making in the Council of Ministers follows the principle of collective responsibility, implying a degree of consensus and consultation among ministers.

Statement 3 is correct. The President appoints the Governor of a state, but this appointment is made on the advice of the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister's recommendation is binding on the President in this matter.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the President and Prime Minister:**

1.  The President of India can refer a matter to the Supreme Court for its opinion under Article 143 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 143 of the Constitution empowers the President to seek the Supreme Court's opinion on any question of law or fact of public importance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Prime Minister heads the NDMA, but this is a statutory body established under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, not a constitutional provision.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While both the President and Prime Minister enjoy certain immunities from legal action related to their official duties, they are not completely immune from prosecution for personal acts.  The scope of immunity varies and is subject to judicial interpretation.


**5. With reference to the appointment of judges in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India appoints the judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts based solely on the recommendations of the Union Law Minister.
2. The High Court Collegium plays a crucial role in recommending candidates for appointment as High Court judges.
3.  The process of appointing judges to the higher judiciary is fully transparent and open to public scrutiny.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts involves the Collegium system, which comprises the Chief Justice of India and other senior judges. The Union Law Minister's role is limited to providing information and advice, but the final decision rests with the Collegium.

Statement 2 is correct.  The High Court Collegium, consisting of the Chief Justice of the High Court and other senior judges, plays a vital role in recommending candidates for High Court judgeships. Their recommendations are crucial to the appointment process.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the archaeological finds in West Bengal:**

1.  The lost-wax casting technique, also known as the cire perdue method, was employed in the production of bronze sculptures during the formative phase of West Bengal's history.
2.  Archaeological evidence suggests the practice of fractional burial in West Bengal during the formative phase (4th-7th century).
3.  Red and black pottery, a characteristic feature of the late Harappan culture, has been extensively found in West Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The lost-wax process was a significant metalworking technique used in ancient India, including West Bengal, for creating intricate bronze sculptures.  Evidence from this period supports its use in the region. Statement 2 is also correct. Fractional burial, a burial practice where only parts of a body are interred, has been documented in West Bengal's archaeological record from the formative period. This practice often reflects specific cultural beliefs and rituals.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While red and black pottery is indeed found in India, its association with the late Harappan culture is primarily confined to specific regions.  Its presence in West Bengal during that specific period is not as widely documented as in other parts of the subcontinent.  The statement creates a plausible distractor by connecting a well-known pottery style with a region where its presence may be less prominent during that specific historical phase.

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Sundarbans delta in West Bengal is renowned for its substantial mangrove cover. While the precise figure might vary depending on the source and measurement techniques, the statement uses a plausible figure to create a distractor. Statement 2 is also correct; the Ganga River's course undeniably includes West Bengal, significantly shaping its geography and contributing to the fertile deltaic regions. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Kanchenjunga is a significant peak in the Himalayas, but it is not located within West Bengal. The peak is situated primarily in Sikkim and Nepal, creating a distractor by using a well-known and geographically related peak. The question tests the candidate's specific knowledge of the geographical features of West Bengal.


**3. With reference to the socio-cultural aspects of West Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tebhaga movement, a peasant uprising, primarily involved Muslim tenant farmers demanding a larger share of the harvest.
2.  The Durga Puja festival, one of the most significant festivals in West Bengal, is associated with the worship of the goddess Durga and involves elaborate processions and rituals.
3.  The state song of West Bengal, "Banglar Mati Banglar Jal," reflects the state's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tebhaga movement was a significant peasant movement, but it primarily involved sharecroppers (mostly Hindus) demanding two-thirds of the harvest, not primarily Muslim tenant farmers. This statement uses a plausible distractor by introducing a relevant socio-political context with incorrect details about the primary participants. Statement 2 is correct. Durga Puja is indeed a major festival in West Bengal, characterized by elaborate rituals and community celebrations. Statement 3 is also correct. "Banglar Mati Banglar Jal" is indeed the state song of West Bengal, reflecting its cultural identity and landscape.  The question tests knowledge of West Bengal's socio-cultural fabric, including its festivals, songs, and historical movements.


**4. With reference to the political history of West Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  West Bengal's partition from East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) led to a significant influx of Hindu refugees into the state.
2.  The Communist Party of India (Marxist) held power in West Bengal for a considerable period, implementing land reforms and other socialist policies.
3.  During the British Raj, West Bengal witnessed several significant rebellions against the British East India Company, notably the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The partition of India resulted in a massive displacement of people, with a significant number of Hindu refugees seeking shelter in West Bengal. This is a well-documented historical event.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The CPI(M) did indeed govern West Bengal for an extended period, enacting significant land reforms and pursuing socialist policies. Statement 3 is incorrect. While West Bengal was part of the British Raj and experienced unrest, the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 was not primarily centered in West Bengal, but rather in other parts of Northern India. This serves as a plausible distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific location and context of the Sepoy Mutiny.

1.  APY offers a guaranteed minimum pension of ₹5,000 per month after age 60, irrespective of contribution levels.
2.  Subscribers to APY must be between the ages of 18 and 40 years at the time of enrollment.
3.  Individuals with existing PMJDY accounts are eligible for APY enrollment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While APY does provide a guaranteed minimum pension after the age of 60, the amount varies depending on the contribution tier chosen by the subscriber, not a fixed ₹5,000.  The minimum pension amount is guaranteed, but the exact figure depends on the contribution amount.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The age limit for APY subscribers is not strictly 18-40 years. While it's true that the majority of subscribers fall within this age bracket, the scheme is open to individuals aged 18-40 years as of 31 December 2023, and the age limit can be extended based on the government's decision.  The upper age limit is not a rigid constraint.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that individuals with PMJDY accounts are eligible to enroll in APY.  This linkage simplifies the enrollment process for a significant portion of the population.  The availability of PMJDY accounts provides a convenient pathway to access APY benefits.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. PM-SYM provides a minimum guaranteed pension of ₹3,000 per month upon reaching the age of 65.
2.  Participation in PM-SYM is mandatory for all unorganized sector workers in India.
3.  PM-SYM benefits are compatible with the Atal Pension Yojana (APY).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM-SYM scheme provides a minimum guaranteed pension of ₹3,000 per month, but the eligibility age is 60, not 65. This detail is crucial for understanding the scheme's timeline and benefits.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PM-SYM is a *voluntary* contributory pension scheme.  It is not mandatory for all unorganized sector workers; participation is based on individual choice and eligibility criteria.  Mandating participation would raise significant administrative and logistical challenges.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that PM-SYM and APY benefits are compatible.  This means individuals can participate in both schemes simultaneously, potentially maximizing their old-age security provisions.  This compatibility demonstrates a strategic approach to providing comprehensive social security coverage.



**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. PMJVK is exclusively for the benefit of Muslim communities in India.
2.  PMJVK funds are allocated based on a project-by-project basis, with strict adherence to pre-approved proposals.
3.  The PMJVK scheme has been identified by NITI Aayog as a "Core of the Core Scheme" under the National Development Agenda.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMJVK primarily targets minority communities, it explicitly includes Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, and Parsis.  The scheme's scope extends beyond a single religious group.  Restricting it to only one would be discriminatory and against the principles of inclusive development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that the release of funds under PMJVK is no longer tied to individual projects, offering greater flexibility to states in utilizing resources.  This shift from a rigid project-based approach to a more flexible model improves efficiency.

Statement 3 is correct. The provided text clearly states that NITI Aayog has identified PMJVK as a "Core of the Core Scheme" under the National Development Agenda. This classification highlights the scheme's importance in national development priorities.  This designation underscores the scheme's significance within the broader framework of national policy.



**4. With reference to the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGMSE), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CGMSE covers agricultural activities and Self Help Groups (SHGs).
2. The CGMSE provides guarantee coverage for credit facilities up to ₹100 crore per eligible borrower.
3. The CGMSE is implemented by the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CGMSE explicitly excludes agricultural activities and SHGs from its coverage. This exclusion reflects the scheme's focus on specific sectors within the MSME landscape. Including these would greatly expand the scheme's scope and financial burden.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CGMSE provides guarantee coverage for credit facilities up to ₹500 lakh (₹5 crore), not ₹100 crore, per eligible borrower. This limit is essential for understanding the scheme's financial reach and potential impact.  A higher limit would require significantly more resources.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly indicates that the CGTMSE is the implementing authority for the CGMSE.  This clarifies the administrative structure and accountability of the scheme.  The CGTMSE's role is central to the scheme's successful execution.


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding Viability Gap Funding (VGF):**

1.  VGF is primarily used to fund infrastructure projects in the renewable energy sector.
2.  The Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-UDAN utilizes VGF to incentivize airlines.
3.  Under the UDAN scheme, the central government bears 100% of the VGF cost.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While VGF can be used for renewable energy projects, its application is broader, encompassing various infrastructure development initiatives, including transportation and other public services.  Restricting it solely to renewable energy overlooks its diverse applications.

Statement 2 is correct. The UDAN scheme explicitly utilizes VGF to incentivize airlines to operate on underserved routes, promoting regional connectivity. This is a core component of the UDAN strategy.  Without VGF, many routes would remain economically unviable for airlines.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The central government shares 80% of the VGF cost under the UDAN scheme; the remaining 20% is typically shared by state governments, although this percentage can vary depending on the region.  This shared responsibility ensures better coordination and commitment from both levels of government.


**6. With reference to NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog was established by an amendment to the Constitution of India.
2. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission.
3. The Prime Minister of India is the Chairperson of NITI Aayog.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NITI Aayog was not established by a constitutional amendment. It was formed by a resolution of the Union Cabinet, not through a change to the fundamental law of the land.  This reflects the government's flexibility in creating policy institutions.

Statement 2 is correct. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, marking a significant shift in India's approach to economic planning and development.  This transition aimed at creating a more cooperative federalism model.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Prime Minister of India serves as the Chairperson of NITI Aayog, underscoring its position within the highest levels of the government.  This reflects the importance of NITI Aayog's role in national policy.


**7. With reference to the Ministry of Home Affairs, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for the administration of all states in India.
2. The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) operate under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
3.  The Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for the implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for the administration of Union Territories, not states. States have their own administrative structures and governments.  Confusing the two would demonstrate a lack of understanding of India's federal structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) are under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This reflects the ministry's role in maintaining internal security.  The CAPF's diverse functions require strong central coordination.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) falls under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Attributing it to the Ministry of Home Affairs reveals a misunderstanding of the relevant ministries' responsibilities.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY):**

1. MeitY launched the BharatNet project.
2. MeitY is responsible for regulating Google's operations in India.
3. The Digital India Programme is implemented solely by MeitY.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While MeitY plays a significant role in the digital infrastructure development that underpins BharatNet, the Ministry of Communications is the primary agency responsible for its implementation.  Attributing it to MeitY would be an oversimplification of the project's governance.

Statement 2 is correct. MeitY plays a crucial role in regulating the operations of technology companies like Google within India's digital ecosystem.  This regulatory function is crucial for ensuring responsible technological development and protecting consumer interests.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Digital India Programme involves collaboration between multiple ministries and agencies. While MeitY plays a central role, it is not the sole implementing body.  This collaborative approach leverages diverse expertise and resources for effective program execution.



**9. With reference to the Ministry of Education, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Career Service (NCS) portal is managed by the Ministry of Education.
2. The Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan is administered by the Ministry of Education.
3. The Ministry of Education launched the PM Vishwakarma Scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Career Service (NCS) portal falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Education.  The NCS focuses on employment-related services, a different domain from educational policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan, a comprehensive education program, is under the Ministry of Education's purview.  This reflects the ministry's responsibility for managing education initiatives across different levels.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PM Vishwakarma Scheme was launched by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, not the Ministry of Education.  The PM Vishwakarma Scheme aims to support traditional artisans and craftspeople, falling outside the Ministry of Education's primary mandate.


**10. Consider the following statements about government schemes:**

1. The Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) provides benefits only to new employees earning above ₹15,000 per month.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is implemented by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.
3.  The National Food Security Act (NFSA) aims to provide subsidized food grains to eligible households.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ABRY provides benefits to new employees earning *less* than ₹15,000 per month. This eligibility criterion targets a specific segment of the workforce.  A higher income threshold would exclude many of the intended beneficiaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PMMSY is implemented by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, not the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.  This distinction highlights the sectoral focus of the different ministries.

Statement 3 is correct. The NFSA's primary objective is to ensure food security for eligible households by providing subsidized food grains.  This is a fundamental aspect of India's social safety net.  The scheme's effectiveness is crucial for poverty reduction.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Health Mission, implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, primarily focuses on improving maternal and child health indicators.
2.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, notified by the Ministry, aim to regulate commercial surrogacy practices completely.
3. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is solely responsible for the implementation of all aspects of Ayushman Bharat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the National Health Mission (NHM) encompasses a broader range of health objectives, improving maternal and child health is a core component.  The NHM seeks to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates, improve nutrition, and enhance access to healthcare services for mothers and children.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, aim to regulate surrogacy,  the statement that they aim to completely regulate *commercial* surrogacy practices is an oversimplification. The rules aim to prevent exploitation but may not completely eliminate all forms of commercial activity in the sector. Nuances and interpretations exist.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Although the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the primary body responsible for Ayushman Bharat,  its implementation involves collaboration with various state governments, private hospitals, and other stakeholders.  The Ministry does not manage all aspects solely.


**2. With reference to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's regulatory actions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry's approval of the BPaLM regimen signifies a significant advancement in treating tuberculosis.
2. The Ministry manages the exclusive distribution of Albendazole tablets throughout India, leaving no room for private sector involvement.
3. The National Action Plan on Heat Related Illness (NAP-HRI), released by the Ministry, focuses entirely on preventive measures and excludes treatment protocols.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The approval of a new treatment regimen (BPaLM in this case) for a major disease like tuberculosis represents a significant step forward in public health.  This indicates a commitment to improving treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ministry plays a crucial role in the distribution of Albendazole tablets (often for deworming programs), it's inaccurate to claim it *exclusively* manages distribution, eliminating private sector participation altogether.  Private entities might also distribute Albendazole, though possibly under regulatory guidelines or in collaboration with the Ministry.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  A comprehensive National Action Plan on Heat Related Illness (NAP-HRI) would likely include both preventive measures (awareness campaigns, heat-action plans) *and* treatment protocols for heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.  It's unlikely to focus solely on prevention.


**3. With reference to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's policies and programs, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry's promotion of generic medicines is primarily aimed at reducing healthcare costs for the wealthy.
2. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) operates independently of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
3. The Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme, implemented by the Ministry, focuses exclusively on improving the literacy rates of girls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ministry's promotion of generic medicines is primarily aimed at making essential medicines more affordable and accessible to the *general population*, particularly those from lower socioeconomic strata. While the wealthy might indirectly benefit, the primary goal is to address affordability for the underprivileged.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FSSAI, while having its own operational autonomy, functions *under* the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  It is a subordinate organization.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The BBBP scheme aims to address the issue of gender inequality and female foeticide. While improving literacy rates is a component, the scheme's focus is broader, encompassing the overall empowerment and well-being of girls.


**4.  With reference to the Atal Pension Yojana (APY), consider the following statements:**

1. The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) provides a guaranteed pension of Rs. 5,000 per month to all subscribers after age 60.
2.  Subscribers to the APY can also be income taxpayers.
3. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) solely manages all aspects of the APY without any involvement from other government bodies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The APY offers a guaranteed minimum pension, but the amount varies (Rs. 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000) depending on the subscriber's contribution level. It does not guarantee Rs. 5000 for all.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A key eligibility criterion for APY is that subscribers should *not* be income taxpayers.  This scheme is targeted towards the unorganized sector workers and others not covered by other pension schemes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the PFRDA plays a central role in administering the APY, other government bodies and agencies are also involved in its implementation and oversight.  It's not a solely PFRDA-managed scheme.



**5. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1. The PMMY loan limit has been increased to ₹50 lakh for all categories of borrowers.
2.  The PMMY exclusively targets individuals and excludes partnerships or companies.
3. The 'Shishu' category under PMMY covers loans exceeding ₹5 lakh.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The loan limit under PMMY has been increased, but not to ₹50 lakh for all categories. The increase is to ₹20 lakh, specifically for a new "Tarun Plus" category.  The limits for other categories remain lower.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PMMY aims to support micro and small enterprises, which can include partnerships and small companies, not just individuals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 'Shishu' category under PMMY covers loans up to ₹50,000, not exceeding it.  Higher loan amounts fall under the 'Kishore' and 'Tarun' categories.


These five questions demonstrate the application of the prompt's instructions, offering challenging and nuanced MCQs on the provided topic.  The explanations provide sufficient detail to justify the answers and highlight potential distractors.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions on the East Asia Summit (EAS), incorporating the provided target content and adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is assessed as indicated.


**1. Consider the following statements about the East Asia Summit (EAS):**

1. The EAS was established in 1997 following the ASEAN Plus Three Summit.
2.  The first EAS summit was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and included all ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, South Korea, and India.
3.  The EAS exclusively focuses on economic cooperation among its member states, excluding security or political discussions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only  (b) 2 only  (c) 1 and 2 only  (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the EAS's origins can be traced back to earlier proposals for an East Asian Economic Grouping (EAEG) and discussions within the ASEAN Plus Three framework, the East Asia Summit itself was formally established in 2005, not 1997. The 1997 ASEAN Plus Three summit was a significant precursor, but it did not establish the EAS.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The first EAS summit *was* held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2005. However, the initial membership did not include all ASEAN members plus only China, Japan, South Korea, and India.  All ten ASEAN members were included from the outset, along with other major powers.  The statement misrepresents the initial composition of the summit.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The EAS is a broad-based forum that addresses a wide range of political, security, and economic issues.  While economic cooperation is a key component, it is not the exclusive focus; strategic and political matters are also central to the EAS agenda.  The emphasis on solely economic cooperation is a significant oversimplification.  Therefore, only statement 2 contains a partially correct element, making (b) the appropriate answer.



**2. With reference to the East Asia Summit (EAS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister of India's attendance at the EAS summit signifies India's commitment to the ASEAN Plus Six framework.
2.  The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is a constituent organization of the EAS, providing a platform for security dialogue.
3. The India-ASEAN Free Trade Area (FTA) agreement was a key outcome of the inaugural EAS summit in 2005.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's participation in the EAS demonstrates its commitment to regional cooperation in East Asia, it's not specifically linked to the "ASEAN Plus Six" framework.  The EAS includes ASEAN members plus other dialogue partners, but the Plus Six terminology doesn't precisely define the EAS structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ARF is a separate regional security forum in Asia, but it is not a constituent part of the EAS.  The EAS and ARF are distinct organizations, though they both contribute to regional security architecture in East Asia.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The India-ASEAN FTA was signed considerably before the establishment of the EAS, and therefore, it was not an outcome of the inaugural EAS summit in 2005.  The FTA is a separate bilateral agreement, pre-dating the EAS.


**3. With reference to India's engagement with ASEAN, consider the following statements:**

1. India is a founding member of ASEAN, playing a crucial role in its establishment in 1967.
2.  India's 'Act East' policy prioritizes strong economic and strategic ties with ASEAN, aiming for a comprehensive strategic partnership.
3. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) came into effect in 2002, significantly boosting bilateral trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is not a founding member of ASEAN.  The ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) of 1967 was signed by five Southeast Asian nations; India's formal engagement with ASEAN began much later.

Statement 2 is correct. India's 'Act East' policy is a key component of its foreign policy, explicitly focusing on strengthening partnerships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, with ASEAN central to this strategy.  The aim for a comprehensive strategic partnership is a stated goal.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The ATIGA entered into force in 2009, not 2002.  The statement incorrectly places the date of the agreement's implementation.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.



**4.  With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO was established in 2001, initially comprising the "Shanghai Five" members plus Uzbekistan.
2.  The SCO's primary focus is on economic cooperation, with security issues playing a secondary role.
3.  The SCO Charter, signed in 2002, came into force in 2003, outlining the organization's structure and goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 3 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The SCO evolved from the "Shanghai Five" (China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan), and Uzbekistan joined in 2001, leading to the renaming and expansion of the organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While economic cooperation is part of the SCO's mandate,  security and counter-terrorism are core components of its goals and activities.  The statement misrepresents the relative importance of economic and security aspects within the SCO.

Statement 3 is correct. The SCO Charter, signed in 2002, did indeed come into force in 2003, formalizing the organization's framework and objectives.


**5. With reference to the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ESSI is a German-led initiative to create a unified air and missile defence system for Europe, involving both NATO and non-NATO members.
2. The ESSI focuses exclusively on short-range air defence systems, such as the Iron Dome.
3.  The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defence system is a key component of the ESSI's planned architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ESSI is indeed a German-led initiative aiming for a pan-European air and missile defence system, open to both NATO and non-NATO member states.  The description accurately reflects the initiative's scope and inclusivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ESSI's scope extends beyond short-range systems; it aims for an integrated multi-layered defence system encompassing various ranges and capabilities.  The statement wrongly limits the initiative's focus.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Aegis system *could* potentially be incorporated into a broader European air and missile defense system, it's not explicitly confirmed as a core component of the ESSI's plans.  The mention of Aegis is speculative and not based on confirmed plans.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**6. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITU was founded in 1865 as the International Telegraph Union.
2.  The ITU allocates global radio frequencies and satellite orbits, aiming to enhance global access to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).
3. The ITU is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and operates under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ITU's origins trace back to 1865 when it was founded as the International Telegraph Union. This accurately reflects its historical development.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core function of the ITU is indeed the allocation of global radio spectrum and satellite orbits to facilitate the growth and accessibility of ICTs. This is a key and well-known aspect of the ITU's mandate.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The ITU is a specialized agency of the United Nations, not the WTO.  It operates independently of the WTO.  The statement incorrectly identifies its governing body. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



**7. With reference to the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, consider the following statements:**

1. The Five Eyes alliance includes the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.
2.  Germany is a member of the Five Eyes alliance, contributing to intelligence sharing.
3.  The Five Eyes alliance operates under the direct authority of the United Nations, focusing exclusively on counter-terrorism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only (b) 1 and 2 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Five Eyes alliance consists of the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.  This is a well-known and established fact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Germany is not a member of the Five Eyes alliance.  The alliance comprises only the five original English-speaking nations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Five Eyes alliance is not under the authority of the United Nations and its focus is broader than counter-terrorism; it encompasses a wide range of intelligence gathering and sharing activities.  The statement misrepresents both its governance and its mandate.  Only statement 1 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), consider the following statements:**

1.  ASEAN was established in 1967 with the signing of the Bangkok Declaration by Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
2.  India is a founding member of ASEAN.
3.  The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), launched in 2015, focuses exclusively on free trade and investment among its member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 2 only (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The founding of ASEAN in 1967 with the five original member states is accurately described.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India is not a founding member of ASEAN.  India's formal engagement with ASEAN started much later.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The AEC, while focused on economic integration, also addresses issues related to infrastructure, connectivity, and other economic sectors beyond simple free trade.  The statement is an oversimplification.  Only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**9. With reference to the BRICS group, consider the following statements:**

1.  BRICS was conceived in 2001 in a Goldman Sachs report as a grouping of the fastest-growing developing economies not in the G7.
2.  South Africa joined BRICS in 2006.
3. The New Development Bank (NDB), a major BRICS initiative, is headquartered in Brasilia, Brazil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 1 and 2 only (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The origins of BRICS are accurately described in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. South Africa joined BRICS in 2010, not 2006.  The statement provides an incorrect date for South Africa's admission.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NDB is headquartered in Shanghai, China, not Brasilia, Brazil.  The statement incorrectly identifies the NDB's location.  Only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**10. With reference to the Katchatheevu Island, consider the following statements:**

1. Katchatheevu is an uninhabited island located in the Palk Strait, between India and Sri Lanka.

**1. Consider the following statements about the Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972:**

1.  The Schedule I lists only critically endangered species, offering them the highest legal protection in India.
2.  The Red Panda and the Ganges River Dolphin are both listed under Schedule I, reflecting their endangered status.
3.  Species listed under Schedule I are entirely prohibited from trade, with no exceptions allowed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Schedule I provides the highest legal protection, it doesn't exclusively list critically endangered species.  It includes endangered and vulnerable species as well. The level of protection is the highest, encompassing complete prohibition of hunting and trading, but the categorization within the schedule is not solely based on the IUCN's "Critically Endangered" status.


Statement 2 is correct. Both the Red Panda (mentioned in question 9(d)) and the Ganges River Dolphin (question 13) are explicitly stated to be listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.  This highlights the Act's importance in protecting these endangered species.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Schedule I generally prohibits trade, there might be specific, limited exceptions granted under strict conditions and with prior approval from the Central Government. The text mentions this flexibility in the context of the Wildlife (Protection) Licensing (Additional Matters for Consideration) Rules, 2024 (section 4.3.4).  Therefore, a complete prohibition without any possibility of exceptions is not accurate.


**2. With reference to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), consider the following statements:**

1. The NTCA is solely responsible for declaring all Tiger Reserves in India, without any involvement of state governments.
2. The NTCA's approval is mandatory for the establishment of new tiger reserves, as evidenced by Bihar's Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary case.
3. The NTCA's assessment of tiger reserves includes criteria such as prey augmentation, staff capacity building, protection measures, and addressing human-wildlife conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

The text states that the Pandemic Fund Project aims to improve pandemic response capabilities in low- and middle-income countries.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates the Pandemic Fund is a multi-source initiative, not solely funded by the WHO.  Moreover, the amount mentioned is incorrect. The question assesses the candidate's awareness of international initiatives related to worker rights and pandemic preparedness, important aspects of UPSC current affairs and international relations. The inclusion of incorrect funding details and sources adds to the question's difficulty.


**9. With reference to the BRIC economies and the Emissions Gap Report, consider the following statements:**

1.  The term "BRIC" was coined by Amartya Sen in 2001.
2.  The Emissions Gap Report is published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
3.  India aims to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states India's emission reduction target. Statement 1 is incorrect.  Jim O'Neill, not Amartya Sen, coined the term "BRIC."  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Emissions Gap Report is published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), not the IPCC. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of economic terminology and the sources of key environmental reports.  The deliberate inclusion of incorrect names and organizations makes the question more challenging.



**10. With reference to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the FAO's Hand-in-Hand initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The SGPC manages the affairs of Sikh gurdwaras only in India.
2.  The SGPC operates under the Gurdwara Act of 1925.
3.  The FAO's Hand-in-Hand initiative was launched in 2021 to support agrifood systems globally, using advanced geospatial modeling.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The text confirms that the SGPC operates under the Gurdwara Act of 1925. Statement 3 is also correct. The text describes the FAO's Hand-in-Hand initiative and its use of geospatial modeling.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. The SGPC manages Sikh gurdwaras both in India and abroad.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of religious institutions and international development initiatives.  The incorrect statement regarding the SGPC's geographical reach is a key distractor.


**11. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Global MPI compares countries using three dimensions and ten indicators, and is published annually by the World Bank.
2. The GHI is published annually by the World Food Programme and uses a score ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the best possible score.
3. India is a key member of the FAO's Hand-in-Hand initiative, which includes 72 countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The text confirms India's key membership in the FAO's Hand-in-Hand initiative. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Global MPI uses three dimensions and ten indicators, it is published by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The GHI score ranges from 0 to 100, but 0 represents the worst possible score, not the best.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of development indices and their sources, a crucial area for UPSC. The incorrect options contain partially true but ultimately inaccurate details, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO):**

1. The FAO's Global Forest Resource Assessment, published in 2020, exclusively focuses on deforestation rates in the Amazon rainforest.
2.  The FAO's World Food and Agriculture 2024 Statistical Yearbook includes data on agricultural production, trade, and consumption for all member countries, but excludes data on food waste.
3. The FAO collaborates with the World Food Programme (WFP) on initiatives related to food security and nutrition, but not on programs addressing poverty reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is false because the FAO's Global Forest Resource Assessment (GFRA) provides a comprehensive overview of forest resources globally, not just focusing on the Amazon.  While the Amazon is a significant component, the GFRA covers far broader geographical areas and aspects of forest management. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; the FAO's Statistical Yearbook does indeed contain extensive data on agricultural production, trade, and consumption. However, it also includes data on food waste, a key area of FAO concern and research.  Statement 3 is also false because the FAO and WFP have a long-standing and extensive collaboration across various areas, including poverty reduction. Their joint efforts often involve integrated programs that address food security, nutrition, and poverty simultaneously.  The synergistic approach recognizes the interconnectedness of these issues; addressing hunger and malnutrition effectively requires addressing underlying poverty issues.  Therefore, all three statements contain inaccuracies or misleading information.


**2. With reference to the FAO's activities, consider the following statements:**

1. The FAO's Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism (FLRM) primarily focuses on reforestation efforts in developed nations.
2. The FAO Strategy on Climate Change (2022–2031) aims to make agrifood systems more resilient to climate change, but does not consider the role of these systems in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
3. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), jointly established by the FAO and WHO, sets international food safety standards that apply only to processed foods, not fresh produce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false because the FAO's FLRM aims to restore degraded forests and landscapes globally, focusing on both developed and developing countries. The initiative recognizes that restoration is crucial everywhere, including in areas where deforestation pressures may be less intense but where ecosystem services need bolstering. Statement 2 is inaccurate because the FAO’s Strategy on Climate Change explicitly acknowledges the significant contribution of agrifood systems to global greenhouse gas emissions and aims to reduce this contribution through sustainable practices. The strategy integrates climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies within agricultural systems. Statement 3 is also false. The CAC sets international food safety and quality standards that cover a wide range of foods, including fresh produce.  These standards aim to ensure food safety and protect public health globally, covering the entire food chain.


**3. With reference to the United Nations and its agencies, consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) solely relies on mandatory contributions from member states for its funding.
2. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialized agency of the UN, publishes reports only on weather patterns, excluding climate change impacts.
3. The FAO's Action Plan (2022-25) focuses exclusively on adapting agricultural practices to climate change, neglecting mitigation strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false as UNEP's funding significantly relies on voluntary contributions from various sources, including member states, but also private entities and other international organizations. While member states play a crucial role, the funding model is not solely dependent on mandatory contributions. Statement 2 is inaccurate because the WMO publishes a wide array of reports, including those detailing the impacts of climate change on weather patterns, extreme events, and related environmental phenomena.  The organization's role extends beyond simple weather forecasting to encompass climate monitoring, analysis, and the provision of climate-related services. Statement 3 is false; the FAO's Action Plan (2022-25) addresses both climate change adaptation and mitigation within the agricultural sector. The plan recognizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities while simultaneously building resilience to the impacts of climate change.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the relationship between the FAO and other organizations:**

1. The FAO's collaboration with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is limited to projects focused on increasing agricultural yields, disregarding other sustainability aspects.
2. The FAO's support for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is primarily channeled through bilateral agreements with individual countries, excluding multilateral collaborations.
3. The FAO publishes the Food Outlook report, which includes projections of global food prices but does not consider factors like climate change impacts on agricultural production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false because the FAO and IFAD's partnership encompasses a broad range of initiatives promoting sustainable agriculture, including those addressing food security, rural development, and environmental sustainability.  Their collaboration goes beyond simply increasing yields to include improving livelihoods and protecting the environment. Statement 2 is inaccurate as the FAO's support for REDD+ involves significant multilateral collaboration, working with various international organizations, governments, and civil society groups to implement REDD+ programs effectively. The program requires a collaborative approach due to its global scope and complexity. Statement 3 is also false because the Food Outlook report incorporates various factors influencing global food prices, including climatic factors affecting agricultural production, supply chains, and market dynamics.  Climate change impacts are a key consideration in the FAO's food security analysis.


**5. With reference to the FAO and its role in global food security, consider the following statements:**

1. The FAO's definition of food security solely focuses on the availability of sufficient food, ignoring aspects of access, utilization, and stability.
2. The FAO's work on nutrition exclusively targets micronutrient deficiencies, ignoring the broader issue of malnutrition in all its forms.
3. The FAO's initiatives addressing food insecurity are solely focused on increasing food production, neglecting the importance of sustainable agricultural practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false because the FAO's comprehensive definition of food security incorporates four key dimensions: availability, access, utilization, and stability.  These elements are interconnected; food security requires not just enough food but also the ability to access it, utilize it properly (nutritionally), and have consistent access over time. Statement 2 is inaccurate as the FAO addresses malnutrition in its entirety, including undernutrition, overnutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies. Their approach acknowledges the multifaceted nature of malnutrition and addresses various forms through integrated strategies. Statement 3 is false because the FAO strongly emphasizes sustainable agricultural practices as crucial to ensuring long-term food security. Their initiatives promote environmentally friendly methods, resource efficiency, and climate resilience within agriculture, recognizing that unsustainable practices undermine future food production.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and related entities.  Each question includes a detailed explanation and analysis of the correct and incorrect options.  The difficulty level is aimed at "difficult," incorporating plausible distractors and requiring detailed factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) primarily funds projects related to sustainable agriculture implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), focusing on technology transfer and financial aid to developing countries.
2. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) administers the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), a legally binding agreement aimed at conserving and sustainably using plant genetic resources.
3.  The World Food Programme (WFP) and the FAO have a joint program focused on achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), primarily through direct food aid distribution to conflict-affected regions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The FAO plays a crucial role in international agricultural cooperation and is the administering body for the ITPGRFA, a significant treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources. This demonstrates a core function of the FAO in global food security and biodiversity conservation.  The treaty's legally binding nature highlights its importance in international law and agricultural policy.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GEF does partner with the FAO and funds projects related to sustainable agriculture,  its scope extends far beyond solely FAO-implemented projects. The GEF supports a broader range of environmental projects, collaborating with various UN agencies and other organizations.  The statement's emphasis on technology transfer and financial aid is too narrow; the GEF's funding mechanisms are more diverse.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the WFP and FAO collaborate on numerous initiatives related to food security, including efforts to combat hunger (SDG 2),  their joint programs are not limited to direct food aid in conflict zones.  Their collaborations encompass a much wider range of activities, including capacity building, agricultural development, and sustainable food systems. The statement oversimplifies the complexity of their partnership.  The FAO's role is more multifaceted than just food distribution; it focuses on the entire agricultural value chain.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and its activities, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNDP's Human Development Report (HDR) primarily focuses on economic growth metrics such as GDP per capita and inflation rates, providing a comprehensive analysis of national economic performance.
2. The UNDP, in collaboration with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), publishes the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which uses a multi-dimensional approach beyond income poverty to assess poverty levels.
3. The UNDP's primary focus in India is on providing financial assistance directly to individual farmers for improving agricultural productivity through modern technology adoption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The UNDP's collaboration with OPHI in publishing the MPI is a well-established fact.  The MPI is a significant contribution to understanding poverty beyond simple income-based measures, considering factors like health, education, and living standards. This exemplifies the UNDP's commitment to a holistic approach to human development.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNDP's HDR uses a much broader range of indicators than just economic growth metrics to assess human development. While economic factors are considered, the HDR also includes social and environmental dimensions, providing a more nuanced understanding of a country's overall development. The statement's focus solely on economic indicators is a misrepresentation of the report's scope.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The UNDP's work in India is far more extensive than providing direct financial assistance to individual farmers. While agricultural development is a component of their work, it is implemented through various programs and partnerships with national and regional organizations.  The statement's oversimplification of their activities ignores the complexity and scale of the UNDP's development initiatives in India.


**3. With reference to international organizations related to food security and agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Coffee Organization (ICO) is a specialized agency of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), focusing solely on regulating international coffee trade and prices.
2. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) launched the Hand-in-Hand initiative to foster partnerships and investments in food security and poverty reduction, specifically targeting high-income countries for rapid economic growth.
3. The Global Framework on Water Scarcity in Agriculture (WASAG) is a joint initiative of the FAO and the World Bank, focusing on providing financial aid to countries facing water scarcity challenges in agriculture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) None
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.

Statement 1 is incorrect because the ICO is a separate intergovernmental organization, not a sub-organization of the FAO, though they collaborate.  The ICO's focus is on international coffee trade, but it encompasses more than just price regulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the FAO's Hand-in-Hand initiative targets low- and middle-income countries, not high-income countries, to address food security and poverty. Its aim is to leverage partnerships and targeted investments for inclusive growth.

Statement 3 is incorrect. WASAG is a FAO initiative, not a joint venture with the World Bank, designed to support countries in addressing water scarcity challenges in agriculture. It does not primarily involve direct financial aid but rather supports the development of water management strategies.


These examples demonstrate the creation of difficult UPSC-style MCQs that require precise factual knowledge and analytical skills to avoid the misleading distractors.  Remember to consult reliable sources for verifying the factual accuracy of the information used in your questions.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.  I've aimed for a mix of difficulty levels across the questions.


**1. With reference to the World Health Organization (WHO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR) of 1969 mandate the reporting of cholera, leprosy, meningitis, pertussis, plague, tuberculosis, AIDS, and Hepatitis to the WHO for global surveillance.
2.  The WHO certified India as polio-free in 2014, marking a significant milestone in global public health.
3.  Egypt achieved "gold tier" status in the WHO's framework for hepatitis C elimination before 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The IHR (1969) do indeed require reporting of certain diseases to facilitate global surveillance, and the diseases listed are among those included. However, the IHR's scope extends far beyond this specific list.  The statement oversimplifies the IHR's comprehensive nature.

Statement 2 is correct. The WHO did indeed certify India as polio-free.  This is a well-documented achievement reflecting a substantial public health success.

Statement 3 is correct.  Egypt's achievement of "gold tier" status in hepatitis C elimination is a verifiable fact reported by the WHO.


**2. With reference to the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ASI, released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), provides insights into the capital formation in various service sector industries.
2. The 2019 Livestock Census in Maharashtra recorded a higher number of cows under the "indigenous/nondescript" category than the 2012 Census.
3. The ASI provides valuable input to the National Accounts Statistics at both national and state levels.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI focuses on *manufacturing* industries, not the service sector. The question tries to mislead by using a related but incorrect sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2019 Livestock Census in Maharashtra showed a *decrease* in the number of indigenous cows compared to 2012. This is a direct contradiction of the statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The ASI's data is a crucial component of national and state-level economic accounting.


**3. With reference to the discovery of microRNA, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2024 was awarded to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA's role in post-transcriptional gene silencing.
2. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate protein production by binding to and silencing transfer RNA (tRNA).
3.  A recent US study highlighted the role of a specific miRNA, 'let-7', in cancer suppression.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Nobel Prize information is factually accurate and publicly available.

Statement 2 is incorrect. MicroRNAs bind to and silence *messenger RNA (mRNA)*, not tRNA.  The question uses a closely related term to create confusion.

Statement 3 is correct.  The 'let-7' miRNA and its role in cancer are subjects of ongoing research, and studies supporting this claim have been published.


**4. With reference to COVID-19 vaccines developed in India, consider the following statements:**

1. ZyCoV-D is India's first indigenously developed mRNA vaccine.
2. Covaxin is India's first protein subunit vaccine.
3. GEMCOVAC is the world's first and India's indigenously developed mRNA vaccine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ZyCoV-D is a DNA vaccine, not an mRNA vaccine.  The question plays on the similarity between DNA and mRNA vaccines.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Covaxin is an inactivated virus vaccine.  The question uses a related but incorrect vaccine type.

Statement 3 is correct. GEMCOVAC's status as the world's first indigenously developed mRNA vaccine in India is consistent with available information.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the United Nations:**

1. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) established the Blue Line border between Lebanon and Israel.
2. UNESCO is a specialized agency of the United Nations.
3. The UNGA adopted a resolution on promoting "safe, secure, and trustworthy" artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN established the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon which monitors the Blue Line, but the line itself wasn't directly established by the UNGA. The statement attempts to conflate related concepts.

Statement 2 is correct. UNESCO’s status as a specialized UN agency is well-established.

Statement 3 is correct. The UNGA's resolution on AI is a matter of public record.


These questions aim to test not just factual recall but also the ability to analyze information critically and identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.  The distractors are designed to be tempting but ultimately incorrect, pushing the examinee to demonstrate a deep understanding of the topics.

**1. With reference to the Chishti Sufi order, consider the following statements:**

1.  Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the founder of the Chishti order, primarily preached pantheistic monism.
2.  The Chishti order played a significant role in the propagation of the "Piran-e-Pir" concept, emphasizing a lineage of spiritual guides.
3.  Akbar's reign witnessed a decline in the influence of the Chishti order, replaced by the Naqshbandi order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The second statement accurately reflects the historical role of the Chishti order.  The Chishti Sufi order, founded by Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, significantly contributed to popularizing the concept of "Piran-e-Pir," a chain of spiritual masters guiding disciples. This hierarchical structure emphasized the importance of spiritual lineage and guidance within the Sufi tradition.  However, the first statement is inaccurate; while Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti's teachings had a mystical element,  pantheistic monism isn't the most accurate description of his core philosophy.  His emphasis was more on a personal relationship with God and the importance of devotion (Ishq). The third statement is also incorrect. While Akbar did show favor to the Naqshbandi order, the Chishti order remained influential throughout his reign, and its influence didn't simply vanish.  Akbar's religious policies encouraged interaction with various Sufi orders, including the Chishti.


**2. With reference to the Sanchi Stupa, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sanchi Stupa, located in Madhya Pradesh, is primarily known for its intricate ivory sculptures.
2.  The Mauryan dynasty played a crucial role in the initial construction and development of the Sanchi Stupa.
3.  The Sanchi Stupa's current structure is largely a product of the Gupta dynasty's expansion and embellishments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Mauryan emperor Ashoka's patronage of Buddhism is well-documented, and he played a significant role in the construction of the original Sanchi Stupa.  While subsequent dynasties, like the Shungas and Satavahanas, made additions and modifications, the Mauryan period marks the foundation of the monument. The first statement is incorrect; though the Sanchi Stupa contains significant artistic elements, it's more renowned for its impressive architecture, gateways (toranas), and mural paintings, not primarily ivory sculptures.  The third statement is also inaccurate. The Gupta dynasty's artistic contributions were significant, but their major impact wasn't on the Sanchi Stupa. The stupa's primary development occurred during and after the Mauryan period.


**3. With reference to the literary works *Atmakatha* (1946) and *India Divided* (1946), consider the following statements:**

1.  *Atmakatha*, an autobiography, and *India Divided*, an analysis of the partition, were written by Jawaharlal Nehru.
2.  Both books offer insights into the political and social climate of India during the critical period leading up to and immediately following independence.
3.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's perspectives on the partition are extensively documented in *India Divided*.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Both *Atmakatha* and *India Divided* provide valuable historical context surrounding India's independence and partition.  They offer crucial insights into the political and social landscape of the time.  However, the first statement is incorrect; these books were authored by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, India's first President, not Jawaharlal Nehru.  While Nehru also wrote extensively about this period, these specific works are attributed to Prasad. The third statement is also incorrect;  *India Divided* is Dr. Rajendra Prasad's work and doesn't feature Ambedkar's perspectives prominently.  Ambedkar did write extensively about the social and political issues of the time, including the partition, but not in this particular book.


**4. With reference to the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, consider the following statements:**

1. The current white marble dome of the Ajmer Sharif Dargah was constructed during the reign of Akbar.
2. The Ajmer Sharif Dargah is associated with the Chishti Sufi order, founded by Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.
3.  The Khalji rulers of Malwa played a significant role in the early development of the Ajmer Sharif Dargah.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ajmer Sharif Dargah's association with the Chishti order and the Khalji rulers' contributions to its early structure are historically accurate. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti's presence established the Dargah's significance, and the Khalji rulers of Malwa significantly contributed to its construction in the 1460s. However, the first statement is incorrect; the current white marble dome was built during the reign of Humayun, not Akbar.  While Akbar was a contemporary of the Chishti order and showed religious tolerance, he didn't directly commission the dome's construction.


**5. With reference to the Padma Vibhushan awardee,  "Master Moshai," consider the following statements:**

1. The title "Master Moshai" is associated with Raja Ravi Varma, a pioneer of modern Indian art.
2.  Benode Behari Mukherjee’s works were recognized as "art treasures" under the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act of 1972.
3. The Archaeological Survey of India recognized the works of a Padma Vibhushan recipient as 'art treasures' in 1976.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The third statement correctly identifies the key facts. The Archaeological Survey of India's recognition of a Padma Vibhushan recipient's works as 'art treasures' in 1976 under the 1972 Act is accurate. The identity of "Master Moshai" is not explicitly mentioned in the source, but the description points to someone whose works were recognized in this manner.  However, the first statement is incorrect; the title "Master Moshai" is not associated with Raja Ravi Varma.  The second statement is also incorrect; while Benode Behari Mukherjee was a significant artist, the provided information doesn't directly link his work to this specific recognition.


**6. With reference to the Hornbill Festival, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hornbill Festival is celebrated exclusively by the Ao tribe of Nagaland.
2. The festival is held at the heritage village of Kisama.
3.  The Hornbill Festival is named after a species of bird.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Hornbill Festival is indeed held at the Kisama Heritage Village in Nagaland, and its name is derived from the hornbill bird, which holds cultural significance for the Naga tribes.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Hornbill Festival is not exclusive to the Ao tribe but is a celebration of the diverse Naga tribes' cultures in Nagaland.  Many different Naga tribes participate in the festival.


**7. With reference to the Eklingji Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Eklingji Temple is a significant pilgrimage site primarily associated with the Nath sect of Hinduism.
2. The Eklingji Temple served as both a fort and a religious site during the 6th century.
3. The deity of the Eklingji Temple is considered the real ruler of the Mewar kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The third statement accurately reflects the cultural significance of the Eklingji Temple in Mewar. The temple's deity is considered the supreme ruler, with the Mewar kings serving as its representatives.  This reflects the unique blend of religious and political power in the Mewar kingdom.  However, the first statement is inaccurate; while the Eklingji Temple is a significant Hindu pilgrimage site, it's not primarily associated with the Nath sect.  The second statement is also incorrect; the temple's main construction and its significance as an administrative and religious center didn't begin in the 6th century.  Its prominent role in Mewar's history is later.


**8. With reference to the last Governor-General of India, consider the following statements:**

3.  Chakravarti Rajagopalachari held the position of the last Governor-General of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chakravarti Rajagopalachari was indeed the last Governor-General of India.  He was also one of the first recipients of the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.  However, the first statement is incorrect; Jawaharlal Nehru never served as the Governor-General. He became the first Prime Minister of India.  The second statement is partially correct in that C. Rajagopalachari was one of the early recipients of the Bharat Ratna, but the source doesn't state definitively that he was the *first* recipient.  The Bharat Ratna was awarded to C. Rajagopalachari, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and C.V. Raman in 1954.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The second statement is correct; the author of *Swadesa Geethangal*, Subramania Bharati, is indeed widely known as "Mahakavi."  His patriotic poems significantly contributed to the Indian independence movement.  However, the first statement is incorrect; Rabindranath Tagore, while a renowned poet, did not author *Swadesa Geethangal*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Vaikom Satyagraha was a significant movement against the practice of untouchability and caste discrimination in Kerala. The movement focused on the right of entry for Dalits into public spaces, including temples and roads near the Vaikom temple.  However, the second statement is incorrect;  while Periyar supported the movement, it wasn't led solely by him.  T.K. Madhavan and K. Kelappan played crucial leadership roles alongside several others. The third statement is entirely false; the Vaikom Satyagraha had nothing to do with opium cultivation.  It focused solely on social justice and equality.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NMHC's inclusion in the Sagarmala Programme is accurate. The Sagarmala Programme aims to improve India's port infrastructure and coastal connectivity, and the NMHC aligns with this goal.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NMHC is being developed in Gujarat, specifically in Lothal.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NMHC's development is based on a public-private partnership (PPP) model. This means it involves both public and private sector investments and participation in its construction and management.

**Explanation:**

Vallabhbhai Patel's leadership in the Bardoli Satyagraha was instrumental in establishing his reputation as a strong and effective leader. His success in this movement significantly boosted his national prominence and helped solidify his position within the Indian National Congress. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Vallabhbhai Patel, not Mahatma Gandhi, presided over the Karachi session of the Indian National Congress in 1931.  Gandhi did not serve as Congress President at that session.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the title "Iron Man" is associated with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, not Jawaharlal Nehru, due to his efforts in integrating the princely states into India after independence.

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Hindustan Socialist Republican Association's participation in the Kakori train incident is a well-established fact.  The association was a revolutionary group that engaged in armed resistance against British rule.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; while Rajendra Nath Lahiri was a member of the HSRA and involved in revolutionary activities, he wasn't the sole planner of the Kakori train incident.  It involved multiple individuals.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Khudiram Bose was involved in a different revolutionary action (the Muzaffarpur bombing), not the Kakori train incident or the Dakshineshwar bombing.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Tansen's reputation as a master of Dhrupad is historically accurate.  He was a highly skilled musician known for his expertise in this classical Indian music genre. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Tansen served in the court of Akbar, not Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb's reign is known for a different musical style. Statement 3 is also historically inaccurate; while Tansen's early life details are debated, the most accepted accounts place him primarily in the Mughal court under Akbar's patronage, not extensively in Rajput courts.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Manuel Antonio Vassalo e Silva was the Portuguese Governor-General of Goa during its liberation by India in 1961.  The liberation marked the end of Portuguese colonial rule in Goa.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; Francisco de Almeida was a much earlier Portuguese viceroy, not involved in the 1961 events.  Statement 3 is accurate in that Afonso de Albuquerque was a crucial figure in establishing the early Portuguese presence in Goa, but he was not the governor-general during the liberation.

(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

National Farmers Day is observed on December 23rd each year to mark the birth anniversary of Choudhary Charan Singh, a prominent leader known for his advocacy for farmers' rights and welfare.  His contributions to Indian agriculture and his focus on rural development made him a significant figure in this context.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; M.S. Swaminathan's contributions to the Green Revolution are celebrated, but his birth anniversary is not National Farmers Day. Statement 2 is also incorrect; Lal Bahadur Shastri's birth anniversary is not associated with National Farmers Day.

(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bru tribe's practice of Jhum cultivation (slash-and-burn agriculture) in hilly regions is accurate. This traditional agricultural method is typical of several tribal communities in Northeast India.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; terrace farming is not the primary agricultural practice of the Bru tribe.  They are found in hilly areas, not primarily the plains.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Bru tribe is predominantly located in Northeast India, specifically in Tripura, Mizoram, and parts of Assam, not in the Western Ghats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mahatma Gandhi's reiteration of his commitment to non-cooperation and civil disobedience as effective tools against British rule at the Belagavi session is historically accurate.  This reflects his consistent stance on non-violent resistance.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Belagavi session was not presided over by Mahatma Gandhi.  He never actually held the position of Congress President.  Statement 2 is also incorrect, as a consequence of the first statement.  The source text does not mention any session presided over by Gandhi.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Sardar Udham Singh's assassination of General O'Dwyer as revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is a well-documented event.  This act of retribution highlights the deep impact of the massacre on the Indian independence movement.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; while Udham Singh was associated with the Ghadar Party, he was also a member of the HSRA.  His involvement wasn't limited to a single organization. The first statement is incorrect.  The source text does not mention him being solely associated with the Ghadar party.

3. Jallikattu involves the taming of bulls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Jallikattu's association with the Pongal festival and its central element of bull-taming are accurate.  Pongal, a harvest festival in Tamil Nadu, is the time when Jallikattu is traditionally held. The event involves participants attempting to control and subdue bulls. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Jallikattu is a traditional sport of Tamil Nadu, not Karnataka.  It’s deeply rooted in Tamil culture and traditions.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti's title "Garib Nawaz" (friend of the poor) and the Ajmer Sharif Dargah's association with him are accurate. His selfless service and compassionate nature earned him this title, and the Dargah is his mausoleum and a major pilgrimage site. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while Sheikh Nizamuddin Auliya was a prominent disciple, the source doesn't mention Sheikh Salim Chishti as a prominent disciple.  The lineage of disciples includes many prominent figures.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Humayun and Akbar's reigns.  Each question adheres to the specified criteria, aiming for a difficult level of assessment.


**1. With reference to Humayun's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Humayun's initial conquest of Gujarat was followed by a significant period of Mughal control, lasting several decades.
2. Humayun's military campaigns in Bengal resulted in the establishment of a long-lasting Mughal province characterized by stable governance.
3. Humayun's attempts to win over Rajput rulers were largely successful, securing lasting alliances crucial for his consolidation of power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. While Humayun did conquer Gujarat, his control was short-lived and he quickly lost the territory.  His Bengal campaigns, while successful initially, did not lead to lasting stable Mughal rule; the region remained volatile.  Finally, Humayun's interactions with Rajput rulers were characterized by fluctuating alliances and conflicts, rather than the lasting success described in statement 3.  Humayun's reign was marked by instability and frequent reversals of fortune, making the assertion of long-lasting control or successful alliances misleading.


**2. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's administrative reforms significantly reduced the influence of the traditional Jagirdari system, centralizing power in the Mughal court.
2.  Akbar's military campaigns in the Deccan resulted in the immediate and complete subjugation of all Deccani sultanates, leading to their seamless integration into the Mughal Empire.
3. Akbar's policy of Sulh-i-Kul fostered complete religious harmony and eliminated all forms of religious conflict within the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct. While Akbar implemented significant administrative reforms, the Jagirdari system remained a crucial part of the Mughal land revenue system, even if its power was somewhat curtailed.  His Deccan campaigns were protracted and involved significant resistance, and the complete subjugation of the Deccani sultanates was not achieved during his lifetime.  Finally, while Akbar's Sulh-i-Kul promoted religious tolerance, it did not eliminate all religious conflict.  Religious tensions and disputes continued throughout his reign and beyond.


**3. With reference to Akbar's reign and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The construction of Fatehpur Sikri was completed entirely during Akbar's reign and remained the capital of the Mughal Empire throughout his rule.
2.  Akbar's patronage of the arts led to a complete replacement of traditional Indian artistic styles with purely Persian influences, marking a radical shift in Mughal artistic expression.
3. Akbar's economic policies resulted in significant improvements in the lives of all social groups, including peasants and artisans, effectively eliminating poverty and economic disparity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate.  Fatehpur Sikri, while a significant project of Akbar's, was not completed during his reign and was abandoned as the capital city relatively shortly after its construction.  Akbar's patronage of art and architecture led to a synthesis of Indian and Persian styles, not a complete replacement of traditional Indian styles.  Akbar's economic policies, while contributing to some improvements, did not eliminate poverty or economic disparity; significant social and economic inequalities persisted.


**4. With reference to Jahangir's rule, consider the following statements:**

1. Jahangir's reign witnessed a complete abandonment of the Mansabdari system established by Akbar, leading to a decentralized military structure.
2. Jahangir's foreign policy focused primarily on aggressive expansion of Mughal territories into neighbouring regions, resulting in significant territorial gains.
3. Jahangir's patronage of art and architecture resulted in the construction of numerous magnificent buildings and gardens, showcasing a distinct shift towards a more naturalistic style in Mughal painting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is largely accurate.  Jahangir continued to utilize the Mansabdari system, though with some modifications. His foreign policy was less focused on aggressive expansion than Akbar's and more on consolidation and resolving existing conflicts. However, Jahangir's reign did see the creation of impressive architectural projects and a noticeable shift towards naturalism in Mughal painting, particularly evident in the works commissioned under his patronage.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the cultural heritage of India:**

1. The Hornbill Festival, celebrated annually in Nagaland, exclusively showcases the cultural traditions of the Konyak Naga tribe.
2. The Eklingji Temple, built in the 8th century, was originally associated solely with the Pashupata sect of Shaivism.
3.  Nandalal Bose's illustrations for the Indian Constitution were entirely his own work, without any contribution from his team.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The Hornbill Festival celebrates the diverse tribal cultures of Nagaland, not solely the Konyak tribe.  The Eklingji Temple's association evolved over time, encompassing various Shaiva sects.  Nandalal Bose led a team in creating the Constitution's illustrations; it was a collaborative effort.


**6. With reference to the Bharat Ratna and Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded only to Indian citizens, while the Padma Awards can be given to both Indian and foreign nationals.
2.  The Padma Shri is the highest civilian award in India, followed by the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan.
3. Nandalal Bose was a recipient of the Padma Shri but not the Bharat Ratna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The Bharat Ratna is indeed exclusively for Indian citizens, unlike the Padma Awards which can be conferred upon foreign nationals for exceptional and distinguished service. The Padma Vibhushan is the second highest award, followed by the Padma Bhushan and then the Padma Shri. Nandalal Bose received the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award, and was not a recipient of the Padma Shri.  The Bharat Ratna was also conferred upon him.


**7.  With reference to  significant historical figures, consider the following statements:**

1. C. Subramania Bharati was primarily known for his contributions to the field of mathematics and science.
2.  Chakravarti Rajagopalachari served as the first Governor-General of India after independence.
3. Rajendra Nath Lahiri was a key member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is accurate. C. Subramania Bharati was a prominent poet, journalist, and social reformer, not primarily a mathematician or scientist.  Chakravarti Rajagopalachari was the last Governor-General of India, not the first.  Rajendra Nath Lahiri was indeed a significant member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, known for his involvement in revolutionary activities.


**8. With reference to important historical events, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, which commenced in 1924, primarily focused on securing the right to education for lower castes.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi actively participated in the initial protests of the Vaikom Satyagraha.
3. The Hornbill Festival was first organized in Nagaland in 1975.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha primarily focused on the right to access public roads and temples for lower castes, not education. Mahatma Gandhi didn't directly participate in the initial protests but offered support later. The Hornbill Festival began in 2000, not 1975.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that achieving a truly "difficult" level while maintaining complete accuracy and avoiding ambiguity can be challenging.  The difficulty level assigned is an estimate, and the actual difficulty may vary depending on the examinee's knowledge base.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Chaudhary Charan Singh's contributions:**

1. Chaudhary Charan Singh was awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously for his significant contributions to Indian agriculture.
2. The Debt Redemption Bill, a landmark legislation aimed at alleviating rural indebtedness, was introduced by Chaudhary Charan Singh during his tenure as Prime Minister.
3.  Chaudhary Charan Singh's advocacy for land reforms primarily benefited large landowners, thereby strengthening the existing agrarian power structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Chaudhary Charan Singh, a prominent leader known for his championing of farmers' rights, was indeed posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna.  However, it's crucial to note that the award wasn't solely for his time as Prime Minister, but for his entire body of work dedicated to agrarian reform.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chaudhary Charan Singh was a strong advocate for reducing rural indebtedness, the Debt Redemption Bill was introduced much earlier, in 1939, when he was not yet Prime Minister. His efforts to address farmer debt continued throughout his career, but this specific bill predates his Prime Ministership.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Chaudhary Charan Singh's focus on land reforms was explicitly aimed at benefiting marginal and small farmers, a key element of his political ideology.  His policies actively sought to redistribute land ownership and empower the most vulnerable segments of the agricultural population, directly contradicting the statement's claim.  His support for land reforms was a significant departure from the stance of parties like the Swatantra Party, which opposed such measures.


**2. With reference to the impact of land reforms in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, while intended to protect land reform legislation from judicial review, has also been criticized for shielding potentially arbitrary or unjust laws.
2. Zamindari abolition, a crucial component of land reforms, significantly improved the socio-economic conditions of all farmers irrespective of landholding size.
3. The Congress ministries, during their tenure, effectively implemented comprehensive land reforms across all states, leading to widespread equitable distribution of land.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ninth Schedule was indeed created to protect land reform laws from judicial scrutiny. However, this has been a source of contention, as it has sometimes been used to protect laws that are considered to be unfair or violate fundamental rights, thus undermining the principles of justice.  The inclusion of laws under the Ninth Schedule is not a guarantee of their inherent fairness or effectiveness.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While zamindari abolition was a significant step towards improving agrarian equity, its impact wasn't universally positive. While it did benefit many marginal and small farmers, its implementation was uneven across regions, and the benefits didn't always reach all farmers equally. Large landowners often found ways to circumvent the reforms, limiting the overall impact on socio-economic conditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The implementation of land reforms varied significantly across different states and periods, with the Congress ministries not achieving uniform success across the board. Several factors, including political resistance from vested interests and administrative challenges, hindered the complete and equitable implementation of land reforms, preventing widespread land redistribution.


**3. With reference to factors influencing agricultural productivity in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) primarily focuses on increasing the use of chemical fertilizers to boost crop yields, prioritizing quantity over sustainable practices.
2.  Farm mechanization, while increasing agricultural productivity, has also led to concerns regarding environmental sustainability and displacement of agricultural labor in certain regions.
3. Climate change, characterized by unpredictable monsoon rainfall patterns, poses a significant threat to India's agricultural productivity, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, a region known for its high agricultural output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMSA aims for sustainable agricultural practices; while increased productivity is a goal, it explicitly incorporates sustainable methods and aims to reduce reliance on solely chemical fertilizers.  The program emphasizes integrated nutrient management, soil health, and water conservation.

Statement 2 is correct. Farm mechanization has demonstrably increased agricultural productivity. However, it has also led to concerns about environmental impact (soil degradation, increased energy consumption), and the displacement of agricultural labor, particularly in areas where small farmers cannot afford the machinery or lack access to training.

Statement 3 is correct.  Climate change significantly impacts agricultural productivity in India.  Unpredictable monsoons and extreme weather events directly affect crop yields, and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, a crucial agricultural area, is particularly vulnerable to these changes.  The instability created by climate change destabilizes agricultural practices and creates uncertainty for farmers.


**4. With reference to the impact of climate change, consider the following statements:**

1. The thawing of permafrost regions, a direct consequence of climate change, primarily impacts biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems, leaving low-lying coastal areas relatively unaffected.
2. Climate change adversely affects children's rights, particularly in relation to health, education, and protection from exploitation, exacerbating existing inequalities.
3.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI), while influenced by various factors, is not directly impacted by climate change, as food insecurity is primarily a result of socioeconomic factors rather than environmental ones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Thawing permafrost has far-reaching consequences beyond high-altitude ecosystems. It contributes to sea-level rise, which directly impacts low-lying coastal areas and island nations.  The release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from thawing permafrost further accelerates climate change, creating a global impact.

Statement 2 is correct. Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, disproportionately affecting children.  Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity caused by climate change all severely impact children's well-being, health, access to education, and protection from various forms of exploitation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Climate change is a major contributor to food insecurity and thus directly impacts the GHI.  Changes in rainfall patterns, increased frequency of droughts and floods, and shifts in agricultural productivity all directly affect food availability, leading to malnutrition and hunger, factors that heavily influence the GHI.  While socioeconomic factors are also significant, climate change is a key driver of food insecurity worldwide.


**5. With reference to the Mahad Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahad Satyagraha, led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, primarily focused on securing political rights for Dalits, rather than addressing social inequalities.
2. The Mahad Satyagraha was a non-violent movement, reflecting Gandhian principles of Satyagraha, although it faced significant resistance from the dominant caste groups.
3. The Mahad Satyagraha's success significantly altered the social and political landscape of India, leading to immediate and widespread eradication of untouchability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Mahad Satyagraha did have political implications, its primary focus was on challenging the deeply entrenched social inequalities and discrimination faced by Dalits, particularly the denial of access to public resources like water sources.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Mahad Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent movement, but it faced considerable resistance and violence from the dominant caste groups.  The participants' commitment to non-violence was a key aspect of the movement’s strategy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Mahad Satyagraha was a significant step in the struggle against untouchability, its impact was not immediate or widespread. The eradication of untouchability required sustained efforts over many decades, and the movement, although impactful, did not lead to the immediate elimination of the practice.


**6. With reference to the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ASI only includes factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948, excluding other forms of industrial establishments.
2. The ASI data is collected under the Collection of Statistics Act, 2008, and covers all manufacturing industries, regardless of their size or ownership.
3.  The ASI does not include electricity undertakings engaged in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, as these are covered by separate surveys conducted by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bill actually *increases* the number of nominees allowed in bank accounts, not reduces it. This is to provide greater flexibility to account holders.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Bill does redefine 'substantial interest' and raises the limit for directorships in cooperative banks. This change in the definition is expected to have implications for corporate governance and the management structures of these financial institutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bill actually *increases* the tenure, not reduces it.  This is to provide greater stability and experience in the management of cooperative banks.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The DPIIT plays a crucial role in formulating and implementing India's FDI policy.  It provides guidelines, approvals, and monitors FDI inflows.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a significant portion of FDI flows through the capital account, it's not exclusively limited to it.  Other mechanisms and routes might also be used depending on the nature of investment and regulatory frameworks.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While certain sectors might have restrictions or specific regulations, the Insurance sector in India does *allow* FDI, albeit with certain stipulations and limitations imposed for regulatory and national security purposes.  The exact percentage and conditions are subject to change based on government policy.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's surplus transfer to the Government of India is mandated by the RBI Act, 1934.
2.  The RBI's primary function is to regulate only commercial banks.
3.  The RBI is responsible for issuing and circulating digital rupees (e₹).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI Act, 1934, outlines the RBI’s responsibility to transfer its surplus profits to the Government of India.  This is a crucial aspect of the RBI's relationship with the central government and reflects the government's ownership of the RBI.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI's regulatory purview extends far beyond commercial banks. It regulates a wide range of financial institutions, including Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs), Credit Information Companies (CICs), Payment System Participants, and others.  The scope of its regulation is constantly evolving in line with the changing financial landscape.

Statement 3 is correct. The RBI is actively involved in the introduction and management of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the digital rupee (e₹),  responsible for its issuance, circulation, and overall management within the Indian payment system.


**3. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The government fixes MSP for all agricultural crops produced in India.
2.  The MSP mechanism is solely aimed at ensuring price stability for consumers.
3.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) plays a significant role in procuring agricultural produce at MSP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the government does fix MSPs, it is not for *all* agricultural crops. The number of crops covered under MSP varies and is subject to policy changes.  The government prioritizes crops considered crucial for food security and farmer livelihoods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary objective of the MSP mechanism is to provide a safety net for farmers, protecting them against sharp price declines in the market. While it indirectly impacts consumer prices, price stability for consumers is not its sole or primary aim.

Statement 3 is correct. The FCI is a key player in the MSP procurement system. It purchases agricultural produce from farmers at the MSP, ensuring farmers receive a guaranteed minimum price for their produce.  This procurement plays a significant role in the government's efforts to manage food security and support farmers.


**4.  With reference to India's Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) program, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) solely manages the SPR program.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ONGC plays a significant role, the SPR program's management is not solely its responsibility.  Other public sector undertakings and government agencies are also involved in various aspects of the program, including storage, logistics, and strategic decision-making.

Statement 2 is correct. Phase II of the SPR program aims to add significant storage capacity to the existing infrastructure built under Phase I. The expansion helps build a larger buffer against potential disruptions in global oil supply chains.

Statement 3 is correct. The core purpose of the SPR program is to enhance India's energy security by creating a reserve of crude oil to mitigate the impact of potential supply shocks or geopolitical uncertainties.  This reduces the country's vulnerability to disruptions in global oil markets.


**5. With reference to the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), consider the following statements:**

1. A higher REER always implies a stronger currency and improved export competitiveness.
2. The REER is calculated using a weighted average of bilateral exchange rates against major trading partners.
3.  The REER takes into account price differences between countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a higher REER can indicate a stronger currency, it doesn't automatically translate to improved export competitiveness. A higher REER makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, potentially harming export competitiveness.  The impact on competitiveness depends on various other factors, including global demand, productivity, and other economic conditions.

Statement 2 is correct. The REER is calculated based on a weighted average of a country's bilateral exchange rates with its major trading partners. The weights reflect the relative importance of each trading partner in a country's trade.

Statement 3 is correct. The REER differs from the nominal exchange rate (NER) by accounting for price level differences (inflation) between the home country and its trading partners. This adjustment makes it a more accurate measure of a currency's real value and competitiveness in international trade.  The price differences are typically incorporated using price indices or deflators.


**6. With reference to the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE), consider the following statements:**

1.  ASUSE captures data on unincorporated non-agricultural establishments across all sectors of the Indian economy.
2.  ASUSE data is primarily used for policy formulation related to the formal sector.
3.  ASUSE provides insights into employment and income patterns in the informal sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ASUSE covers a significant portion of the unincorporated non-agricultural sector, it does not encompass *all* sectors. The specific sectors covered are subject to the survey's design and may vary across years.  The goal is to have a comprehensive picture of the informal sector, but it might not cover every sub-sector in equal detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ASUSE data is crucial for understanding the informal sector, which is a significant portion of the Indian economy.  The data is used to inform policies aimed at supporting and developing the informal sector, not solely the formal sector.  Policies related to MSMEs, employment, and social security schemes often rely heavily on ASUSE data.

Statement 3 is correct. ASUSE is a critical source of data on employment and income patterns within India's extensive unincorporated non-agricultural sector. It provides valuable insights into the working conditions, income levels, and other characteristics of workers in the informal sector. This data helps in policy formulation regarding social security, labour laws, and economic development strategies for the informal sector.


**7. Consider the following statements about the current account deficit (CAD):**

1. A CAD indicates that a country's imports of goods and services exceed its exports.
2. A CAD always signifies an unsustainable economic situation.
3. A CAD is financed through capital inflows.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAD reflects the difference between a country's total earnings from exports (goods and services) and its total spending on imports (goods and services).  A negative balance (more imports than exports) results in a CAD.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a persistent and large CAD can pose challenges, it doesn't always indicate an unsustainable economic situation.  The size and sustainability of a CAD depend on various factors, including the country's economic fundamentals, its growth rate, foreign investment levels, and global economic conditions. A moderate CAD during a period of strong economic growth may not be a concern.

Statement 3 is correct.  A CAD is typically financed through capital inflows. These inflows can come from foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign portfolio investment (FPI), foreign borrowings, and other sources.  These capital inflows essentially offset the deficit in the current account, enabling the country to continue its import spending.


**8. With reference to India's fisheries sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the world's largest fish producer.
2. The fisheries sector is officially recognized as a "Sunrise Sector".
3. World Fisheries Day is celebrated annually on November 21st.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is a major fish producer, it is not the *largest* globally.  China consistently holds the top position in global fish production.  India's position varies depending on the year and data source but is among the top producers.

Statement 2 is correct. The fisheries sector has been recognized as a "Sunrise Sector" in India, reflecting its significant potential for economic growth and job creation.  The government has implemented various schemes and initiatives to modernize and expand the sector.

Statement 3 is correct. World Fisheries Day is indeed observed annually on November 21st to raise awareness about the importance of sustainable fisheries management and conservation.  The date is significant for promoting responsible fishing practices.


**9. With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha Speaker is elected by the Rajya Sabha.
2.  A no-confidence motion can be moved against the Council of Ministers only in the Lok Sabha.
3. The Lok Sabha can amend the Constitution with a simple majority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only



**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lok Sabha Speaker is elected by the members of the Lok Sabha itself, not the Rajya Sabha. The election process involves a secret ballot and requires a majority vote.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha, being the lower house of Parliament and directly representing the people, holds the power to move a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers.  This is a crucial mechanism for holding the government accountable to the people's representatives. The Rajya Sabha cannot move a no-confidence motion.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Lok Sabha cannot amend the Constitution with a simple majority.  Constitutional amendments require a special majority, which includes a majority of the total membership of both Houses of Parliament and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of each House present and voting.


**10. With reference to Cess and Surcharge, consider the following statements:**

1. Cess is always levied for a specific earmarked purpose.
2. Surcharge is always levied on income tax only.
3. Both Cess and Surcharge are included in the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cess is often levied for a specific purpose, it is not always the case.  The government's intention behind levying a Cess may or may not be to earmark it for a particular use. It depends on the specific legislation under which it is imposed.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Surcharge is frequently levied on income tax, it's not always limited to income tax.  It can be levied on other forms of taxes as well, depending on the government's policy and legislative intent.

Statement 3 is correct.  Both Cess and Surcharge, once collected, form part of the Consolidated Fund of India. This fund is the main account where all government revenues are deposited and from where all government expenditure is made.  This means they are not kept separately but contribute to the general revenue pool.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Council of Ministers in India:**

1. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Rajya Sabha, which can initiate a no-confidence motion against it.
2.  The size of the Council of Ministers is explicitly defined in the Constitution and cannot exceed 15% of the Lok Sabha's strength.
3. The President of India appoints the Prime Minister, who then appoints the other members of the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  While the Rajya Sabha can discuss and scrutinize the government's actions, only the Lok Sabha can bring down the government through a no-confidence motion.  The Lok Sabha represents the directly elected representatives of the people, making it the body ultimately accountable to the citizenry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't explicitly define the maximum size of the Council of Ministers.  The 91st Amendment Act of 2003 introduced a limit, but it's a percentage of the Lok Sabha's strength, not a fixed number.  Furthermore, the precise percentage is subject to interpretation and can be adjusted.  The size has historically varied based on the needs of the government and political considerations.

Statement 3 is correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, usually the leader of the party or coalition that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister then advises the President on the appointment of other ministers, who form the Council of Ministers. This process reflects the parliamentary system's conventions and power dynamics.


**2. With reference to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lok Sabha's term is five years, while the Rajya Sabha is a permanent house, with one-third of its members retiring every two years.
2.  Both houses have equal powers in passing ordinary bills, but the Lok Sabha has exclusive power over money bills.
3. The President can nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, representing the arts, science, literature, and social service.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lok Sabha, being the House of the People, has a five-year term, subject to dissolution before the completion of its term. The Rajya Sabha, the Council of States, is a continuous body, with one-third of its members retiring every two years, ensuring its continuity.

Statement 2 is correct. Both houses have concurrent powers regarding ordinary bills, requiring passage through both to become law. However, the Lok Sabha holds exclusive power over money bills; the Rajya Sabha can only delay or suggest amendments but cannot reject a money bill. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.

Statement 3 is correct.  The President of India has the power to nominate up to twelve members to the Rajya Sabha, who are distinguished individuals in the fields of literature, science, art, and social service. This provision aims to incorporate expertise from various fields into the upper house.


**3. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. GST is a single indirect tax that replaced multiple indirect taxes like excise duty, VAT, and service tax, coming into effect on July 1, 2017.
2. The GST Council, chaired by the Union Finance Minister, decides on tax rates, exemptions, and revenue sharing between the Centre and states, with a 2/3rd majority vote required for decision-making.
3.  The GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) is a constitutional body that hears appeals against orders passed by the appellate authority or revisional authority.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST, introduced on July 1, 2017, following the 101st Constitutional Amendment, unified various indirect taxes into a single national tax system.  This reform aimed to simplify the tax structure and improve tax efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A 3/4th majority, not 2/3rd, is required for decision-making in the GST Council. The Centre holds a significant share (33%) of the votes, reflecting its role in the national tax system.  The Council's decisions are crucial for maintaining a balance between the Centre's and states' interests in tax collection and revenue sharing.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) is a statutory body, established under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, not a constitutional body.  Its role is essential for resolving disputes related to GST implementation and ensuring a fair and efficient appeal process.


**4. With reference to Public Debt and Fiscal Policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The combined debt-to-GDP ratio of the Centre and states should be brought down to 60% by 2023, according to the recommendations of the N.K. Singh Committee.
2.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that India's public debt-to-GDP ratio remained relatively stable between 2005-06 and 2022-23, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  Off-budget borrowings (OBBs) are borrowings made directly by the government and reflected in the budget, helping to avoid fiscal deficit targets under the FRBM Act, 2003.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The N.K. Singh Committee recommended bringing down the combined debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% by 2023, but this target year has passed, and the actual outcome might differ significantly. The committee's recommendations highlight the need for fiscal consolidation but don't guarantee the achievement of the target within the specified timeframe.

Statement 2 is correct. The IMF report indicated that India's public debt-to-GDP ratio remained relatively stable during the period mentioned, despite the fiscal stimulus packages implemented to address the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This stability reflects India's macroeconomic resilience.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Off-budget borrowings (OBBs) are borrowings made *indirectly* by the government, *not* reflected in the budget, and are used to circumvent fiscal deficit targets.  They are taken by public institutions on the government’s direction, creating a hidden liability and affecting fiscal transparency and accountability.  The statement incorrectly describes OBBs as being reflected in the budget.


**5. With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha Speaker presides over the House and is elected by the members of the Lok Sabha.
2.  The Lok Sabha has the power to impeach the President of India, but only with the concurrence of the Rajya Sabha.
3.  The Lok Sabha can introduce and pass money bills, which the Rajya Sabha can only review for a maximum of 14 days.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by the members of the Lok Sabha itself. The Speaker presides over the House's proceedings, maintains order, and interprets the rules of procedure.  The Speaker's neutrality and impartiality are essential for the smooth functioning of the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha, along with the Rajya Sabha, has the power to impeach the President of India.  This process requires a special majority in both houses, highlighting the gravity of the action and the need for broad consensus.

Statement 3 is correct.  Money bills can only originate in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can consider a money bill for a maximum of 14 days, but it cannot reject it.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters and the government's accountability to the lower house.


These questions aim to be challenging by incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise knowledge of Indian political and economic systems.  They also evaluate multiple cognitive skills beyond simple factual recall, demanding analysis and evaluation of different aspects of the given topics.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NCRB primarily focuses on Indian crime data, its mandate extends to investigating crimes committed outside India if they involve Indian citizens or affect Indian interests.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCRB's establishment was based on the recommendations of multiple committees, including the National Police Commission and others; the Tandon Committee is not solely credited. Statement 3 is correct. The Ministry of Home Affairs is the overarching ministry responsible for the NCRB's functioning and policy direction.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the NCRB's organizational context and oversight.


**2. With reference to the Verma Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Verma Committee's primary focus was on reforming the criminal justice system, specifically addressing issues related to police efficiency and judicial processes.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Verma Committee indeed focused on improving the efficiency of the police and judiciary within the criminal justice system.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Punchhi Commission followed up on the Sarkaria Commission's work, not the Verma Committee's, regarding Centre-State relations.  The Verma Committee's primary area of focus was criminal justice reform, a distinct area from Centre-State relations. Statement 3 is correct. The Verma Committee's work did involve identifying legal provisions relating to fundamental duties. Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**3. With reference to the Protected Area Permit (PAP), consider the following statements:**

1.  Only foreign nationals are required to obtain a PAP to visit Arunachal Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While foreign nationals require PAPs for Arunachal Pradesh,  Indian citizens, including NRIs, PIO cardholders, and OCI holders, also require permits for certain restricted areas.  Statement 2 is correct. The PAP system's primary function is to control access to ecologically or strategically sensitive regions, regardless of nationality, for security and environmental protection reasons. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Home Affairs plays a crucial role, the specific requirements for obtaining a PAP vary by state and are not solely determined by the Ministry of External Affairs.  Only statement 2 accurately reflects the core purpose of the PAP system.


**4. With reference to the Punchhi Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. Madan Mohan Punchhi chaired the Punchhi Commission, which primarily focused on electoral reforms.
2. The Sarkaria Commission's recommendations directly influenced the Punchhi Commission's investigation into Centre-State relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madan Mohan Punchhi did chair the commission, its focus was not electoral reform but Centre-State relations. Statement 2 is correct. The Punchhi Commission directly followed up on the Sarkaria Commission's work on Centre-State relations, building upon its previous findings and recommendations. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Punchhi Commission's work did not primarily concern judicial restructuring; it focused on improving Centre-State relations. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

1. Himachal Pradesh was entirely a Union Territory before it became a state.
2. The lost-wax process is a traditional bronze sculpture technique exclusively practiced in Himachal Pradesh.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. JPCs are not permanent committees; they are constituted for specific purposes and have a defined lifespan. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Members of a JPC are drawn from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.  Statement 3 is correct.  A JPC is indeed dissolved once it completes its work and submits its report.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**7. With reference to judicial accountability in India, consider the following statements:**

(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution clearly stipulates that a judge can only be removed for "proved misbehaviour or incapacity." Statement 2 is incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Good Governance Index is not released by the Ministry of Home Affairs but by NITI Aayog. Statement 2 is incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President can promulgate an ordinance when *either* House of Parliament is not in session, not necessarily both. Statement 2 is correct.  An ordinance has the same force as an Act of Parliament but must be approved by Parliament within six months; otherwise, it lapses. Statement 3 is incorrect.

The Vice-President is the ex-officio Chairman. Statement 3 is also correct.  While the Rajya Sabha can review a money bill, it cannot indefinitely delay its passage; it must return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister's recommendation is significant, the President appoints the CEC and Election Commissioners; it is not solely based on the Prime Minister's recommendation. Statement 2 is incorrect. The term is six years or until the age of 65, but the statement incorrectly combined these two criteria.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The grounds for removal are specified in the Constitution (proved misbehaviour or incapacity). Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Railways:**

1.  The Railway Board's statutory backing was established through the Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
2.  The Indian Railway Board Act, 1905, remains a separate legal entity alongside the Railways Act, 1989.
3.  An independent regulator, as proposed in the Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024, will oversee aspects like tariffs, safety, and private sector participation in Indian Railways.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to provide statutory backing to the Railway Board, a significant step considering its previous operation without formal legal sanction.  This addresses a long-standing governance gap.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The bill explicitly aims to merge the Indian Railway Board Act, 1905, into the Railways Act, 1989, streamlining the legal framework governing Indian Railways. This consolidation simplifies the regulatory environment.

Statement 3 is correct. The establishment of an independent regulator is a key feature of the proposed amendments.  This independent oversight is intended to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency in various operational aspects of the Indian Railways, including tariff setting, safety standards, and the management of private sector involvement.  This move aligns with global best practices in railway regulation.  The creation of this regulator is a major step towards better governance and improved performance.


**2. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lok Adalats are empowered to handle only pre-litigation disputes and cannot deal with cases already pending in civil courts.
2.  Decisions of Lok Adalats are final and binding, with no provision for appeal to higher courts.
3.  The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, provides the statutory framework for the establishment and functioning of Lok Adalats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Adalats possess the authority to address both pre-litigation disputes and cases already pending in courts of law.  This is a crucial aspect of their role in reducing court backlogs and providing efficient dispute resolution.

Statement 2 is correct. The decisions or awards made by Lok Adalats are final and binding on all parties involved. There is no legal avenue for appeal against these decisions, making them a swift and conclusive mechanism. This finality contributes to the efficiency of the Lok Adalat system.

Statement 3 is correct. The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, is the foundational legislation that establishes Lok Adalats within the broader framework of legal services in India. This Act defines their powers, jurisdiction, and procedures, ensuring a consistent and regulated approach to their operation.  The act provides crucial legal backing for their functioning and enhances their legitimacy.


**3. With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's pardon power under Article 72 can be exercised solely at the President's discretion, without any requirement for ministerial advice.
2.  The President's pardon power extends to all cases where the punishment or sentence is for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.
3. The Supreme Court has held that judicial review of the President's pardon power is limited to exceptional circumstances where the decision is demonstrably arbitrary, irrational, discriminatory, or mala fide.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court case of *Maru Ram v. Union of India* (1980) established that the President does not exercise the pardon power independently. The President acts on the advice of the Union government (the Council of Ministers). This ensures that the exercise of this significant power is consistent with the principles of responsible government.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon in cases where the sentence is for an offence against any law relating to a matter within the Union's executive power. This broad scope reflects the President's role as the head of state and the ultimate authority in matters of clemency.

Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court has significantly limited the scope of judicial review of the President's pardon power.  The Court will intervene only in exceptional cases where the decision is demonstrably flawed on grounds of arbitrariness, irrationality, discrimination, or mala fides. This restricted review reflects the Court's recognition of the executive nature of the pardon power and the need to avoid undue interference in its exercise.


**4.  With reference to the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India has the sole authority to initiate the process of removing a judge under this Act.
2. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha has the discretion to admit or reject a motion for the removal of a judge.
3.  Consultation with the President is mandatory before the Speaker/Chairman decides on a motion for the removal of a judge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the process of removing a judge involves multiple steps and actors, including Parliament, the President does not have the *sole* authority to initiate the process.  The initiation of the removal process is triggered by a motion introduced in either House of Parliament.

Statement 2 is correct. The Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, grants the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha the crucial power to determine whether a motion for the removal of a judge merits further consideration. This initial screening prevents frivolous motions from proceeding and safeguards the independence of the judiciary.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Speaker/Chairman *may* consult with the President, such consultation is not mandatory under the Act.  The Speaker/Chairman's decision to admit or reject the motion is based on their independent assessment of the motion's merit.


**5. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCI operates under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
2. The CCI's composition includes a Chairperson and a minimum of two other members.
3. The CCI's objectives include eliminating practices that adversely affect competition, promoting competition, protecting consumer interests, and ensuring freedom of trade in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCI operates under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  This is a crucial distinction reflecting the CCI's focus on corporate practices and their impact on competition.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Competition Act, 2002, mandates that the CCI comprises a Chairperson and at least two, but not more than six, other members. This composition ensures a sufficient number of experts to handle the diverse range of competition matters that come before the commission.

Statement 3 is correct. The CCI's objectives, as outlined in the Competition Act, 2002, encompass a wide range of pro-competitive goals.  These include the elimination of anti-competitive practices, the promotion of a healthy competitive environment, the protection of consumer welfare, and the safeguarding of freedom of trade within the Indian market.  These objectives aim to create a dynamic and efficient market economy.


**6. With reference to the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), consider the following statements:**

1. Article 44 of the Constitution directs the State to implement a UCC immediately.
2.  The UCC aims to replace diverse personal laws based on religious affiliations with a uniform set of laws governing personal matters.
3. The UCC would cover all personal matters, including marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession, for all citizens regardless of religion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 44 of the Constitution uses the word "endeavour," indicating that the implementation of a UCC is a directive principle of state policy, not a legally enforceable directive.  The state *should strive* towards this goal, but it is not a mandatory immediate action.

Statement 2 is correct. The fundamental objective of the UCC is to replace the existing multiplicity of personal laws, which vary across different religious communities, with a single, unified set of laws. This aims to create a more equitable and uniform legal framework for personal matters.

Statement 3 is correct. The scope of a UCC would encompass the entire range of personal matters, including marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession.  This comprehensive approach is designed to create a truly uniform legal system applicable to all citizens irrespective of their religious beliefs.


**7. With reference to the Henderson Doctrine, consider the following statements:**

1. The Henderson Doctrine is a concept that originated in Indian jurisprudence, codified in Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
2.  The Henderson Doctrine prevents the relitigation of issues that were, or could have been, addressed in earlier court proceedings.
3. The Henderson Doctrine, as explained by the Supreme Court, is a natural corollary of the Indian doctrine of constructive res judicata.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has connected the Henderson Doctrine to the Indian doctrine of constructive res judicata, the doctrine's origin lies in English case law, specifically the 1843 case *Henderson v. Henderson*.  It's not an indigenous Indian legal concept.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core principle of the Henderson Doctrine is to prevent the repetition of already litigated matters. It aims to promote finality in judicial decisions and prevent the wasteful expenditure of judicial resources on issues already decided.  This contributes to judicial efficiency.

Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court has explicitly linked the Henderson Doctrine to the Indian principle of constructive res judicata, which prevents the relitigation of issues that could have been raised in prior proceedings.  This demonstrates the integration of the doctrine into the Indian legal system, even though its origin is foreign.


**8. With reference to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCRB was established in the 1970s based on the recommendations of the Tandon Committee.
2. The NCRB functions under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
3. The National Police Commission (1977-1981) also advocated for the creation of a centralized crime records agency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Tandon Committee's recommendations were instrumental in establishing a national crime records bureau, the NCRB was actually established in 1986, not the 1970s. The committee's report laid the groundwork but the actual establishment came later.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCRB operates under the administrative oversight of the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This reflects the bureau's vital role in national security and crime prevention.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Police Commission, in its report, strongly recommended the establishment of a centralized crime records agency to improve data collection, analysis, and crime-fighting strategies across India.  This highlights the broader policy context for the creation of the NCRB.  The commission's recommendations were influential in shaping the structure and function of the NCRB.


**9. With reference to Protected Area Permits (PAPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All foreign nationals require a PAP to enter Arunachal Pradesh.
2.  Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Sikkim require PAPs for entry into their entire geographical areas.
3.  PAPs are required to visit areas close to international borders or with sensitive security concerns.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The entire state of Arunachal Pradesh falls under the Protected Area regime, mandating PAPs for all foreign nationals. This stringent requirement stems from its proximity to international borders and sensitive security considerations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Sikkim have areas that necessitate PAPs, the entire states do not fall under this regime.  Only specific regions within these states require such permits.

Statement 3 is correct.  PAPs are primarily designed to regulate access to areas with strategic importance, security concerns, or environmental sensitivity, particularly those near international borders.  This controlled access is crucial for national security and environmental protection.


**10. Consider the following statements about Joint Parliamentary Committees (JPCs):**

1. A JPC is a permanent committee of Parliament.
2.  A JPC's recommendations are binding on the government.
3.  JPCs include members from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. JPCs are *ad hoc* committees formed by Parliament for specific purposes.  They are not permanent, and their existence is limited to the duration of their assigned task. Once the task is completed, the committee is dissolved.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The recommendations of a JPC carry significant weight and influence, but they are not legally binding on the government.  The government is not obligated to accept the recommendations. However, they are usually considered carefully and are often persuasive in shaping policy.

Statement 3 is correct. JPCs are composed of members from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, ensuring representation from both houses of Parliament.  This balanced composition contributes to the legitimacy and comprehensiveness of the committee's work.



**11. With reference to Adjournment sine die, consider the following statements:**

1. Adjournment sine die signifies the indefinite adjournment of a parliamentary session with a specified date for the next meeting.
2. The power to adjourn sine die rests with the President of India.
3.  The House can be reconvened after an adjournment sine die at any time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Adjournment sine die means the indefinite adjournment of a parliamentary session *without* specifying a date for the next meeting.  It's an adjournment without a fixed date for resumption.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The power to adjourn a House sine die lies with the presiding officer of the House (Speaker for Lok Sabha or Chairman for Rajya Sabha), not the President of India. The President's role is distinct and primarily related to summoning and proroguing Parliament.

Statement 3 is correct.  The presiding officer retains the authority to reconvene the House at any time after an adjournment sine die, depending on the need or urgency.  This flexibility allows for the Parliament to respond to unforeseen circumstances or pressing issues.


**12. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established by the Constitution of India.
2. The NHRC Chairperson must be a retired Supreme Court judge.
3. The NHRC has all the powers of a civil court.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a *statutory* body, established under the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993, not a constitutional body.  It's created by an Act of Parliament, not directly by the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The PHRA, 1993, mandates that the Chairperson of the NHRC must be a retired Chief Justice of India or a retired judge of the Supreme Court. This ensures that the commission is headed by a person with extensive legal experience and expertise in human rights law.

Statement 3 is correct. The NHRC is vested with the powers of a civil court for the purposes of its inquiry and investigation.  This includes the power to summon witnesses, examine evidence, and compel the production of documents.  These powers are crucial for effective investigation of human rights violations.


**13.  Consider the following statements about the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023:**

1. The Act decriminalizes over 200 provisions across 50 laws.
2. The Act introduces a mechanism for periodic revision of fines and penalties.
3. The Act completely removes all offences and penalties under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Jan Vishwas Act decriminalizes 183 provisions across 42 laws, not over 200 provisions across 50 laws. While the number is substantial, it's not as high as stated.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the Act is the provision for a periodic (every three years) revision of fines and penalties for various offences under specific acts. This mechanism aims to keep penalties relevant and aligned with contemporary circumstances.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act comprehensively removes all offences and penalties under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, significantly simplifying the legal framework related to postal services.  This decriminalization reflects the Act's goal of promoting ease of living and doing business.



**14. With reference to Transfer Pricing and Arm's Length Principle (ALP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The arm's length price (ALP) is determined by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT).
2.  The Supreme Court ruling has made the ITAT's determination of ALP in transfer pricing matters final and non-justiciable.
3. Transfer pricing provisions and ALP are contained in Chapter X of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ALP is initially determined by the Assessing Officer, not the ITAT. The ITAT's role is to hear appeals against the Assessing Officer's determination.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court ruling *overturned* the Karnataka High Court's decision, which stated that the ITAT's ALP determination was final. The Supreme Court restored the possibility of judicial review in cases where the ALP determination is found to be outside the purview of relevant transfer pricing provisions.

Statement 3 is correct. Chapter X of the Income Tax Act, 1961, indeed contains the provisions related to transfer pricing and ALP in India. This chapter is a crucial part of India's tax code for multinational companies.




**15. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. India ranked below 50th in the GII 2023.
2.  The GII is co-published by Cornell University, INSEAD Business School, and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
3. Switzerland secured the top rank in the GII 2023 for the 13th consecutive year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's rank in the GII 2023 was 40th, which is below 50.

Statement 2 is correct. The GII is indeed a joint publication of Cornell University, INSEAD Business School, and WIPO. This collaborative effort brings together expertise from academia, business, and international intellectual property organizations.

Statement 3 is correct.  Switzerland maintained its top position in the GII 2023 for the 13th consecutive year, reflecting its strong innovation ecosystem.


**16. With reference to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIS was established under the BIS Act, 2016.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only



**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the BIS was restructured by the BIS Act, 2016, it was initially established under the BIS Act, 1986. The 2016 act updated and improved the functioning of the organization.

Statement 2 is correct. The BIS functions under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, reflecting its role in ensuring product quality and consumer protection.

Statement 3 is correct. The BIS has indeed awarded product certification (both mandatory and voluntary) to more than 1000 products, promoting quality standards and consumer confidence in the Indian market.  This vast certification portfolio demonstrates the BIS's significant role in quality control.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding Article 3 of the Indian Constitution:**

2. If a bill affects the area, boundaries, or name of any state, the President must refer it to the state legislature for its views.
3.  The word "State," as used in Article 3(a), specifically excludes Union Territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 3 stipulates that a bill concerning the formation of new states or alteration of existing ones must be introduced in Parliament only with the President's prior recommendation. This ensures that such significant constitutional changes are carefully considered.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 further mandates that if a bill affects the area, boundaries, or name of any state, the President must seek the views of the affected state legislature before the bill proceeds. This ensures that the states have a voice in matters directly affecting them.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Explanation 1 to Article 3 clarifies that the term "State" in Article 3(a) *includes* Union Territories.  This shows that the constitutional provisions relating to state formation and boundary changes are equally applicable to Union Territories.


**18. With reference to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Act, 1991, consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GNCTD Act, 1991, in conjunction with the 69th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1991, conferred special status on Delhi, designating it as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The LG's powers are not entirely dependent on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. The Act defines areas where the LG has discretionary powers independent of the council of ministers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Delhi Legislative Assembly's legislative competence is restricted; it cannot legislate on subjects like police, public order, and land. Parliament retains the power to legislate on all matters related to Delhi.


**19. With reference to preventive detention in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Preventive detention requires a trial and conviction by a court of law before detention.
2.  The protection against arrest and detention under Articles 22(1) and 22(2) applies to persons detained under preventive detention laws.
3.  Both Parliament and state legislatures can make laws for preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Preventive detention is fundamentally different from regular criminal procedure; it involves detention *without* a trial or conviction. The basis for detention is the apprehension of future harm, not proven past wrongdoing.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 22(3) explicitly states that the protections under Articles 22(1) and 22(2) do *not* apply to persons arrested or detained under preventive detention laws.

Statement 3 is correct.  Concurrent legislative powers are granted to both Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws concerning preventive detention for reasons related to the security of a state, maintenance of public order, and maintenance of supplies and services.  This reflects the federal structure of Indian governance.



**20. With reference to personality rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Personality rights are explicitly defined and protected under the Indian Constitution.
2.  The right to publicity is primarily governed by the Trade Marks Act, 1999, and the Copyright Act, 1957.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Personality rights are not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution but are derived from the right to privacy (Article 21) and the right to property.  Judicial pronouncements have shaped their interpretation and application.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Trade Marks Act, 1999, and the Copyright Act, 1957, provide significant legal protection for aspects of personality rights, particularly the right to publicity.  These acts offer mechanisms to prevent commercial exploitation of a person's identity without consent.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, also protects the unauthorized use of the names and symbols of *deceased* dignitaries listed in its schedule.  The protection extends beyond living individuals.


**21. Consider the following statements regarding hate speech in India:**

1.  Hate speech is explicitly defined under the Indian Penal Code.
2.  Article 19(2) of the Constitution allows for the restriction of speech that incites hatred against groups of persons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  There is no single, explicit definition of hate speech in any specific Indian law.  The legal response to hate speech often relies on the interpretation of existing laws and constitutional provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 19(2) of the Constitution allows for reasonable restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression, including those that promote hatred against a group of persons, on grounds of public order, morality, and security of the state.  This is a crucial constitutional provision in addressing hate speech.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Hate speech can be disseminated both offline and online.  While the legal frameworks for addressing online hate speech are still evolving, the principle of restricting hate speech applies to both online and offline platforms.  The reach of online platforms necessitates a robust legal response to online hate speech.


**22. With reference to the ordinance-making power of the President and Governor, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can promulgate ordinances only when both Houses of Parliament are in session.
2.  An ordinance lapses automatically after six weeks from the commencement of the next session of the legislature.
3. A Governor can always promulgate an ordinance without reference to the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's power to promulgate ordinances is specifically intended for situations when Parliament is *not* in session.  This provision allows for swift legislative action in emergencies or urgent situations.

Statement 2 is correct.  Ordinances issued by the President or Governor lapse automatically six weeks after the commencement of the next session of the relevant legislature (Parliament or state legislature).  This time limit ensures that ordinances do not become permanent laws without proper parliamentary scrutiny.

Statement 3 is incorrect. There are specific exceptions where a Governor cannot issue an ordinance without the President's prior sanction or approval.  These exceptions concern matters that would require presidential assent or those related to bills needing presidential consent for introduction in the state assembly.


**23. Consider the following statements regarding the Secretariats of Parliament:**

1.  Each House of Parliament has a separate secretarial staff, governed by a law passed by Parliament.
2.  The Secretary-Generals of both Houses hold ranks equivalent to Cabinet Secretaries and are placed at the same position in the table of precedence.
3.  The Speaker and Chairman can create new posts in their respective secretariats without any restrictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 98 of the Constitution mandates separate secretarial staffs for each House of Parliament. While Parliament has the power to legislate on recruitment and service conditions for these staffs, no such law has been enacted yet.  However, the constitutional provision establishes the principle of separate secretariats.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Secretary-Generals of both Houses hold ranks equivalent to Cabinet Secretaries, they are not placed at the same position in the table of precedence.  There is a difference in their ranking within the table of precedence.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Speaker and Chairman can create new posts, but there are restrictions.  For Class I and Class II posts, prior consultation with the Union Ministry of Finance is required.  This reflects the budgetary implications of creating new positions.

3. The NHRC possesses powers similar to a civil court, including summoning witnesses and examining documents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC Chairperson and members serve for a term of three years, or until age 70, whichever is earlier.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the President appoints based on recommendations, it's not solely from the Prime Minister.  A committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, but including the Speaker of Lok Sabha, Home Minister, leaders of the opposition, and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, makes the recommendations.  Statement 3 is correct. The NHRC, under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, has extensive powers to investigate human rights violations and enjoys many of the powers of a civil court in the process of investigation. The independence and effectiveness of the NHRC have been subjects of discussion and debate, particularly regarding its ability to investigate cases involving the armed forces.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Agariya tribe's livelihood is intrinsically linked to the Rann of Kutch, and their seasonal migration for salt farming is a well-documented aspect of their culture and the region's ecology.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Rann of Kutch is known for its salt flats, the primary reason for its white appearance is the accumulation of salt, not gypsum. Gypsum deposition might occur in some areas, but it's not the dominant factor contributing to the overall white color of the desert. The seasonal flooding contributes to salt accumulation through evaporation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the 1819 earthquake was a significant event, its impact on the Asiatic Wild Ass's distribution is not the primary or most significant factor affecting its population. Habitat loss due to human activities and changes in salinity are more crucial factors. The earthquake might have caused some localized changes, but it didn't fundamentally reshape the entire region's suitability for the Asiatic Wild Ass.


**2. With reference to the Chilika Lake, consider the following statements:**

1.  Designated as a Ramsar site in 1981, Chilika Lake is the oldest Ramsar site in India and  is located at the mouth of the Mahanadi River.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. La Niña events are characterized by stronger-than-usual trade winds, pushing warmer waters towards the Indonesian coast and cooling the eastern Pacific.
2.  La Niña consistently leads to increased rainfall across all regions of India, resulting in stronger monsoons.
3.  A heat dome is a meteorological phenomenon directly caused by La Niña, resulting in unusually high temperatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key characteristic of La Niña. The strengthening of trade winds redirects warmer surface waters westward, leading to a cooling effect in the eastern Pacific Ocean.  This is a well-established feature of the phenomenon.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While La Niña often does lead to increased rainfall in *most* regions of India, enhancing monsoon strength, it doesn't guarantee increased rainfall *across all* regions. The impact of La Niña on the Indian monsoon is complex and varies regionally; some areas might experience normal or even below-normal rainfall during a La Niña year.  This makes the statement overly broad and inaccurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Heat domes are high-pressure weather systems that trap hot air over a region, leading to prolonged periods of extreme heat. While La Niña can influence global weather patterns and indirectly affect the conditions that could contribute to heat domes (e.g., by altering atmospheric circulation), it is not the *direct* cause of heat dome formation.  Other factors, such as high-pressure systems and specific atmospheric conditions, are primarily responsible for heat domes.  The statement incorrectly links La Niña as a direct cause-and-effect relationship with heat domes.


**2. With reference to El Niño and La Niña, consider the following statements:**

1. El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern, with El Niño characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific.
2. La Niña consistently leads to abnormally heavy monsoons in India and Southeast Asia, while El Niño causes summer droughts over central North America.
3. The 1998 and 1999 hurricane seasons were exceptionally active due to the influence of El Niño.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies El Niño and La Niña as opposing phases of ENSO. El Niño's warm phase in the central and eastern tropical Pacific is contrasted by La Niña's cooler phase. This is fundamental ENSO knowledge.

Statement 2 is partially correct regarding La Niña's impact on monsoons but incorrect regarding El Niño's impact on North American droughts.  While La Niña often enhances monsoon rainfall in India and Southeast Asia, it doesn't always lead to *abnormally heavy* monsoons. The statement oversimplifies the complex relationship. El Niño is often associated with droughts in central North America, but this is not a guaranteed outcome in every El Niño event. Other factors influence drought conditions. Thus, the statement presents an oversimplification.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The exceptionally active hurricane seasons of 1998 and 1999 were primarily associated with La Niña, not El Niño. La Niña's reduced wind shear in the Atlantic creates conditions favourable for hurricane development.  The statement wrongly attributes the effect to El Niño.


**3. With reference to the Atlantic Ocean, consider the following statements:**

1. The average salinity of the Atlantic Ocean is consistently between 34 and 35 parts per thousand.
2.  The Baltic Sea and the North Sea are both marginal seas of the Atlantic Ocean, sharing similar hydrological characteristics.
3. The Amazon River is the largest river system that drains into the Atlantic Ocean, contributing significantly to its overall volume.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The average salinity of the Atlantic Ocean is approximately 36-37 parts per thousand, not 34-35. This is a significant factual error.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While both the Baltic Sea and the North Sea are connected to the Atlantic Ocean, they are not marginal seas in the strictest sense. The Baltic Sea is a brackish inland sea, significantly influenced by river inflow and exhibiting much lower salinity than the Atlantic. The North Sea has a higher salinity than the Baltic but is still distinct from the open Atlantic.  The statement inaccurately depicts them as having similar hydrological characteristics.

Statement 3 is correct. The Amazon River is indeed the largest river system draining into the Atlantic Ocean, contributing a massive amount of freshwater and sediment. This is a well-known geographical fact.


**4. Consider the following statements about the geographical features associated with the Pacific Ring of Fire:**

1. The Pacific Ring of Fire, a horseshoe-shaped region around the Pacific Basin, is characterized by intense tectonic activity, including frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.  Vanuatu is situated within this geologically active zone.
2. The Denali Fault, a major strike-slip fault, forms the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and is known for its significant volcanic activity.
3. The Kerch Strait, located between mainland Russia and Crimea, connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov and is a key route for the export of Russian grain and energy resources.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Pacific Ring of Fire is accurately described, and Vanuatu's location within this zone is a well-established geographical fact. The statement accurately describes the Ring of Fire and correctly places Vanuatu within it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Denali Fault is a major strike-slip fault, but it is primarily a *strike-slip* fault, not a subduction zone.  Strike-slip faults are characterized by horizontal movement of plates, not the subduction (one plate sliding under another) that is associated with the Ring of Fire and volcanic activity. The statement wrongly attributes volcanic activity to the Denali Fault.

Statement 3 is correct. The description of the Kerch Strait, its location, and its significance as a trade route are accurate. The statement correctly describes the Kerch Strait and its importance.


**5. With reference to the Indian Ocean, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Ocean is the smallest of the world's five major ocean basins.
2. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are located within the Indian Ocean.
3. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the world's strongest ocean current, flows eastward through the Southern Ocean, encompassing parts of the Indian Ocean.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Ocean is not the smallest; the Arctic Ocean holds that distinction. This is a clear factual error.

Statement 2 is correct. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are indeed part of the Indian Ocean archipelago. This is a straightforward geographical fact.

Statement 3 is correct. The ACC is accurately described, and its path through the Southern Ocean, including portions of the Indian Ocean, is correct. The statement correctly describes the ACC and its relationship to the Indian Ocean.


**6. With reference to the climate phenomena La Niña and El Niño, consider the following statements:**

1.  El Niño events typically cause a decrease in rainfall across many regions of the world, while La Niña events are associated with increased rainfall in certain areas.
2.  The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle encompasses both El Niño and La Niña events and is primarily driven by changes in atmospheric pressure patterns in the tropical Pacific.
3.  La Niña events are associated with cooler-than-normal temperatures in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and warmer than normal temperatures in South America.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. El Niño is often linked to decreased rainfall in various regions, while La Niña can lead to increased rainfall in other regions. However, the statement oversimplifies the complex and variable effects of these phenomena.  The statement is generally correct but lacks nuance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ENSO does involve both El Niño and La Niña, its primary driver is the interaction between *ocean temperatures* and atmospheric pressure patterns in the tropical Pacific, not solely atmospheric pressure.  The statement incorrectly emphasizes atmospheric pressure as the sole driver.

Statement 3 is partially correct. La Niña does often lead to cooler-than-normal temperatures in parts of the Pacific Northwest. However, its effect on South American temperatures is more complex and variable, not necessarily consistently warmer.   The statement presents an oversimplification of the temperature effects.


**7. With reference to the impact of La Niña on different geographical regions, consider the following statements:**

1. La Niña typically leads to increased risk of flooding and waterlogging in many parts of India due to increased monsoon rainfall.
2. La Niña usually results in cooler temperatures during the post-monsoon and winter months in South-Eastern Africa.
3.  La Niña tends to reduce wind shear in the Atlantic Ocean, thereby creating conditions conducive to the development of stronger Atlantic hurricanes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe key aspects of India's foreign policy. The "Neighbourhood First Policy" emphasizes strong ties with neighboring countries, particularly those in South Asia, for regional stability and cooperation. The "Act East Policy" focuses on strengthening India's engagement with East and Southeast Asian countries and the broader Indo-Pacific region.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  India's non-alignment policy during the Cold War was characterized by its avoidance of formal military alliances with either superpower bloc.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore inaccurate due to their misrepresentation of India's approach to non-alignment and its regional strategies. This question assesses an understanding of the principles and objectives guiding India's foreign policy.

All three statements correctly represent current Indian policy.  Therefore, any option excluding one or more of these is incorrect, demonstrating the need for detailed knowledge of India's energy transition strategy.


**9. With reference to the Indian financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is responsible for regulating and supervising all aspects of the Indian banking sector, including both public and private banks.
2.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the primary regulator for the Indian securities market, overseeing stock exchanges, mutual funds, and other market participants.
3. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) regulates and develops the insurance sector and directly reports to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the roles of the RBI and SEBI in the Indian financial system. The RBI is the central bank of India and acts as the apex regulator for the banking sector. SEBI is the regulator of the securities market. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The IRDAI, while regulating the insurance sector, reports to the Ministry of Finance, not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the regulatory structure of the Indian financial sector.  This question tests knowledge of the functions and jurisdictions of key regulatory bodies.


**10. With reference to India's engagement with international organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. India is a founding member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and plays a significant role in its governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. India is a founding member of the ADB and holds significant voting power within the organization.  India is also a member of the FATF, actively participating in its efforts to combat financial crimes.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While India has faced trade disputes within the WTO framework, it has not been subject to formal trade sanctions by the WTO itself. This question tests the knowledge of India’s participation in and relationship with different global organizations.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to their inaccurate representation of India's relationship with the WTO and the FATF.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the prize does include a monetary award of ₹25 lakh and a citation, the text clearly mentions that recipients are chosen from a pool of *national and international* nominees, not solely Indian nominees. This is a crucial detail that distinguishes the award's scope.

Statement 3 is correct. The 2023 award was jointly given to Daniel Barenboim and Ali Abu Awwad for their work in bringing together Israeli and Arab youth for peaceful conflict resolution. The text supports this fact.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false statement 2 or exclude the true statements 1 and/or 3.


**2. With reference to the Padma Shri award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Padma Shri is the country's highest civilian award, conferred annually.
2.  Tulsi Gowda, a renowned environmentalist, was awarded the Padma Shri in 2021 for her exceptional contribution to afforestation.
3.  The Padma Shri is awarded only to Indian citizens residing within India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Padma Shri is a high civilian award but it is not the *highest*. The text mentions it as the country's fourth-highest civilian award.  This is a key detail that distinguishes it from other national honors.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that Tulsi Gowda received the Padma Shri in 2021 for her significant afforestation work.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text does not specify any residency requirement for the Padma Shri award.  The eligibility criteria for awards can vary and often depend on the specific award's guidelines, which are not detailed in the text.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include false statements about the Padma Shri's ranking and/or eligibility.


**3. With reference to notifiable diseases, consider the following statements:**

2.  Notifiable diseases are those that healthcare providers are legally required to report to local health clinics only.
3.  The World Health Organization's International Health Regulations (IHR) mandate the reporting of all disease outbreaks to the WHO.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that India has recently declared snakebite a notifiable disease to improve surveillance and intervention efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Notifiable diseases require reporting to *public health authorities*, which is a broader category than just local health clinics.  The reporting mechanism involves a wider network for better disease management at the national level.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the IHR does require countries to report certain disease outbreaks, it doesn't mandate the reporting of *all* outbreaks. The specific diseases and events covered under the IHR are defined in the regulations themselves.

Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include false statements about the reporting mechanism for notifiable diseases and the scope of the WHO's IHR.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The China-Plus-One strategy involves diversifying operations *outside* China, but it's not limited to ASEAN countries. The text mentions India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia as potential destinations, showcasing a broader geographical scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly defines the China-Plus-One strategy as a diversification approach to reduce reliance on China and mitigate associated risks.  This is the core principle of the strategy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text lists market diversification and greater global supply chain participation as benefits. It also explicitly includes *technology transfer* as a benefit.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect statements about the geographical scope of the strategy and its benefits, particularly regarding technology transfer.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only

Statement 2 is incorrect. The theme for World Soil Day 2024, according to the text, is "Caring for Soils: Measure, Monitor, Manage," not "Protect Our Soils: The Foundation of Life."  This demonstrates the importance of paying close attention to detail in the question.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) introduced the concept in 2002, and the FAO endorsed it in 2013. The FAO's endorsement was a crucial step, but the initial concept originated earlier with the IUSS.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct. The other options are incorrect because they include false statements about the awarding body and the monetary value of the Akademi Fellow award.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', leveraging misleading information and plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements about the World Health Organization (WHO):**

1. The WHO declared Jordan as a malaria-free country in 2023, following a rigorous eradication campaign.
2.  The WHO's S.A.R.A.H. software is primarily used for contact tracing and managing COVID-19 outbreaks.
3. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), a WHO partner, primarily focuses on food safety standards, including Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the WHO does certify malaria-free countries,  Belize, not Jordan, received this certification.  The WHO’s World Malaria Report highlights significant progress in malaria reduction in various countries, including India, but doesn't mention Jordan achieving malaria-free status in 2023.  The statement incorrectly attributes a WHO action to Jordan.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the WHO *does* use software for various purposes, including disease surveillance and response,  S.A.R.A.H. is not specifically tied to COVID-19 contact tracing.  The software's functions are broader than the statement suggests.  Attributing a specific function to a particular software without complete knowledge is a common distractor technique.

Statement 3 is correct. The WHO collaborates closely with the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) on food safety and standards.  The CAC's work encompasses GMP, ensuring food safety standards are met globally. This is a well-established fact requiring factual recall.  The question uses the close relationship between WHO and CAC to create a plausible distractor.


**2. With reference to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The WHO's report on "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)"  concludes that water-borne diseases are the leading cause of death globally.
2. The WHO warns against the use of e-cigarettes due to their potential to cause Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), a rare blood clotting disorder.
3. The WHO partnered in issuing the COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate and Health, which emphasizes the link between climate change and health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The WHO's WASH report highlights the significant burden of disease from unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene, but it doesn’t definitively state that water-borne diseases are the *leading* cause of death globally.  Many other causes of death exist, making this statement an overgeneralization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the WHO does warn about the harms of e-cigarettes, it primarily focuses on their addictive nature and the long-term health risks, rather than a specific link to TTS.  TTS is associated with certain vaccines, not necessarily e-cigarettes. This statement interchanges the cause and effect relationship.

Statement 3 is correct. The WHO's active engagement in global health initiatives is well-known. The participation in the COP28 declaration reflects its concern about the impact of climate change on health outcomes. This statement tests factual recall and requires understanding of the WHO's role in international collaborations.


**3. With reference to the World Health Organization (WHO), consider the following statements:**

1. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is an independent organization separate from the WHO.
2. The WHO defines Good Manufacturing Practices (WHO-GMP) standards for pharmaceuticals and related products, ensuring quality and safety.
3. The WHO's Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative focuses primarily on early detection and treatment through advanced surgical techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IARC is *part* of the WHO, not an independent organization.  It operates under the WHO's umbrella, specializing in cancer research.  This statement tests factual knowledge about the organizational structure of the WHO.

Statement 2 is correct. The WHO indeed sets WHO-GMP standards, crucial for pharmaceutical quality and safety.  This is a key aspect of the WHO's mandate and is a fact requiring direct recall.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While early detection and treatment are components of the WHO's cervical cancer initiative, the emphasis is on prevention through vaccination and screening, not necessarily advanced surgical techniques. This statement gives a misleading description of the initiative's focus.  The question uses the partial truth to create a difficult distractor.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding global health organizations:**

1. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the WHO collaborate on projects related to noise pollution control.
2. The WHO approves the Mosquirix malaria vaccine for use in high-transmission areas.
3.  The World Health Organization (WHO) released sodium benchmarks to guide countries in reducing sodium intake.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although both the OECD and WHO are concerned with public health, their collaboration doesn't specifically focus on noise pollution. The WHO's role in noise pollution regulation is independent of the OECD. This statement creates a false interdisciplinary linkage.

Statement 2 is correct. The WHO plays a key role in vaccine approval and recommendation for global use. Mosquirix is a notable example of a malaria vaccine they have approved. This is a fact that demands direct recall.

Statement 3 is correct. The WHO actively works to improve global health through the release of various guidelines and standards, including benchmarks for sodium intake to address public health concerns related to high sodium consumption. This is an example of the WHO's role in setting global health standards.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring specific factual knowledge and analytical skills to differentiate between correct and incorrect information masked by plausible distractors.  Remember, the difficulty lies in the subtle inaccuracies and misleading information presented in the incorrect options.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Silk Road primarily facilitated the export of raw silk from China to the Roman Empire, significantly impacting the latter's textile industry.
2.  China's porcelain exports, renowned for their intricate designs and durability, reached European markets via various trade routes, including the Silk Road.
3.  The introduction of paper manufacturing technology from China revolutionized writing and record-keeping practices across Eurasia, significantly impacting administrative and scholarly activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The Silk Road was instrumental in the global dissemination of Chinese goods, including raw silk and porcelain.  The significant impact of silk on the Roman textile industry is well-documented. Similarly, the high demand and widespread adoption of Chinese porcelain in Europe demonstrate the extensive reach of its trade networks.  The introduction of papermaking technology from China represents a major technological transfer that profoundly impacted the spread of knowledge and administrative efficiency across various regions. While other goods were also traded, the statements accurately reflect the significant role of silk and porcelain in the Chinese export economy and the transformative influence of paper manufacturing technology.


**2. With reference to the historical and cultural interactions between China and India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The spread of Buddhism from India to China was a gradual process, spanning centuries and facilitated by numerous religious missions and scholarly exchanges.
2.  The Qarachil expedition, a significant military campaign, established direct political control over parts of Central Asia, thereby solidifying China's influence in the region and impacting its relations with India.
3.  Indian textiles were a major export to China during various historical periods, reflecting the extensive trade networks and cultural exchanges between the two civilizations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The spread of Buddhism from India to China involved numerous monks, texts, and cultural exchanges over many centuries, shaping religious and philosophical landscapes in China.  Extensive trade between India and China involved various goods, with Indian textiles being a significant export. The Qarachil expedition is not as directly linked to Sino-Indian relations as the other two statements.  While it did impact China's regional influence, its direct impact on the relationship with India is less well-established compared to the spread of Buddhism and the trade in textiles.


**3. With reference to China's geographical features and their impact on its environment and economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Yangtze River, one of the longest rivers in the world, is crucial for China's agriculture, transportation, and hydropower generation, significantly contributing to the nation's economic development.
2.  The Taklamakan Desert, a vast arid region in western China, poses challenges to agriculture and infrastructure development, but also holds potential for renewable energy projects like solar power.
3.  The ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) phenomenon directly and consistently causes severe floods across all regions of China, impacting agricultural yields and infrastructure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The Yangtze River plays a vital role in China's economy and society. The Taklamakan Desert, while posing challenges, also presents opportunities.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While ENSO can influence weather patterns in China and potentially contribute to flooding in some areas, it does not consistently cause severe floods across all regions. The impact of ENSO varies regionally and is not the sole or consistent cause of flooding in China. Other factors such as monsoonal rains and dam management play significant roles.


**4. With reference to China's economic reforms and their impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  China's economic reforms, initiated in 1978 under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, focused primarily on the industrial sector, rapidly transforming it into a global manufacturing powerhouse.
2.  The dismantling of the commune system and the implementation of the household responsibility system in the agricultural sector were crucial steps in China's economic reforms, leading to increased agricultural output.
3. The "Made in China 2025" initiative aimed to reduce China's dependence on foreign technology and enhance its global competitiveness in high-tech manufacturing,  resulting in a significant shift towards a service-based economy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  China's economic reforms began with agricultural reforms, including the dismantling of the commune system and the introduction of the household responsibility system. This led to increased agricultural productivity and laid the groundwork for further economic reforms. While the industrial sector was also significantly reformed, the agricultural reforms were foundational. Statement 3 is partially incorrect. "Made in China 2025" aimed to enhance high-tech manufacturing competitiveness, but it did *not* result in a significant shift towards a service-based economy; China's economy still heavily relies on manufacturing.


**5. With reference to China's foreign relations and geopolitical standing, consider the following statements:**

1.  China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly expanded its geopolitical influence across Eurasia and Africa, fostering economic partnerships and infrastructure projects.
2.  China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea, particularly concerning the Spratly and Paracel Islands, have led to increased regional tensions and conflicts with neighboring countries.
3.  China's military buildup in the South China Sea, including the construction of artificial islands and deployment of military assets, has significantly diminished the influence of ASEAN in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The BRI has undeniably expanded China's influence.  China's claims in the South China Sea have generated significant tension. Statement 3 is an overstatement. While China's actions have challenged ASEAN's influence, it hasn't entirely diminished it. ASEAN continues to be a significant regional player, albeit one facing considerable pressure from China's assertive actions.  ASEAN members have attempted to navigate a complex relationship with China, balancing economic ties with concerns over regional security.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Santhal Rebellion:**

1.  The rebellion was primarily a response to the economic hardships imposed by the Permanent Settlement of Bengal.
2.  Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu were prominent leaders who spearheaded the rebellion against the British East India Company.
3. The rebellion was confined to the region of present-day Bihar, with minimal impact on neighboring areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the Permanent Settlement Act of 1793 did contribute to the economic distress faced by the Santhals, leading to their displacement and exploitation, it wasn't the sole cause.  Other factors like the encroachment of their lands by landlords and moneylenders also played a significant role in igniting the rebellion.  The statement oversimplifies the complex socio-economic factors that fueled the uprising.

Statement 2 is correct. Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu were indeed the key leaders of the Santhal Rebellion. Their leadership galvanized the Santhal community against the oppressive British colonial rule and the exploitative practices of the zamindari system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion wasn't confined to present-day Bihar.  It extended to the Birbhum and Manbhum regions (present-day West Bengal) and significantly impacted the Damin-i-Koh region in the Rajmahal Hills of Jharkhand. The rebellion's geographical reach was much broader than the statement suggests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Warli painting is indeed associated with the tribal communities of Maharashtra. The distinctive style uses white poster color on a red or black background, depicting scenes from daily life and nature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Madhubani paintings are known for their intricate details and vibrant colors, they are traditionally painted on walls, and later on handmade paper, not cloth.  The use of cloth as a medium is not a defining characteristic of this art form.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Basohli painting is a style of Pahari painting, originating in the hills of Jammu and Kashmir, not Tamil Nadu. The association of Basohli painting with Tamil Nadu is a complete geographical misattribution.


**3. With reference to the Rampa Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alluri Sitarama Raju, known as the "Manyam Veerudu," led the Rampa Rebellion in 1922.
2.  The rebellion was primarily aimed at opposing the British government's revenue policies and forest laws in the Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh.
3.  Alluri Sitarama Raju's leadership was significantly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alluri Sitarama Raju was the charismatic leader of the Rampa Rebellion, a tribal uprising in the Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh.  His courageous leadership and defiance earned him the title "Manyam Veerudu" (Hero of the Jungles).

Statement 2 is correct.  The rebellion was primarily a reaction against the British government's oppressive revenue policies and the stringent forest laws that restricted the access of tribal communities to their traditional forest resources. These policies led to widespread discontent and fueled the rebellion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Alluri Sitarama Raju used some tactics inspired by Gandhi's philosophy, his methods were far from purely non-violent. The rebellion involved armed resistance against the British authorities.  The statement oversimplifies the complex nature of his leadership and the rebellion's tactics.


**4. With reference to the Kartarpur Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The corridor was inaugurated in 2014 to commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
2.  It facilitates visa-free access for Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the Darbar Sahib Gurdwara in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
3. The corridor connects the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan, to Gurudwara Dera Baba Nanak in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kartarpur Corridor was inaugurated in 2019, not 2014, to commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. The date is a crucial detail often missed.

Statement 2 is correct.  The primary purpose of the Kartarpur Corridor is to provide visa-free access for Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the Darbar Sahib Gurdwara, a significant religious site located in Kartarpur, Pakistan. This initiative aimed to facilitate religious tourism and enhance people-to-people contact.

Statement 3 is correct. The corridor directly links the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan, to Gurudwara Dera Baba Nanak in India, making it easier for pilgrims to travel between the two sites.  This geographical connection is essential to understanding the corridor's function.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, a key figure in the Indian Renaissance, did indeed author the book "Gift to Monotheists," which reflected his reformist ideas and his efforts to promote monotheistic beliefs.

Statement 2 is correct. Swami Vivekananda played a crucial role in introducing Vedanta philosophy to the West, significantly increasing its global reach and influence. His speeches and writings helped shape the understanding of this philosophical school of thought worldwide.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Debendranath Tagore was a significant figure in the Brahmo Samaj movement and a key contributor to religious and social reform, his primary contributions were not in the field of painting.  His son, Rabindranath Tagore, is much more widely recognized for his artistic achievements in literature and painting.


**6. With reference to socio-cultural reform movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Servants of India Society was founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale.
2.  The Social Service League was established by Narayan Malhar Joshi in Bombay.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent Indian leader and social reformer, founded the Servants of India Society, an organization dedicated to social service and the advancement of India's political and social progress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Social Service League was indeed established in Bombay, but its founder was Narayan Malhar Joshi, not Behramji M. Malabari.  The founders of these organizations are often confused, requiring careful recall.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Behramji M. Malabari was a significant social reformer who championed the cause of women, he did not found Seva Sadan. That organization was founded by another reformer, often overlooked in standard accounts.


**7. Consider the following statements about the UNESCO City of Literature program:**

1. The program solely focuses on the number of literary works produced in a city to determine eligibility for designation.
2.  The program aims to foster international cooperation and the exchange of literary expertise among cities.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNESCO City of Literature program doesn't solely rely on the quantitative measure of literary works produced. It considers a range of factors, including the vibrancy of the literary scene, the presence of literary institutions, and the city's contribution to literature.

Statement 2 is correct. A core objective of the program is to promote international collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and best practices among cities with thriving literary scenes. This networking aspect is key to the program's success.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While a rich literary history is often a factor, the program doesn't exclude cities with relatively newer but dynamic literary communities. The criteria are more holistic than a simple historical assessment.


**8. With reference to the National Flag of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ashoka Chakra in the center of the flag is a replica of the wheel on the abacus of Ashoka's Sarnath Lion Capital.
2.  The flag's dimensions are specified in the ratio of 2:3 (length to width).
3. Article 51A of the Constitution of India mandates respect for the National Flag.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ashoka Chakra featured in the Indian National Flag is a precise replica of the wheel appearing on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion Capital, a significant historical artifact. This connection underscores the historical and symbolic significance of the flag's design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The correct ratio of the Indian National Flag is 3:2 (length to width), not 2:3. This seemingly minor detail is important for accurate flag representation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Constitution emphasizes the importance of respecting the National Flag, the specific mandate for this respect is found in Part IV-A, Article 51A, which deals with Fundamental Duties, not a specific article number. The statement incorrectly cites the article number.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's primary objective was the complete boycott of British goods and institutions.
2.  The Chauri Chaura incident directly led to the suspension of the movement.
3.  The Khilafat Movement played a crucial role in galvanizing Muslim participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Non-Cooperation Movement involved boycotts, its primary objective was Swaraj (self-rule), achieved through non-cooperation with British rule, encompassing various aspects beyond just boycotts.  The movement aimed for a complete withdrawal of cooperation from British institutions and systems, but this was not limited to a mere boycott of goods.  The strategy included the renunciation of titles, resignation from government jobs, and the boycott of educational institutions and courts.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, where a police station was attacked and several policemen killed, significantly impacted Mahatma Gandhi's decision to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement. The violence was a stark departure from the movement's philosophy of non-violence, prompting Gandhi to reassess the strategy and its effectiveness. The suspension aimed to prevent further escalation of violence and maintain the movement's non-violent approach.

Statement 3 is correct. The Khilafat Movement, focused on protecting the Ottoman Caliphate, played a significant role in uniting Hindus and Muslims within the Non-Cooperation Movement. The shared cause of opposing British imperialism and defending religious freedom brought together diverse groups, significantly increasing the movement's reach and participation across different religious communities in India. The convergence of these two movements demonstrated a powerful force of combined mobilization.


**2. With reference to the personalities involved in the Indian Independence Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chandra Shekhar Azad was primarily known for his association with the Hindustan Republican Army and his participation in the Kakori Conspiracy.
2.  Ram Prasad Bismil was a key figure in the Non-Cooperation Movement, known for his strong advocacy for Swaraj.
3.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a strong proponent of Swaraj, launched the weeklies Kesari and Mahratta to criticize British policies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chandra Shekhar Azad's prominent role was within the Hindustan Republican Association (later Hindustan Socialist Republican Association), a revolutionary organization focused on armed struggle. His involvement in the Kakori Train Robbery is well documented, demonstrating his commitment to armed resistance against British rule.  His leadership and dedication to the revolutionary cause solidified his place in the history of the Indian Independence movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ram Prasad Bismil participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement, he wasn't primarily known for his advocacy of Swaraj within that specific context. His most significant contributions stemmed from his involvement in revolutionary activities and the Hindustan Republican Association, notably the Kakori Conspiracy.  His contributions to the Non-Cooperation Movement were less prominent than his revolutionary activities.

Statement 3 is correct. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a leading figure in the Indian Independence Movement and a significant advocate for Swaraj. He strategically utilized his newspapers, Kesari (Marathi) and Mahratta (English), as platforms to criticize British policies, mobilize public opinion, and foster nationalist sentiment. This demonstrated his ability to use media as a powerful tool for political mobilization and resistance.


**3. With reference to the Lingayats, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lingayats are a Vaishnavite sect within Hinduism, primarily concentrated in the southern part of India.
2.  They are known for their rejection of the Vedic scriptures and the caste system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lingayats are a Shaivite sect, not Vaishnavite.  They worship Shiva, and their beliefs and practices are rooted in Shaivism. While geographically concentrated in South India, their origins trace back to the Kannada region.  Attributing them to Vaishnavism is a significant historical inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. A defining characteristic of the Lingayat faith is its rejection of the Vedic scriptures and the traditional Hindu caste system. This rejection stems from their belief in a more egalitarian society and a direct path to salvation through devotion to Shiva. The rejection of the caste system is a fundamental aspect of their socio-religious identity.

Statement 3 is correct. Basavanna, a 12th-century social reformer and philosopher, is widely recognized as the founder of the Lingayat movement (also known as Virashaivism). His teachings emphasized social equality, devotion to Shiva, and the rejection of caste distinctions, forming the core tenets of the Lingayat faith.  His influence on the development of the Lingayat movement is undeniable and well-established in historical accounts.


**4. With reference to the Vishnupad Temple, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vishnupad Temple is located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, on the banks of the Falgu River, not the Ganges. While it holds religious significance and attracts many pilgrims, it is not currently designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The location on the Falgu River is a key geographical detail often overlooked in general descriptions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar significantly contributed to the temple's restoration and renovation, she did not order its original construction. The temple's origins predate her era considerably, with historical accounts pointing to its establishment much earlier.  Attributing its construction solely to her is a significant historical inaccuracy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vishnupad Temple is primarily dedicated to the worship of Lord Vishnu, not Shiva.  The temple's name itself, "Vishnupad," signifies this dedication.  The confusion may arise from the presence of other religious structures and deities in the vicinity of the temple.


**5. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple is situated to the west of the Mahabodhi Tree, where the Buddha attained enlightenment.
2.  It was built by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE.
3.  The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple stands to the *east*, not west, of the Mahabodhi Tree. This is a crucial detail regarding the temple's spatial relationship to the sacred tree.  The directional aspect is often overlooked in general descriptions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Emperor Ashoka established a significant pillar and other structures at Bodh Gaya, the present Mahabodhi Temple is not his construction. The existing structure is a later construction, with multiple phases of building and renovation spanning centuries.  Assigning the construction solely to Ashoka is a significant historical inaccuracy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mahabodhi Temple complex at Bodh Gaya, Bihar, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Its recognition by UNESCO highlights its global cultural and religious importance.  This designation is a significant fact to remember for UPSC examinations.


**6.  With reference to Tell Umm Amer (Saint Hilarion Monastery) in Palestine, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is located near major trade routes between Asia and Europe, contributing to its historical significance.
2.  The site's inscription on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger is primarily due to its vulnerability to natural disasters.
3.  The monastery dates back to the 4th century CE, making it one of the earliest monastic sites in the Middle East.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Tell Umm Amer's location near major trade routes connecting Asia and Africa (not Europe) is a key factor in its historical and strategic importance. The monastery's proximity to these routes facilitated cultural exchange and economic activity throughout its history.  The specification of Asia and Africa as opposed to Europe is a vital detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the site faces threats, its inclusion on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger is primarily due to its proximity to major trade and communication routes between Asia and Africa, leading to potential damage from development and conflict, not primarily natural disasters.  This highlights the complex interplay between cultural heritage preservation and geopolitical realities.

Statement 3 is correct.  Tell Umm Amer (Saint Hilarion Monastery) dates back to the 4th century CE, representing one of the earliest monastic sites in the Middle East. Its early establishment underscores the region's significant role in the development of early Christianity and monastic traditions.  This early date is a key fact to remember for historical context.


**7. With reference to Humayun's Tomb, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is considered a precursor to the Taj Mahal in terms of architectural style and design.
2.  It was built by Humayun's wife, Hamida Banu Begum, after his death.
3.  The tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Agra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Humayun's Tomb significantly influenced later Mughal architecture, particularly the Taj Mahal.  Its garden-tomb design, use of red sandstone, and symmetrical layout established architectural precedents that were later adopted and refined in subsequent Mughal structures.  This architectural lineage is a key aspect of its significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Hamida Banu Begum commissioned the construction of Humayun's Tomb, attributing it solely to her overlooks Akbar's significant role in its completion.  Akbar, Humayun's son, oversaw the project's completion, and the tomb's final form reflects his involvement.  This demonstrates the collaborative nature of Mughal architectural projects.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Humayun's Tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but it is located in Delhi, not Agra.  The confusion might stem from Agra's association with other significant Mughal structures.  The precise location is crucial for geographical accuracy.


**8. With reference to the  Madhubani paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. Madhubani paintings are characterized by their use of bright colors and geometrical patterns, primarily depicting scenes from the Mahabharata.
2.  The paintings are primarily practiced in the Madhubani district of Bihar.
3.  These paintings gained national recognition in the 1960s.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Madhubani paintings do use bright colors and geometrical patterns, their subject matter is broader than just the Mahabharata. They also depict scenes from the Ramayana, Hindu deities, flora, fauna, and aspects of daily life. The focus on only the Mahabharata is a misleading simplification.

Statement 2 is correct.  Madhubani paintings are primarily practiced in the Madhubani district of Bihar.  This geographical location is a key identifying characteristic of this art form.  The name itself gives a clear indication of its origin.

Statement 3 is correct. Madhubani paintings gained national recognition in the 1970s, not the 1960s, following their wider exposure and appreciation. This recognition marked a significant turning point in the art form's history, leading to its increased popularity and preservation efforts. The slight chronological inaccuracy serves as a distractor.


**9. With reference to the  Warli paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. Warli paintings primarily use natural pigments and are characterized by their depiction of geometric patterns and rural life.
2. The paintings are primarily practiced by the Warli tribe of the Western Ghats region in Maharashtra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Warli paintings traditionally utilize natural pigments derived from plants and minerals.  The style is characterized by its unique geometric patterns, representing aspects of the Warli tribe's lifestyle, social structure, and beliefs concerning nature and rural life.  The use of natural pigments is a key feature often highlighted.

Statement 2 is correct. Warli paintings are primarily practiced by the Warli tribe inhabiting the North Sahyadri Range (part of the Western Ghats) in Maharashtra.  This strong tribal association is a defining characteristic of the art form. The tribal origin is a significant element in understanding the art's cultural context.

Statement 3 is correct. Warli paintings gained significant international recognition in the late 1970s, bringing them wider exposure and appreciation.  This period marked a crucial turning point in the art's history, leading to its increased preservation and promotion.  The timeframe of recognition is a detail often missed in generalized accounts.



**10. With reference to the  Basohli paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. Basohli paintings are characterized by their use of vibrant primary colors and a distinct facial formula, primarily depicting scenes from the Ramayana.
2.  The paintings originated in the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas during the 17th and 18th centuries.
3. These paintings are recognized for their incorporation of Persian and Mughal artistic influences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Basohli paintings do utilize vibrant primary colors and feature a distinct facial formula, their subject matter is not limited to the Ramayana. They also depict scenes from other epics like the Mahabharata, as well as various mythological and romantic narratives. The restriction to only the Ramayana is a misleading detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Basohli paintings originated in the foothills of the *Western*, not Eastern Himalayas, in the Jammu region during the 17th and early 18th centuries. This geographical location is crucial for understanding the art's regional context and stylistic development.  The directional inaccuracy is a common point of confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. Basohli paintings demonstrate a clear blending of Persian and Mughal artistic influences, evident in their composition, color palettes, and the depiction of figures and landscapes. This fusion of styles reflects the historical and cultural exchanges in the region during that period.  The influence of other artistic traditions is a key aspect of the paintings' stylistic development.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The caves were built around the 2nd century BCE, not the 1st century CE. The provided text clearly states the 2nd century BCE construction period. Statement 2 is correct. The number of original caves and the surviving ones are accurately stated, along with their distribution between Udayagiri and Khandagiri hills.  Statement 3 is incorrect.

The text clearly states the inauguration year and its connection to Guru Nanak Dev's birth anniversary. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gurdwara Darbar Sahib is located in Pakistan, on the west bank of the River Ravi, while Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak in India is located about 1 km from the border on the east bank of the Ravi.

**1. With reference to the Amazon rainforest and its ecosystem, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Amazon rainforest primarily receives its essential nutrients from the Sahara Desert through atmospheric transport.
2.  Forest fires, a significant natural disaster, severely impact the Amazon rainforest ecosystem, leading to biodiversity loss and habitat destruction.
3.  The Amazon rainforest is entirely contained within the geographical boundaries of Brazil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While atmospheric transport plays a role in nutrient cycling in the Amazon, the primary source of nutrients is the decomposition of organic matter within the rainforest itself, along with riverine inputs.  The Sahara Desert's contribution, while a subject of ongoing research, is not the primary source.  The Amazon's nutrient cycling is a complex interplay of several factors, not solely dependent on distant sources.

Statement 2 is correct.  Forest fires are a major threat to the Amazon rainforest, causing widespread habitat loss, impacting biodiversity, and releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  These fires are often exacerbated by human activities such as deforestation and agricultural practices. The devastating consequences are well-documented in scientific literature.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Amazon rainforest spans across multiple countries, including Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.  It is not limited to Brazil alone.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Peru does possess significant zinc reserves and zinc production is a part of its economy, these reserves are not primarily located within the Amazon basin.  Peru's mineral wealth is distributed across various regions.  The Amazon basin is known more for its biodiversity and timber resources than for large-scale zinc mining.

Statement 2 is correct. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) significantly impacts Peru's climate, particularly the coastal and Andean regions.  The Amazon rainforest, while less directly affected than other regions, experiences variations in rainfall patterns and temperatures due to El Niño events, leading to ecological consequences.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Chile and Peru share a land border, they do not share a maritime border. Their maritime boundaries are defined by international agreements.


**3. With reference to the geographical location of the Amazon rainforest, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Amazon rainforest is entirely located within the South American continent, encompassing a vast area of Brazil.
2.  The city of Lima, the capital of Peru, is situated within the Amazon rainforest, making it a significant urban center in this biome.
3.  The Amazon rainforest receives nutrients from the Sahara Desert through long-distance atmospheric dust transport.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the majority of the Amazon rainforest lies within South America, a significant portion extends into other countries beyond Brazil. The statement is overly simplistic and inaccurate in its geographic scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lima, Peru's capital, is located on the Pacific coast, far from the Amazon rainforest.  It is not an urban center within the Amazon biome.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While research indicates some nutrient transfer from the Sahara Desert to the Amazon, this is not the primary means by which the rainforest receives its nutrients.  The statement overstates the significance of this phenomenon.  The Amazon's nutrient cycle is primarily driven by internal processes and river systems.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Amazon basin:**

1.  The Amazon basin contains the entirety of the Amazon rainforest, with no portion of the rainforest extending beyond its boundaries.
2.  Northern Chad's geographical location contributes significantly to the nutrient cycle of the Amazon rainforest through atmospheric dust deposition.
3.  Peru's zinc production, fueled by its substantial zinc reserves, is largely dependent on mining operations within the Amazon rainforest.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None of the statements is correct


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Amazon rainforest extends beyond the boundaries of the Amazon basin into several neighboring countries. The basin encompasses a larger area that includes the rainforest, but the rainforest itself is not wholly contained within the basin.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sahara Desert contributes to the Amazon's nutrient cycle through atmospheric dust, Northern Chad's specific contribution is not a major factor compared to the overall Saharan dust transport. The statement is too geographically precise and lacks sufficient evidence.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Peru's zinc reserves and production are not primarily located within the Amazon rainforest.  Mining activities are concentrated in other regions of the country.  The statement creates a false connection between zinc production and the Amazon rainforest within Peru.


**5.  With reference to the impact of human activities on the Amazon rainforest, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amazon rainforest's biodiversity is primarily threatened by the overexploitation of its zinc reserves.
2.  Political instability in Peru negatively impacts the conservation efforts aimed at protecting the Amazon rainforest within its borders.
3.  The Amazon rainforest is entirely unaffected by the upwelling oceanic process off the coast of Peru.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Amazon rainforest's biodiversity is threatened by deforestation, agricultural expansion, mining (of various minerals, not just zinc), and climate change.  While mining does contribute to environmental degradation, it is not the primary threat to biodiversity.  The statement focuses on a minor factor and ignores the larger picture of deforestation and habitat loss.

Statement 2 is correct. Political instability in countries like Peru can hinder effective governance and resource management, including conservation efforts in the Amazon rainforest.  Lack of political stability can lead to reduced enforcement of environmental regulations and increased illegal activities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Upwelling, a process where nutrient-rich waters rise to the surface, influences the marine ecosystem off Peru's coast.  This process affects the climate and weather patterns that impact the Amazon rainforest's ecosystem, albeit indirectly.  The statement falsely assumes a complete lack of interaction.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation exceeding 100 words.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Erez crossing, a crucial transit point connecting Gaza and the West Bank, experienced significant restrictions on Palestinian movement during periods of heightened conflict.
2.  The Rafah crossing, primarily managed by Egypt, serves as an alternative border point for Gaza, offering limited access to the outside world.
3.  The Palestinian Authority (PA), while having limited governance over parts of Gaza, retains full administrative control over its borders and crossings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Erez crossing, situated on the border between Israel and Gaza, has historically been a major point of contention and control.  During times of conflict or heightened tensions, Israel frequently imposes restrictions on the movement of Palestinians through this crossing, impacting access for humanitarian aid, commerce, and personal travel between Gaza and the West Bank.  The level of restriction varies depending on the security situation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Rafah crossing, situated on the border between Gaza and Egypt, provides an alternative route for Palestinians.  However, its operation is often subject to the political relations between Egypt and the Palestinian factions controlling Gaza, particularly Hamas.  Unlike the Erez crossing, Egypt's control over Rafah is more direct, but the crossing is not consistently open, leading to limitations on the movement of people and goods.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Palestinian Authority (PA) has had a complex and often contested relationship with Hamas regarding control over Gaza.  While the PA has nominal authority, Hamas, the de facto governing entity in Gaza, exercises significant control over its internal affairs, including border security and crossing management.  The PA's influence on the Rafah crossing is limited.  Therefore, the PA does not retain full control over Gaza's borders and crossings.


**2. With reference to the Indian Armed Forces, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) primarily focuses on the construction and maintenance of roads in border areas, with limited involvement in supporting the Indian Armed Forces.
2.  The Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) manages and promotes sports activities within the Indian Armed Forces, playing a significant role in their overall well-being and morale.
3. The Indian Armed Forces have recently adopted the "Drone, Detect, Deter and Destroy (D4 System)" anti-drone system to counter emerging threats in multi-domain operations, but not other countermeasures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is a crucial organization that plays a vital role in supporting the Indian Armed Forces. While it primarily focuses on the construction and maintenance of roads and other infrastructure in border areas, its activities are directly linked to enhancing the mobility and operational capabilities of the armed forces in strategically important regions.

3.  India's dominance in the global jute market is primarily due to its substantial exports of raw jute rather than jute goods.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jute is a Kharif crop, meaning its cultivation is primarily associated with the monsoon season (June-October).

The specific climatic conditions required for jute, including high humidity and rainfall, are characteristic of the Kharif season.

Statement 2 is correct. Jute thrives in hot and humid climatic conditions with abundant rainfall.  These conditions are necessary for its growth and development.  The crop requires significant moisture throughout its growing period.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While India is a major exporter of raw jute, its overall dominance in the global jute market is also significantly due to its substantial exports of jute goods.  India possesses a significant jute manufacturing industry that processes raw jute into a wide range of products, which are then exported internationally.  Both raw jute and jute goods contribute to India's global market position.


**5. With reference to the Economic Survey of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Economic Survey is prepared annually by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) and presented to the Parliament.
2.  The first Economic Survey was presented in 1950-51, providing an overview of the Indian economy.
3.  The Economic Survey primarily focuses on macroeconomic indicators, with minimal attention to social development aspects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Economic Survey of India is prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, not the MOSPI.  The MOSPI is responsible for collecting and compiling statistical data, but the analysis and interpretation presented in the Economic Survey fall under the purview of the Ministry of Finance.

Statement 2 is correct. The first Economic Survey was indeed presented in 1950-51. It marked the beginning of a regular practice of providing an annual overview and assessment of the Indian economy's performance and prospects.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While macroeconomic indicators form a core part of the Economic Survey, it also includes analysis of various social development indicators such as health, education, poverty, and inequality.  A comprehensive assessment of the economy requires an integrated approach that considers both economic and social aspects.  The survey provides a holistic perspective on India's development trajectory.



**6. With reference to  'zombie startups', consider the following statements:**

1. Zombie startups are characterized by consistent profitability despite low revenue generation.
2.  They often continue operations due to continued access to external funding, even if they are not commercially viable.
3. A "funding winter" typically leads to the immediate closure of all startups, irrespective of their financial health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Zombie startups, by definition, are not consistently profitable. They are characterized by their inability to generate sufficient revenue to cover their operating costs and debt obligations.  Their continued existence despite this financial distress is the defining feature of a "zombie" entity.

Statement 2 is correct.  Zombie startups often survive because they manage to secure continued funding, either through further investment rounds or by delaying debt repayments. This external support allows them to continue operations even though they are not commercially sustainable in the long term.  This often happens due to investor reluctance to accept losses or write-offs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. A "funding winter" refers to a period of reduced venture capital investment. While it does increase the risk of startup failure, not all startups close during such a period.  Some startups with strong fundamentals or existing revenue streams may continue to operate, while others may be forced to restructure or close down.  The impact varies depending on each startup's individual financial health and investor support.


**7. With reference to the Coal Controller Organisation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. It is responsible for regulating the production and distribution of coal across India, ensuring equitable access for consumers.
2.  It serves as an appellate authority in case of disputes between coal producers and consumers concerning the declared grade of coal.
3.  The Coal Controller Organisation's data on coal statistics is not publicly accessible, due to commercial sensitivities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

2.  A primary goal of stablecoins is to serve as a bridge between cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat currencies, reducing volatility.
3.  All stablecoins maintain a 1:1 peg to the US dollar; deviations are unacceptable and lead to immediate regulatory action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Stablecoins are designed to maintain a *consistent* value.  While some may be pegged to a basket of assets, the goal is to minimize volatility, not to be subject to it. The design aims to reduce the price fluctuations inherent in other cryptocurrencies.

Statement 2 is correct. A key function of stablecoins is to provide a stable asset within the volatile cryptocurrency market.  This allows for easier transactions and reduces the risk associated with rapid price swings.  This bridge between crypto and fiat currencies is a core aspect of their utility.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While many stablecoins aim for a 1:1 peg to the US dollar, this is not universally true.  Some stablecoins are pegged to other assets (like commodities or other cryptocurrencies), and even those pegged to the USD can experience temporary deviations from the 1:1 ratio.  Regulatory action varies greatly depending on the jurisdiction and nature of the deviation.

The Capital Account records transactions related to the flow of capital, such as foreign direct investment and portfolio investment.  These are distinct accounts within the BoP framework.

Statement 2 is correct. A current account deficit indicates that a nation's spending on imports and other current transactions (like income payments abroad) surpasses its earnings from exports and other current receipts (like remittances). This imbalance reflects a net outflow of funds from the country.

Statement 3 is correct. The Balance of Payments always balances due to its double-entry bookkeeping nature.  Any deficit in one account (like the Current Account) must be offset by a surplus in another account (like the Capital Account or the Financial Account) to ensure the overall balance sheet is in equilibrium.  This reflects the fundamental accounting principle of balance in international transactions.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s functions, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI exclusively manages the Consolidated Fund of India.
2. The RBI prints currency notes for the Government of India, but the Government of India mints coins.
3.  The RBI's monetary policy implementation directly influences the exchange rate of the Indian Rupee.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a crucial role in the Indian financial system and manages the government's accounts, the Consolidated Fund of India is managed by the Government of India itself.  The RBI manages the government's cash balances and conducts transactions on its behalf, but it doesn't exclusively manage the entire Consolidated Fund.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI is responsible for the issuance of currency notes in India, while the Government of India is responsible for minting coins. This division of responsibility is a key aspect of the Indian monetary system.

Statement 3 is correct. The RBI's monetary policy decisions, such as changes in repo rates or reserve requirements, directly impact the money supply and interest rates, which in turn significantly influence the exchange rate of the Indian Rupee in the foreign exchange market.  The interaction between monetary policy and exchange rates is a core element of international finance.


**2. With reference to Cooperative Banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the primary regulator for cooperative banks' lending norms.
2.  Cooperative banks are owned and operated exclusively by the Government of India.
3. Cooperative banks significantly contribute to priority sector lending in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI, is the primary regulatory authority for cooperative banks in India, overseeing their lending practices and overall operations. SEBI regulates the securities market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cooperative banks are member-owned institutions; their ownership rests with their members, who are also their customers.  While the government may have some regulatory oversight, it does not own or operate these banks.

Statement 3 is correct. Cooperative banks play a vital role in extending credit to the priority sector, particularly in rural areas, aligning with the government's policy objectives for financial inclusion and rural development.  Their contribution to priority sector lending is a significant aspect of their function.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) measures the overall economic growth of India.
2. The RBI solely determines the limits for Ways and Means Advances (WMA) provided to the Government of India.
3. The RBI is a member of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's FI-Index is a specific metric designed to track progress in financial inclusion, not a measure of overall economic growth.  Economic growth is measured by broader indicators like GDP growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI provides WMA to the Government of India, the limits are mutually decided and revised periodically by both the Government of India and the RBI.  It's a collaborative decision, not solely determined by the RBI.

Statement 3 is correct. The RBI is a member of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a global forum for central banks that fosters international monetary and financial cooperation.  Membership in the BIS is a crucial aspect of the RBI's international engagement.


**4. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Council is a body established under Article 279 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Union Finance Minister is the Chairperson of the GST Council, holding a two-thirds voting power.
3. The GST Council makes recommendations on tax rates and thresholds for GST.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is established under Article 279A of the Constitution, not Article 279.  This is a crucial detail related to the constitutional basis of the GST system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Union Finance Minister chairs the GST Council, the voting power is distributed differently: the Centre has one-third of the total voting power, and the States collectively have two-thirds.  Understanding the voting structure is essential to comprehending the Council's decision-making process.

Statement 3 is correct.  The GST Council's key responsibilities include making recommendations on various aspects of GST, including tax rates, thresholds, and other crucial parameters.  This is a fundamental function of the Council.


**5. With reference to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), consider the following statements:**

1. The SAT was established under the IRDAI Act, 1999.
2. The SAT's jurisdiction is limited to the state of Maharashtra, where its bench is located.
3. The Presiding Officer of the SAT is appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SAT was established under the SEBI Act, 1992, not the IRDAI Act, 1999.  This highlights the difference in the legal frameworks governing securities markets and insurance regulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SAT's jurisdiction extends to the whole of India, not just Maharashtra.  Its single bench in Mumbai does not limit its reach across the country.

Statement 3 is correct.  The appointment process for the Presiding Officer of the SAT involves consultation between the Central Government and the Chief Justice of India, ensuring judicial independence.  This highlights the importance of judicial appointment procedures.


**6. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2. NaBFID's primary objective is to address gaps in short-term, recourse-based infrastructure financing.
3. NaBFID's shareholding is exclusively held by private sector investors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  This reflects the RBI's role in overseeing financial institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID focuses on addressing gaps in *long-term*, *non-recourse* infrastructure financing.  The distinction between short-term/long-term and recourse/non-recourse financing is crucial.

Statement 3 is incorrect. NaBFID's entire shareholding is currently held by the Government of India. While the NaBFID Act allows for participation from other entities, currently, the government holds all shares.


These questions demand precise factual recall and understanding of the nuances related to each organization and its functions.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's in-depth knowledge and ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI's primary role is regulating the stock exchange market in India.
2. The RBI Act of 1934 established the RBI, initially as a privately owned entity.
3. The RBI's current surplus transfer to the government is significantly influenced by the recommendations of the Malegam Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a crucial role in India's financial system, its primary function is not regulating the stock exchange.  SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is the primary regulator for securities markets in India.  The RBI's focus is on monetary policy, currency management, and banking regulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the RBI Act of 1934 laid the foundation for the RBI, it was not initially privately owned. It was established as a central bank with a significant shareholding by the British government, transitioning to nationalization in 1949.

Statement 3 is correct. The Malegam Committee (2013) and later the Bimal Jalan Committee (2014-15) significantly influenced the RBI's approach to surplus transfer to the government.  Their recommendations led to a revised economic capital framework, resulting in a higher percentage of surplus being transferred. The significant increase in the surplus transfer in 2022-23 (188% jump from 2021-22) reflects this influence.



**2. With reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The LCR measures a bank's ability to meet long-term liquidity needs during a crisis.
2.  The RBI's proposed changes to the LCR aim to increase the ratio to a range of 113%-116%.
3. The LCR is a measure designed to prevent financial crises from spreading and causing wider economic harm.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LCR specifically focuses on *short-term* liquidity needs, not long-term.  It assesses a bank's capacity to withstand a short-term stress scenario, typically lasting 30 days.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The proposed changes aim to *reduce* the LCR, not increase it.  The target range is 113%-116%, lower than the 130% recorded in Q4 FY24. This reduction reflects a shift in the RBI's approach to liquidity management, potentially due to a stabilizing liquidity situation.

Statement 3 is correct.  The LCR is a key component of Basel III regulations, designed to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. By requiring banks to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), it aims to prevent crises from spreading and minimizing economic damage.



**3. With reference to Cooperative Banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) regulates the banking aspects of cooperative banks, such as capital adequacy and lending norms.
2. Cooperative banks operate on the principle of "one person, one vote," ensuring equal participation in decision-making.
3. The RBI's regulation of cooperative banks is primarily based on the Cooperative Societies Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RCS focuses on management-related aspects of cooperative banks, not banking aspects.  The RBI, under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Banking Laws (Application to Co-operative Societies) Act, 1965, is responsible for regulating the banking aspects, including capital adequacy, risk control, and lending norms.

Statement 2 is correct.  The "one person, one vote" principle is a core tenet of cooperative banks, reflecting their democratic and member-centric nature. This contrasts with traditional banks where voting rights are often proportional to shareholding.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI's regulation of cooperative banks is primarily based on the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Banking Laws (Application to Co-operative Societies) Act, 1965, not the Cooperative Societies Act.  The Cooperative Societies Act governs the cooperative aspects of their structure and management, while the RBI oversees their banking operations.


**4. With reference to the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSS Act, 2007), consider the following statements:**

1. The PSS Act prohibits foreign entities from operating payment systems in India.
2.  The Act came into force on August 12, 2007.
3. The RBI is designated as the primary authority for regulating and supervising payment systems under the PSS Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PSS Act does *not* prohibit foreign entities from operating payment systems in India. It allows foreign entities to operate, provided they receive authorization from the RBI.  This reflects India's increasingly globalized financial landscape and the need for international participation in payment systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act came into force on August 12, 2008, not 2007.  This is a crucial detail, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC examinations.

Statement 3 is correct. The PSS Act explicitly designates the RBI as the primary regulatory authority for payment systems in India. This reflects the RBI's central role in maintaining financial stability and regulating the country's payment infrastructure.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS):**

1. The RB-IOS was launched in 2022 as part of the RBI's Alternate Grievance Redress (AGR) Framework.
2. The scheme covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), regardless of their asset size.
3. The RB-IOS aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints involving deficiency in services rendered by entities regulated by the RBI.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS was launched in 2021, not 2022.  Precise timelines are important details in UPSC questions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RB-IOS covers NBFCs with an asset size of ₹100 crore and above, not all NBFCs.  This highlights the importance of understanding the specific criteria and limitations of government schemes.

Statement 3 is correct.  The core objective of the RB-IOS is to provide a cost-effective and accessible mechanism for resolving customer grievances related to deficiencies in services provided by RBI-regulated entities.  The "One Nation One Ombudsman" approach further emphasizes its accessibility.


**6.  With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID was established in 2022 by an Act of Parliament.
2. NaBFID's primary objective is to address gaps in short-term, recourse-based finance for infrastructure development.
3.  NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID was established in 2021, not 2022.  Again, accurate timelines are essential for UPSC answers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID focuses on *long-term*, *non-recourse* finance for infrastructure, not short-term recourse-based finance.  This distinction highlights the specific niche NaBFID occupies in the infrastructure financing landscape.

Statement 3 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India), not SEBI. SEBI regulates securities markets, while the RBI oversees financial institutions like NaBFID.


**7. With reference to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PFRDA was established in 2013 through an Act of Parliament.
2. The PFRDA operates under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Rural Development.
3. The PFRDA regulates both the National Pension System (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PFRDA was established in 2003 through a government resolution, with the PFRDA Act passed later in 2013.  The initial establishment and subsequent legislative framework are distinct events.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PFRDA operates under the Ministry of Finance, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This reflects the financial nature of its regulatory responsibilities.

Statement 3 is correct.  The PFRDA is the primary regulatory body for both the NPS and the Atal Pension Yojana, encompassing a significant portion of India's pension landscape.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the  Unified Payments Interface (UPI):**

1. UPI was developed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2016.
2. The transaction limit for UPI is capped at ₹5 lakh for all categories.
3. UPI Lite X enables users to send and receive money offline using Near Field Communication (NFC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  UPI was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not the RBI, in 2016. The RBI plays a regulatory role but not the developmental role.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UPI transaction limit is not uniformly capped at ₹5 lakh. While the limit has been increased to ₹5 lakh for hospitals and educational institutions, the general limit remains lower.

Statement 3 is correct. UPI Lite X is a key feature that facilitates offline transactions using NFC technology. This is a significant development for financial inclusion, especially in areas with limited internet connectivity.


**9. With reference to Card Networks in India, consider the following statements:**

1. RuPay dominates the credit card market in India.
2. The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee charged to businesses for processing card transactions.
3. American Express is not an authorized card network in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RuPay dominates the *debit* card market, not the credit card market. Visa and Mastercard hold a larger share of the credit card market.

Statement 2 is correct. The MDR is a crucial element of the card transaction process, representing the fee charged to merchants for facilitating card payments.

Statement 3 is incorrect. American Express is an authorized card network operating in India, although it holds a smaller market share compared to RuPay, Visa, and Mastercard.


**10. With reference to the  Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (ICRR), consider the following statements:**

1. ICRR is a tool used by the RBI to inject surplus liquidity into the banking system.
2. Banks earn interest on the funds maintained under ICRR.
3. ICRR can be imposed in addition to the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ICRR is used to *absorb* surplus liquidity, not inject it.  It's a tool to control excess liquidity in the system, often employed during periods of high inflation or rapid economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Banks do *not* earn interest on funds maintained under ICRR.  This is a key difference compared to the CRR, where banks may earn some interest.

Statement 3 is correct. The RBI has the discretion to impose ICRR in addition to the CRR, providing an additional tool for liquidity management.  This flexibility allows the RBI to tailor its monetary policy response to specific economic conditions.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC's Chairperson and members are appointed by the President of India for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 62, whichever is earlier.
2.  The UPSC advises the President on matters relating to the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.
3.  Articles 315 to 323 of the Indian Constitution exclusively govern the UPSC's functioning, leaving no room for parliamentary legislation on related matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President appoints the Chairperson and members of the UPSC, their term is six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier, not 62.  The Constitution provides for this in Articles 316 and 317.

Statement 2 is correct. The UPSC plays a crucial role in advising the President on appointments to various high constitutional offices, including the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.  This is a significant aspect of the UPSC's mandate to ensure merit-based appointments in key government positions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Articles 315 to 323 deal extensively with the UPSC's composition, powers, and functions,  Parliament retains the power to legislate on matters related to the UPSC, provided such legislation does not violate the basic structure of the Constitution.  The Constitution grants the Parliament this power through the provision of Article 368.


**2. Consider the following statements concerning Money Bills in India:**

1. A Money Bill can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, but only on the recommendation of the President.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Money Bills can *only* be introduced in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. This is a fundamental aspect of India's parliamentary system, designed to ensure the Lok Sabha's primary control over financial matters. The President's recommendation is, however, necessary before the introduction of a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha's power regarding Money Bills is severely restricted. It can only hold a Money Bill for a maximum of 14 days; it cannot amend or reject it.  This reflects the Lok Sabha's dominance in financial legislation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Speaker's decision on whether a Bill is a Money Bill is given significant weight, it is not entirely unchallengeable.  The Supreme Court can review the Speaker's decision if it's deemed to be a violation of the Constitution.


**3. With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha's term is six years, unless dissolved earlier by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  One-third of the Rajya Sabha members retire every two years, not three. This ensures a continuous presence of experienced members while allowing for regular renewal.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vice-President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, and he presides over its sessions.  This is a key constitutional provision.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Only the Lok Sabha can initiate Money Bills.  The Rajya Sabha can only review and recommend amendments but cannot reject or amend a money bill.

1. The President appoints the Governors of States for a term of five years, subject to the President's pleasure.
2. The President can withhold assent to any bill passed by Parliament, except for Money Bills.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President appoints the Governors of States for a term of five years, but they hold office during the pleasure of the President.  This means the President can remove a Governor at any time.

Statement 2 is correct. The President has the power to withhold assent to any bill passed by Parliament, except for Money Bills, where the President's role is largely ceremonial.  This is a significant aspect of the President's legislative powers.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The President appoints the Chief Justice of India and other Supreme Court judges, but only on the advice of the Prime Minister in consultation with the Chief Justice of India.  This is a key aspect of the collegium system of judicial appointments.

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Governor is appointed by the President for a term of five years, not six, and can be removed at the President's pleasure, not through impeachment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Governors can suspend, remit, or commute sentences, they cannot pardon death sentences. Only the President of India has that power.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Governor is the ex-officio Chancellor of all universities located within the state.  This is a largely ceremonial role but holds significant importance in the academic governance of the state.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Lok Adalats can also settle pre-litigation disputes, avoiding the need for formal court proceedings. This is a key advantage of the Lok Adalat system.

Statement 2 is correct. The decisions of Lok Adalats are final and binding on the parties, and no appeal lies against them in any court. This ensures speedy and effective dispute resolution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Lok Adalats are primarily established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, not the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  While both relate to alternative dispute resolution, their legal basis and operational frameworks differ significantly.


**8. Consider the following statements with reference to the Law Commission of India:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Law Commission of India is not a constitutional body; it is a non-statutory body constituted by the government from time to time.

Statement 2 is correct. The Law Commission functions under the Ministry of Law and Justice and submits its reports to the government, which then decides on the action to be taken.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Law Commission reviews and recommends changes to existing laws and may suggest new legislation. However, the drafting of bills and their introduction in Parliament is the responsibility of the government.  The Law Commission's role is advisory and recommendatory.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, employing plausible distractors and requiring accurate factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Information Act, 2005, was enacted in India before the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2. The Department of Personnel and Training is the sole body responsible for the implementation of the Right to Information Act, 2005.
3. The President of India's immunities are explicitly defined within the Right to Information Act, 2005.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Right to Information Act, 2005, was enacted *after* the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.  The 2005 Act superseded and improved upon the earlier act.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Department of Personnel and Training plays a significant role, the implementation of the Right to Information Act, 2005, involves multiple agencies including Central and State Information Commissions who oversee its implementation at different levels. The President's immunities are not defined in the RTI Act; they are instead enshrined in the Indian Constitution (Article 361).  Therefore, statement 3 is also false.  The RTI Act deals with citizens' right to access government information, not the President's legal protections.


**2. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's appointment of Governors requires prior consultation with the Chief Justice of India.
2. The President's power to grant pardons is explicitly limited to offences against Union laws only.
3.  Jagdamba Devi was appointed as President of India based on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President consults various individuals and bodies for appointments, the consultation with the Chief Justice of India is not mandatory for appointing Governors.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's pardon power (Article 72) extends to all punishments or sentences, including those for offences against State laws.  Statement 3 is incorrect; Jagdamba Devi was not the President of India.  The question uses a distractor name to confuse the candidate. The President's power and appointment processes are governed by the Indian Constitution, and the question tests knowledge of these complex procedures.


**3. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) has the power to impose a fine of up to ₹25,000 for non-compliance with its orders.
2.  The tenure of Information Commissioners is five years.
3. The President appoints the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners based solely on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CIC can impose penalties for non-compliance, the maximum fine amount is different from ₹25,000. The exact amount is dependent on the severity of the non-compliance.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The tenure of Information Commissioners under the RTI Act is three years, not five. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The appointment of CICs and ICs is done by the President, but it is based on the recommendation of a committee chaired by the Prime Minister, not solely on the Prime Minister's recommendation.  The process involves a selection committee with multiple stakeholders.


**4. With reference to Money Bills in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill and send it back to the Lok Sabha for reconsideration.
2. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha's decision on whether a bill is a Money Bill is final and binding on all courts.
3.  A Money Bill can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha by any Member of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill; it can only offer recommendations within 14 days.  Statement 2 is correct. The Speaker's decision on whether a bill is a Money Bill is final and binding.  There is no judicial review of this decision. Statement 3 is incorrect. A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, by a minister, and only on the recommendation of the President.  The Rajya Sabha has no power to initiate a Money Bill.


**5. With reference to the President of India's powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can return a Money Bill to the Parliament for reconsideration.
2. The President enjoys absolute veto power over all types of bills.
3. The President appoints the judges of the Supreme Court based on the recommendations of the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President cannot return a Money Bill for reconsideration; they can only give assent or withhold assent. Statement 2 is incorrect. The President does not possess absolute veto power over all bills;  their powers are nuanced and vary depending on the type of bill (Money Bill vs. ordinary bill).  Statement 3 is correct, although the process involves consultations and a collegium system.  The President's power to appoint Supreme Court judges is a significant aspect of their role, but the exact procedure is more complex than simply accepting the CJI's recommendation.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1. The UPSC is a statutory body established under Article 315-323 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Chairman and members of the UPSC hold office for a term of five years or until they attain the age of 62, whichever is earlier.
3. The UPSC conducts the civil services examination to select officers for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and other Central Services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UPSC is a *constitutional* body, not a statutory body, established under Articles 315-323 of the Constitution.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The tenure of UPSC members is six years, or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier. Statement 3 is correct. The UPSC is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination and selecting candidates for various All-India Services and Central Services.  The question tests knowledge of the UPSC's constitutional status and the precise details of the tenure of its members.


**7.  With reference to the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FTs were established under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.
2.  An FT possesses the powers of a civil court, including the power to summon witnesses and examine them under oath.
3. The decisions of FTs are subject to appeal directly to the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTs were established much earlier, under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964,  The Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, does not create FTs but instead impacts the application process for citizenship based on religion. Statement 2 is correct. FTs are quasi-judicial bodies with significant powers, including the ability to summon witnesses and compel the production of documents. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Appeals against FT decisions typically go to High Courts, not directly to the Supreme Court.  The question highlights the difference between the establishment of FTs and the impact of the CAA on their function.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Gram Nyayalayas in India:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established by the State Governments in consultation with the respective High Courts and the Central Government.
2. The Gram Nyayalayas Act extends to the entire territory of India, including all States and Union Territories.
3.  The primary objective of Gram Nyayalayas is to provide speedy and inexpensive justice to people in urban areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While State Governments establish Gram Nyayalayas in consultation with the High Courts, the Central Government's direct involvement in the establishment process is less significant.  The emphasis is on state-level implementation. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gram Nyayalayas Act does *not* extend to all states; it excludes Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and some tribal areas. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas aim to provide inexpensive justice in *rural* areas, not urban areas. The question tests the examinee's understanding of the geographical reach and the primary goal of Gram Nyayalayas.


**9. With reference to the Scheduled Castes list in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 341 of the Constitution empowers the President to specify which castes, races, or tribes are to be considered Scheduled Castes.
2. The Parliament can make changes to the Scheduled Castes list through a simple majority.
3. Once the Scheduled Castes list is published by the President, the State Governments can make additions or deletions to the list.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 341 grants the President the power to notify the Scheduled Castes list. Statement 2 is incorrect. Changes to the Scheduled Castes list require parliamentary legislation, not a simple majority.  It requires a constitutional amendment process.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  State Governments cannot modify the Scheduled Castes list once it is published by the President; any changes must be made by Parliament through a constitutional amendment. The question tests knowledge of the constitutional process for defining Scheduled Castes and the limitations on state power in this area.


**10. With reference to the Governor's powers regarding bills, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor can withhold assent to a bill indefinitely.
2. If the Governor returns a bill for reconsideration, the State Legislature is obligated to reconsider it within a specified timeframe.
3.  The Governor's power to reserve a bill for the President's consideration is absolute and cannot be challenged.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, although the Governor's power to withhold assent is subject to certain constitutional conventions and political realities.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  There is no prescribed timeframe for the State Legislature to reconsider a bill returned by the Governor; it's only expected to be done "as soon as possible".  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Governor's power to reserve a bill is not absolute; their decision is subject to judicial review in appropriate circumstances.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the Governor's powers concerning bills and their limitations.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the process of Money Bill passage in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha after the President's recommendation.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can reject a Money Bill but cannot amend it.
3.  The President can return a Money Bill to the Parliament for reconsideration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Money Bill *must* originate in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. While the President's recommendation is required for its introduction, the Lok Sabha is the initiating chamber.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to considering the bill for a maximum of 14 days.  They cannot reject it outright.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha has limited powers over a Money Bill.  It can only recommend amendments, but the Lok Sabha has the final say and can accept or reject these recommendations. The Rajya Sabha cannot completely reject a Money Bill.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The President's powers regarding Money Bills are limited to giving assent or withholding assent.  The Constitution explicitly prevents the President from returning a Money Bill to the Parliament for reconsideration. This is a crucial aspect of the Money Bill's special legislative process designed to ensure the government's financial authority.  The President's role is primarily a formality after the Parliament has passed the bill.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Tribunal System in India:**

1.  The 42nd Constitutional Amendment of 1976 introduced the term "tribunal" into the Constitution, specifically through Articles 323A and 323B, exclusively for taxation and land reforms matters.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2010 ruling restricted the scope of Article 323B, limiting the creation of tribunals only to the subjects mentioned in the Seventh Schedule.
3.  The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 42nd Amendment did introduce Articles 323A and 323B, establishing the framework for tribunals, it did not exclusively limit their scope to taxation and land reforms. Article 323B allows for the creation of tribunals on other matters as well, as clarified by later Supreme Court rulings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2010 Supreme Court ruling actually *expanded* the scope of Article 323B, clarifying that legislatures have the power to create tribunals on any subject within their purview (as listed in the Seventh Schedule),  not restricting it as the statement suggests.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NGT is a *statutory* body created by an Act of Parliament, not a constitutional body established directly under the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the framework for the creation of tribunals, but the specific tribunals are established through legislation.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor is appointed by the President for a term of six years, and is removable only through impeachment by Parliament.
2.  Under Article 163, the Governor exercises his functions entirely at his discretion, without needing to consult the Council of Ministers.
3.  Article 161 grants the Governor the power to grant pardons, commutations, and remissions of sentences in certain cases, similar to the President's power under Article 72.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Governors are appointed by the President, but their term is not fixed at six years; it's at the pleasure of the President.  They are not removable through impeachment; the President can dismiss them.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor has some discretionary powers,  Article 163 mandates that the Council of Ministers aids and advises the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in cases where the Constitution requires him to act in his discretion.  This is a crucial difference from the President's position.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 161 grants the Governor the power to pardon, commute, or remit sentences in certain cases.  This power is analogous to the President's power under Article 72, although there might be some differences in the scope and application of these powers.  Both hold executive clemency power, a fundamental part of their respective roles.


**4. With reference to Lok Adalats in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lok Adalats are established under the Legal Services Authorities Act of 1987 and operate under the same jurisdiction as the High Courts.
2.  Lok Adalats can handle both civil and criminal matters, including non-compoundable offenses.
3.  The decisions of Lok Adalats are final and binding, with no provision for appeal to any court of law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Adalats are established under the Legal Services Authorities Act of 1987, but their jurisdiction is not the same as that of High Courts. They have the jurisdiction of the court under which they are established (i.e., District Court, etc.), but it's not the same as the High Court's jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lok Adalats can handle both civil and criminal matters, but they *cannot* handle non-compoundable offences. This is a key limitation to ensure the due process of law is not compromised.

Statement 3 is correct, but with a crucial caveat. The decisions of Lok Adalats are deemed final and binding, and there is no formal appeal process. However, dissatisfied parties are free to initiate fresh litigation in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  This seemingly contradictory feature reflects the ADR nature of Lok Adalats, aiming for amicable settlements, yet acknowledging the right to seek judicial redress if needed.


**5. With reference to the Law Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Law Commission of India is a statutory body established under Article 370 of the Constitution.
2. The Law Commission primarily undertakes proactive law reforms based on its own assessment of legal needs.
3. The Law Commission's recommendations are binding on the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Law Commission of India is a *non-statutory* body constituted by the Government of India from time to time. It is not established under any specific article of the Constitution. Article 370 deals with the temporary provisions regarding Jammu and Kashmir.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Law Commission's role is primarily *reactive*, recommending reforms in existing laws based on requests from the government or other stakeholders, rather than proactively identifying and proposing reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Law Commission's recommendations are advisory in nature and not binding on the Parliament.  The Parliament has the discretion to accept or reject the recommendations, taking into account various other factors.  The Commission plays a crucial but non-binding role in legal reform.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements about the Ganges River:**

1.  The Ganges River's primary source is the Bhagirathi River, which originates from the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas.
2.  The Ganges River Dolphin, a critically endangered species, is found exclusively in the lower reaches of the Ganges River.
3.  The Sone River, a major tributary of the Ganges, merges with the Ganges near Patna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the Bhagirathi River is a major source and forms part of the Ganges,  the Ganges River system is actually a confluence of several rivers originating from different Himalayan glaciers, including the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda, which meet at Devprayag to form the Ganges.  Gangotri glacier is the source of the Bhagirathi, but not the sole source of the Ganges.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ganges River Dolphin is found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems. Its range extends beyond the lower reaches of the Ganges.  The statement oversimplifies the dolphin's habitat.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Sone River merges with the Ganges near Patna, but the statement is inaccurate in its claim of being a *major* tributary. While significant, other tributaries like the Gandak and Kosi are considered larger in terms of volume and impact on the Ganges' flow.


**2. With reference to the Arabian Sea, consider the following statements:**

1. The Narmada River, a major west-flowing river of peninsular India, drains into the Arabian Sea.
2. The Arabian Sea receives significantly less rainfall compared to the Bay of Bengal due to its location and the influence of monsoon winds.
3. The Lakshadweep Islands, a Union Territory of India, are situated in the northernmost part of the Arabian Sea.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Narmada River is a significant west-flowing river in peninsular India, and it indeed drains into the Arabian Sea. This is a well-established geographical fact.

Statement 2 is correct. The Arabian Sea receives comparatively less rainfall than the Bay of Bengal. This difference is primarily due to the orographic effect of the Western Ghats and the Bay of Bengal's more direct exposure to the monsoon winds.  The Bay of Bengal receives heavier rainfall because of the convergence of monsoon winds over the landmass of India.  The Arabian Sea, while receiving monsoon rainfall, does so to a lesser extent.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Lakshadweep Islands are located in the *eastern* Arabian Sea, not the northernmost part.  The statement misrepresents their geographical position within the Arabian Sea.


**3. With reference to the impact of El Niño and La Niña on the Indian monsoon, consider the following statements:**

1.  El Niño events are characterized by warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, leading to weaker monsoons in India.
2.  La Niña events are characterized by cooler-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, generally resulting in above-average rainfall in India.
3.  The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phenomenon can either amplify or moderate the effects of El Niño and La Niña on the Indian monsoon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. El Niño events are associated with warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. This warming disrupts atmospheric circulation patterns, often resulting in weaker and less predictable monsoons in India.

Statement 2 is mostly correct, although not universally true. While La Niña generally leads to an enhanced Indian monsoon, the degree of enhancement varies considerably.  The statement simplifies a complex relationship and would be considered more precise if it stated that La Nina *generally* results in above-average rainfall.

Statement 3 is correct. The IOD is a climate pattern in the Indian Ocean that can significantly influence the Indian monsoon rainfall. The IOD's interaction with El Niño and La Niña can either amplify or lessen their effects on the monsoon, making rainfall predictions more complex.  The interaction is not always predictable and the effect of one on the other is not always consistent.



**4. With reference to the  'Lithium Triangle', consider the following statements:**

1. The Lithium Triangle comprises Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, countries with significant lithium reserves in the Andes Mountains.
2. Brazil, a major producer of several other minerals, possesses significant lithium reserves within the Amazon basin, competing with the Lithium Triangle.
3.  The extraction and processing of lithium from these regions involve complex geological and environmental considerations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lithium Triangle is a well-known geographical region encompassing Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. These three South American nations share a significant portion of the world's lithium reserves, primarily located in the salt flats of the Andes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Brazil is a major mineral producer, its lithium reserves are not significant enough to compete directly with the Lithium Triangle. The statement incorrectly attributes substantial lithium reserves to Brazil within the Amazon basin.  Brazil's lithium reserves, while present, are not on the scale of those within the "Lithium Triangle."

Statement 3 is correct. Lithium extraction and processing are complex processes.  The geological conditions in which lithium is found (salt flats, brines) and the environmental concerns surrounding water usage and the disposal of waste materials during extraction and processing present significant challenges.


**5. With reference to Notified Disasters in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Financial assistance for notified disasters is exclusively provided under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
2.  Heatwaves have recently been officially classified as a notified disaster by the Indian government, enabling access to relief funds.
3.  The criteria for classifying a disaster as 'notified' involve a comprehensive assessment of the scale of damage and the consequent need for national-level intervention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Disaster Management Act, 2005, provides a framework for disaster management and relief, financial assistance for notified disasters may also come from other sources and schemes.  The statement is oversimplistic in its assertion of exclusive funding.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian government has recently included heatwaves in the list of notified disasters, making them eligible for financial assistance from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).

Statement 3 is correct. The decision to classify a disaster as 'notified' is made after a detailed evaluation of its impact, considering factors like the extent of damage to life and property, the affected population, and the need for substantial resources for relief and rehabilitation.  This assessment involves various government agencies and bodies.


**6. With reference to the  Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCZ is a vast area in the central Pacific Ocean known for its rich biodiversity, particularly deep-sea ecosystems.
2.  The primary economic interest in the CCZ centers around the extraction of polymetallic nodules, which contain valuable metals.
3.  Environmental concerns regarding deep-sea mining in the CCZ, including potential impacts on biodiversity and the ocean floor, are significant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CCZ is a large area in the Pacific Ocean with a unique and relatively unexplored deep-sea ecosystem, although biodiversity is not necessarily rich or abundant given the deep sea environment.  The statement is not inaccurate in its description.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CCZ is primarily known for its vast deposits of polymetallic nodules, which are rich in metals like manganese, cobalt, nickel, and copper. These nodules are of significant economic interest to several countries and companies.

Statement 3 is correct. Deep-sea mining in the CCZ raises significant environmental concerns.  Potential impacts on fragile deep-sea ecosystems, habitat destruction, and the release of sediment plumes are major issues that require careful consideration and mitigation strategies.


**7.  With reference to the countries sharing borders with Liberia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Guinea and Sierra Leone are the only two countries that share land borders with Liberia.
2.  Mauritania shares a maritime border with Liberia across the Atlantic Ocean.
3.  Burkina Faso is geographically close to Liberia but does not share a direct border.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Guinea and Sierra Leone do share land borders with Liberia,  Ivory Coast also shares a border with Liberia.  The statement omits an important bordering country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mauritania is located far north of Liberia and does not share any border, land or maritime, with Liberia.  The statement is geographically inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct. Burkina Faso is relatively distant from Liberia and does not share a land border.  The statement correctly identifies the geographical relationship.


**8. With reference to the countries sharing borders with Rwanda, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rwanda shares borders with Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania.
2.  Ethiopia is geographically close to Rwanda but does not share a direct border.
3.  Zambia is separated from Rwanda by several other countries, making it not a neighboring country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Rwanda shares land borders with Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania. These are its immediate neighboring countries.

Statement 2 is correct. Ethiopia is located relatively far from Rwanda, separated by several other countries.  While geographically in the same region, it's not a direct neighbor.

Statement 3 is correct.  Zambia is not a neighboring country of Rwanda.  A considerable distance and several other countries separate them.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Seine River:**

1. The Seine River is the longest river that flows entirely within France, surpassing the Loire River in length.
2. The Seine River and its banks in Paris are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
3. The Seine River empties into the English Channel after flowing through the city of Paris.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Loire River is actually longer than the Seine River and flows entirely within France. The Seine is a significant river, but not the longest entirely within France.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While parts of the Seine in Paris are historically and culturally significant, the entire Seine River and its banks are *not* a single designated UNESCO World Heritage site.  The statement is inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The Seine River does indeed flow through Paris and empties into the English Channel. This is a factual geographical statement.


**10. With reference to the Bhakra Dam, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakra Dam is constructed across the Sutlej River in the Indian state of Punjab.
2. The Bhakra Dam is the highest concrete gravity dam in India.
3. The Bhakra Nangal Project, associated with the Bhakra Dam, primarily focuses on irrigation and power generation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bhakra Dam is on the Sutlej River, it is primarily located in Himachal Pradesh, not Punjab, though it does irrigate parts of Punjab. The statement inaccurately identifies the state.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bhakra Dam is a high gravity dam, but it is not the *highest* in India. That title belongs to another dam. The statement wrongly claims the highest height.

Statement 3 is correct. The Bhakra Nangal Project, which includes the Bhakra Dam, is a multipurpose project focused on irrigation and hydropower generation.  The statement accurately describes the project's primary aims.


**11. With reference to the Indus River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus River originates from the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas.
2. The Indus River flows through the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan in India.
3.  The Indus River ultimately drains into the Arabian Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus River originates from the glaciers of the Kailash range in Tibet, not the Gangotri glacier. The statement misidentifies the source.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Indus River's basin touches these states, the main flow of the Indus River is primarily in Pakistan and parts of China and Afghanistan.  The statement is inaccurate about the river's main course.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indus River does indeed drain into the Arabian Sea. This is a well-established geographical fact.


**12. With reference to the Brahmaputra River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Brahmaputra River originates from the Manasarovar Lake in Tibet.
2. The Brahmaputra River is known as the Yarlung Tsangpo River in its upper course in Tibet.
3. The Subansiri River, a major tributary, joins the Brahmaputra in Assam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Chandipura virus (CHPV):**

1. CHPV primarily affects children below the age of 15 and is characterized by a febrile illness that can sometimes be fatal.  Spread is primarily through sandflies, while transmission through ticks is less common.
2.  First identified in 1965 in Chandipura, Maharashtra, CHPV is a member of the *Paramyxoviridae* family and its spread is effectively controlled through the widespread use of a highly effective vaccine.
3.  Early diagnosis and supportive treatment are crucial for managing CHPV infections, as there is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available.  The virus resides in the salivary glands of infected vectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  CHPV predominantly affects children under 15, presenting with a febrile illness that can be fatal in some cases. While sandflies are a primary vector, the text also mentions ticks as vectors, making the statement's assertion about the relative rarity of tick transmission a nuanced point. The emphasis on sandflies as the *primary* vector makes the statement acceptable within the context of a MCQ.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that CHPV belongs to the *Rhabdoviridae* family, not *Paramyxoviridae*.  Furthermore, it explicitly states that *no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is currently available*. The claim of a highly effective vaccine is completely fabricated.

Statement 3 is correct. The text emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and supportive care due to the lack of specific treatments or vaccines. The statement correctly notes the virus's location within the salivary glands of the vectors.


**2. With reference to the treatment of snakebites, consider the following statements:**

2.  Approximately 1.4 million people die annually from snakebites globally, with Africa and Asia being the most affected regions.  Research suggests that tinzaparin's effectiveness against snake venom is limited to neurotoxic venoms.
3.  The use of tinzaparin in treating snakebites has been widely adopted and is now the standard of care in most affected regions. Human clinical trials have concluded, demonstrating its widespread efficacy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The news excerpt highlights the discovery of tinzaparin's potential to reduce cell damage caused by spitting cobra venom, contrasting this with the outdated nature of current snakebite treatments.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The provided number of deaths (1.4 lakh, or 140,000) is consistent with the information given. The text does not specify the types of venom tinzaparin is effective against, making the addition about neurotoxic venoms a plausible distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The news report only mentions that researchers have filed for a patent and *may start human clinical trials soon*.  The claim that tinzaparin is the standard of care and has completed successful clinical trials is false.


**3. With reference to Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), consider the following statements:**

1. PAM is a common and easily treatable central nervous system infection caused by amoebae found in saltwater environments. Symptoms typically manifest within 1-2 days of exposure.
2.  PAM is caused by *Naegleria fowleri*, an amoeba that enters the body through the nasal passages, destroying brain tissue and causing severe brain swelling.  The disease is more prevalent during warmer months.
3. PAM is a rare but lethal infection with a high fatality rate. The amoeba *Naegleria fowleri* is found in freshwater sources such as lakes and rivers, but never in seawater.  Patients typically exhibit symptoms 1 to 9 days after exposure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts. PAM is described as *rare*, not common, and has a *high fatality rate*.  The amoeba is found in *freshwater*, not saltwater, and the incubation period is given as 1 to 9 days, not 1-2 days.

Statement 2 is correct. It accurately describes the cause of PAM (*Naegleria fowleri*), the route of infection (nasal passages), and the resulting symptoms (brain tissue destruction, swelling). The increased prevalence during warmer months is also correctly stated.

Statement 3 is correct. It accurately describes PAM as rare but lethal, specifies the habitat of *Naegleria fowleri* (freshwater, not seawater), and provides the correct incubation period (1-9 days).


**4.  With respect to Tuberculosis (TB), consider the following statements:**

1. Tuberculosis (TB) is a non-infectious disease primarily affecting the kidneys, caused by the bacteria *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Transmission occurs through direct contact.
2. TB manifests in two forms: latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease.  In LTBI, the bacteria are present but controlled by the immune system, showing no symptoms. Active TB disease is characterized by symptoms such as a persistent cough, chest pain, weight loss, and fever.
3. The symptoms of active TB disease can vary depending on the location of the infection within the body. While the lungs are most commonly affected, TB can also affect the kidneys, brain, spine, and skin.  The BCG vaccine provides complete protection against all forms of TB.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. TB is explicitly stated as an *infectious* disease, and while it *most often* affects the lungs, it can affect other organs like the kidneys, brain, spine, and skin.  Transmission is primarily *airborne* (through coughing and sneezing), not through direct contact.

Statement 2 is correct. It accurately describes the two forms of TB (LTBI and active TB disease) and their characteristics.

Statement 3 is correct. It correctly highlights the variability of symptoms based on the location of the infection.  However, the statement that the BCG vaccine provides *complete protection* is an overstatement; BCG offers partial protection against some forms of TB, but not complete immunity against all forms.


**5. With reference to Mpox (monkeypox), consider the following statements:**

1. Mpox is a non-infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It is primarily transmitted through contact with infected animals, with human-to-human transmission being rare.
2. The monkeypox virus was first discovered in Denmark in 1958 in monkeys used for research; the first human case was reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.  Mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, and a characteristic rash.
3.  Mpox spreads from person-to-person through close contact with an infected individual.  Most people recover fully, but some experience severe illness.  There is a highly effective vaccine available to completely prevent the disease.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

2.  Conservation efforts for the Great Indian Bustard have been significantly hampered by the expansion of solar energy projects in its crucial habitats.
3. The IUCN Red List classifies the Great Indian Bustard as Vulnerable, reflecting its declining population and habitat loss.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Great Indian Bustard has a presence in several Indian states, its core population resides in the grasslands of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra.  The mention of "smaller populations in other states" is a deliberate but accurate distractor, as it acknowledges the bird's wider, albeit less concentrated, distribution.

Statement 2 accurately reflects a major challenge in Great Indian Bustard conservation. The rapid expansion of solar energy projects, often without adequate environmental impact assessments, has led to significant habitat loss and fragmentation, directly impacting the bird's survival. This is a crucial UPSC-relevant point, highlighting the conflict between development and conservation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IUCN Red List currently classifies the Great Indian Bustard as Critically Endangered (CR), not Vulnerable (VU). This is a key difference that tests factual recall and understanding of conservation status classifications.  The use of "Vulnerable" as a distractor is designed to exploit potential confusion between different threat categories.  The slight change in the word "reflecting" to a word that is somewhat different in meaning is another distractor.


**2. With reference to the conservation status and legal protection of the Great Indian Bustard, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has issued directives concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard's habitat.
2.  The Great Indian Bustard is listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, affording it the highest level of protection.
3. The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) lists the Great Indian Bustard under Appendix I, indicating its critically endangered status and requiring international cooperation for its conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Statement 3 is incorrect. Predation by large carnivores is not a primary factor in the decline of the Great Indian Bustard. The primary threats are habitat loss and human-induced mortality, not predation. This statement introduces a plausible but incorrect distractor, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between major and minor threats.  The use of "primary cause" is another distractor.



These MCQs are designed to be challenging, requiring not only the recall of facts but also the ability to analyze and evaluate information critically, mirroring the demands of the UPSC exam.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing deeper understanding rather than simple memorization.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions on Kashmir, based on the provided target content.  The questions are designed to be challenging, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall and analytical skills.  The difficulty level is assessed as 'difficult'.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajatarangini, a historical chronicle of Kashmir, details the region's conversion to Buddhism in the 7th century CE.
2.  The Karkota dynasty's rule in Kashmir significantly advanced the region's metal sculpture tradition, utilizing zinc and copper alloys.
3.  The flourishing of Saiva sects in Kashmir during the medieval period influenced the development of its distinctive wooden houseboat architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajatarangini, authored by Kalhana, primarily details Kashmir's history from pre-historic times to the 12th century CE, focusing on the reign of various kings and dynasties. While Buddhism had a presence in Kashmir, the Rajatarangini emphasizes the dominance of Hinduism and later, Islam.  The text does not specifically mention a widespread conversion to Buddhism in the 7th century CE.

Statement 2 is correct. The Karkota period (7th-9th centuries CE) in Kashmir witnessed a significant development in metal sculpture.  The artisans of this era were skilled in working with various metals, including zinc and copper alloys, producing intricate and sophisticated sculptures.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Saiva sects were indeed influential in Kashmir's religious and cultural landscape, particularly during the medieval period. However, their influence is primarily associated with religious practices and philosophy, rather than the architectural style of houseboats. The distinctive houseboat architecture of Kashmir evolved later, influenced by practical needs and environmental factors.  Wooden houses are a distinct feature, but their connection to Saiva sects is not historically established.


**2. With reference to the history of Kashmir, consider the following statements:**

1.  The archaeological site of Burzahom, known for its Neolithic engravings, predates the introduction of Sanskrit to the Kashmir region.
2.  The Mongol conquest of Kashmir in the 14th century CE resulted in a significant decline in the region's Sanskrit manuscript repositories.
3.  The conversion of Kashmir to Islam, beginning in the 14th century CE, led to the immediate cessation of agriculture practiced since 6000 BCE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Archaeological evidence from Burzahom indicates a Neolithic presence significantly earlier than the established period of Sanskrit's influence in Kashmir. Neolithic settlements and their associated artifacts predate the arrival and widespread adoption of Sanskrit.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Mongol invasions did disrupt Kashmir, but the claim of a *significant decline* in Sanskrit manuscript repositories requires further evidence. While some damage may have occurred,  it's an overstatement to claim a significant overall decline. The impact on the repositories might have been localized or less severe than implied.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the conversion to Islam was a significant historical event, it did not lead to the immediate cessation of agriculture. Agricultural practices continued in Kashmir after the conversion, albeit with potential shifts in crops and techniques. The continuous practice of agriculture from 6000 BCE is well documented, and the Islamic conversion did not abruptly halt this long-standing tradition.


**3. With reference to the cultural landscape of Kashmir, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kashmir Stag (Hangul), an endemic species, was significantly impacted by the partition of India in 1947.
2.  The Kashmiri lattice work, a renowned art form, shows influences from both the Himalayas and Central Asia.
3.  The Pandrethan Temple, an example of Himalayan architecture, flourished during the Karkota period in Kashmir.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the partition of India in 1947 did impact Kashmir politically,  its direct impact on the Hangul population is not the primary factor contributing to its endangered status. Habitat loss and other ecological factors are more significant.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kashmiri lattice work, a unique and intricate art form, demonstrates a blend of influences.  The Himalayan region's natural forms and materials are evident, and Central Asian artistic traditions may also have contributed to its evolution.

Statement 3 is correct. The Pandrethan Temple is indeed a significant example of Himalayan architecture, and its construction and flourishing coincided with the Karkota period (7th-9th centuries CE), a time of relative stability and prosperity in Kashmir.  The architectural style reflects the region's geographical location and the prevailing artistic sensibilities of the time.


**4.  Consider the following statements about the ecological features of Kashmir:**

1.  The Kashmir Valley, located within the Himalayan Ranges, experiences a monsoon season that is shorter and less intense than the monsoon in other parts of India.
2.  The presence of willows and other riparian vegetation along the rivers of Kashmir contributes to the region's biodiversity.
3.  The phenomenon of Chilla-i-Kalan, a period of intense cold, primarily affects the lower altitudes of the Kashmir Valley.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kashmir Valley, while situated in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, does experience a monsoon season. Although it may be somewhat shorter and less intense compared to regions receiving direct monsoon rainfall, it is not significantly shorter or less intense across the valley as a whole.

Statement 2 is correct. The diverse flora of Kashmir, including willows and other riparian species, contributes significantly to the region's biodiversity. The river systems and their associated vegetation support a wide range of plant and animal life.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Chilla-i-Kalan, a period of intense cold in Kashmir, primarily affects the higher altitudes.  The lower altitudes experience cold, but the most severe effects of this climatic phenomenon are felt at higher elevations.

**1. Consider the following statements about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

1. The SDGs, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015, aim to eradicate poverty by 2025 through a globally coordinated effort involving governments, NGOs, and the private sector.
2.  The implementation of the SDGs is solely the responsibility of national governments, with minimal involvement from international organizations like the UNDP or the World Bank.
3.  The Green Credit Scheme in India directly contributes to achieving SDG 13 (Climate Action) by incentivizing carbon sequestration projects but does not have any connection with other SDG goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while the SDGs aim to eradicate poverty, the target year is 2030, not 2025. The implementation also involves a multitude of actors beyond just governments, NGOs, and the private sector.  Statement 2 is incorrect because international organizations play a significant role in supporting and monitoring SDG implementation through technical assistance, funding, and capacity building. The UNDP, for example, is a key player in this regard. Statement 3 is incorrect as the Green Credit Scheme, while contributing to environmental sustainability, has broader implications and connections to several SDGs beyond just SDG 13.  The SDGs are interconnected and addressing one goal often contributes to progress in others.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**2. With reference to the  implementation of the SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The District Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) in India is primarily responsible for the formulation of the SDGs at the national level, leaving the implementation details to individual states.
2. REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) programs, though primarily focused on climate change mitigation, indirectly contribute to several SDGs, including SDG 15 (Life on Land).
3. The target year for achieving the SDGs is 2040, reflecting the ambitious and long-term nature of these goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While DMEOs monitor implementation at the district level, the formulation of SDGs is a process involving national and international bodies, not solely DMEOs.  Statement 2 is correct. REDD+ programs, while focused on climate change, also support biodiversity conservation (SDG 15), sustainable livelihoods (SDG 1), and poverty reduction (SDG 1). Statement 3 is incorrect; the target year for achieving the SDGs is 2030, not 2040.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to the  characteristics of the SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1. The SDGs are legally binding international treaties, ensuring universal compliance and accountability across all nations.
2. The SDGs primarily focus on economic development, giving secondary importance to social and environmental considerations.
3. The UNGA set the SDGs, but their implementation is entirely decentralized, with no global coordination or monitoring mechanisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is false.  The SDGs are not legally binding; they are a set of aspirational goals.  Statement 2 is false.  The SDGs explicitly aim for a balance between social, economic, and environmental sustainability, recognizing their interconnectedness.  Statement 3 is false. While implementation is primarily national, there are global coordination and monitoring mechanisms in place, including regular UN reports and international collaborations.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the  impact of the SDGs:**

1. The SDGs are expected to completely eliminate poverty and hunger by 2030, achieving zero prevalence globally.
2. The achievement of the SDGs will automatically lead to gender equality and zero discrimination against women and girls worldwide, requiring minimal additional efforts.
3. The SDGs are designed to be universally applicable, addressing the unique challenges faced by both developed and developing countries, with appropriate adaptations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GEAC did approve Bt cotton in 2002, and the description of its genetic modification is accurate. The initial limited release is also a factual detail. Statement 2 is also correct. Bollgard II does offer improved resistance compared to Bollgard I, and the impact on pesticide use and the emergence of pest resistance are accurate observations.  Monsanto and Mahyco's involvement is well-documented. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While Bt cotton is currently the main GM crop commercially grown, it's not the *only* one approved.  Other GM crops are under development or face moratoriums, indicating that the statement presents an oversimplification of the situation.


**2. With reference to the ‘white category’ industries in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) introduced the ‘white category’ classification in 2016, based on a pollution index (PI) score.  Industries with a PI score between 21 and 40 are categorized as ‘orange.’  Prior environmental clearances from state pollution control boards are not required for white category industries under the Air Act, 1981, and the Water Act, 1974.
2.  The CPCB's reclassification of industries in 2016 involved evaluating factors like emissions, effluent discharge, and hazardous waste generation.  The pollution index (PI) score ranges from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating lower pollution potential.  Wind and solar power projects fall under the ‘green’ category, while activities like bicycle assembly are classified as ‘white.’
3.  The ‘white category’ designation exempts certain industries from the requirement of prior permission from state pollution control boards for establishment and operation.  The CPCB's classification system aims to streamline the regulatory process while addressing pollution concerns.  The permissible noise levels for white category industries are determined by the respective state pollution control boards.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

Statement 1 is incorrect because it wrongly states that industries with a PI score between 21 and 40 are 'orange'. The text doesn't specify the exact score range for each category. Statement 2 is incorrect as it misplaces wind and solar projects into the 'green' category when the text clearly states they are 'white'. Statement 3 is correct. The ‘white category’ does provide the exemption mentioned, and the aims of the CPCB's classification are accurate.  The final clause about noise levels is a distractor, as the text focuses on air and water pollution regulations.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sendai Framework, adopted in 2015, aims to substantially reduce disaster-related losses in lives, livelihoods, and health by 2030. The framework emphasizes the importance of community-based disaster risk reduction measures and the integration of disaster risk reduction into development planning.  The framework is primarily implemented by individual UN member states.
2. The primary goal of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is to significantly reduce the number of people affected by disasters.  It encourages countries to develop and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies and to enhance international cooperation on disaster risk reduction. The framework establishes specific targets for reducing disaster losses by 2030, based on the Hyogo Framework for Action.
3.  The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is a non-binding agreement adopted by UN member states. It outlines seven global targets for reducing disaster risk and building resilience. The framework promotes a holistic approach to disaster risk management, encompassing prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.  The UN plays a coordinating role in promoting the implementation of the framework.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Sendai Framework does aim to reduce disaster losses by 2030, and its emphasis on community involvement and integration into development planning are accurate.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while the framework aims to reduce the impact of disasters, its primary goal is reducing *losses* (lives, livelihoods, health), not just the number of people affected.  Statement 3 is correct. The Sendai Framework is indeed non-binding, and the description of its components and the UN's role are accurate.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are completely correct.  Statement 2 contains a partially correct fact but misrepresents the primary goal.


These questions demonstrate the desired level of difficulty and incorporate various cognitive skills, while avoiding direct copying from the source material.  They also highlight potential misconceptions and distractors, making them suitable for a challenging UPSC-style examination.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level by incorporating misleading information and plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Western Ghats:**

1. The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri range, are a UNESCO World Heritage site, primarily located in the states of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, with portions extending into Goa, Maharashtra, and Telangana.  Their formation occurred during the early Paleozoic era.
2.  The Western Ghats act as a significant water divide, influencing the monsoon winds and causing orographic rainfall, resulting in high precipitation in the coastal regions and a rain-shadow effect on the eastern slopes, impacting states like Andhra Pradesh.  Significant magnetite reserves are found within the range.
3. The Western Ghats are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including several globally threatened species, and support various biomes, including subtropical moist pine forests and tropical rainforests. The  Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) has extensively studied the region's biodiversity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Western Ghats are indeed a UNESCO World Heritage site and are predominantly located in Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, extending into Goa and Maharashtra. However, the statement incorrectly places their formation in the early Paleozoic era; the correct geological period is the Late Cenozoic.  The inclusion of Telangana is also slightly misleading, as its connection is primarily through the rain-shadow effect.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Western Ghats do act as a significant water divide, influencing monsoon winds and creating orographic rainfall.  The rain-shadow effect does impact states like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.  The statement correctly mentions magnetite reserves. However, the description of the rainfall pattern is oversimplified; the impact is more complex and varies regionally.

Statement 3 is correct. The Western Ghats are renowned for their rich biodiversity, harboring numerous globally threatened species and supporting diverse biomes, including those mentioned. The WGEEP has played a crucial role in studying the region's ecology.


**2. With reference to the geographical features of peninsular India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Palghat Gap, a significant geological feature, forms a natural passage through the Western Ghats, connecting the eastern and western coastal plains. The Eastern Ghats are significantly higher in elevation than the Western Ghats.
2. The Western Ghats' steep gradient and high rainfall contribute to rapid water flow, leading to the formation of numerous rivers, including the Periyar, Sharavathi, Pamba, and Mahadayi rivers, all originating within the range. The Cauvery River originates outside the Western Ghats.
3. The rain-shadow effect caused by the Western Ghats results in relatively lower rainfall in the regions to their east, particularly affecting the coastal plains of Tamil Nadu and creating drier conditions compared to the western slopes. Sugarcane cultivation thrives in the rain-shadow regions of the Western Ghats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Palghat Gap is a significant feature facilitating passage through the Western Ghats, the statement incorrectly claims the Eastern Ghats are higher; the Western Ghats are considerably higher.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Western Ghats' steep gradient and high rainfall do indeed contribute to rapid water flow, resulting in the formation of numerous rivers. However, the statement incorrectly attributes all listed rivers to originating within the Western Ghats; the Cauvery River's origin is in the Brahmagiri hills, which are part of the Western Ghats, but this is not explicitly stated.


Statement 3 is partially correct. The Western Ghats do cause a rain-shadow effect, leading to lower rainfall in eastern regions, particularly impacting the Tamil Nadu coast. However, the statement incorrectly suggests that sugarcane cultivation thrives in these rain-shadow regions; sugarcane prefers more consistent and abundant water sources.


**3. With reference to the Western Ghats and associated committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gadgil Committee and the Kasturirangan Committee both submitted reports focusing on the ecological sensitivity of the Western Ghats, recommending the establishment of ecologically sensitive zones (ESZs) and restrictions on various activities within these zones. The High-Level Working Group (HLWG) report completely rejected the Kasturirangan committee report.
2.  The Western Ghats are a biodiversity hotspot, sharing this status with Sri Lanka.  The Western Ghats Experts Ecology Panel (WGEEP) was tasked with studying and providing recommendations for the conservation of the Western Ghats. These recommendations were fully implemented by the government.
3. The Western Ghats support various biomes, including tropical rainforests and sub-tropical moist pine forests.  The Gadgil Committee report, while recommending ESZ establishment, did not consider the economic aspects related to the region's development, specifically ignoring the potential for solar energy development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While both committees focused on the Western Ghats' ecology and recommended ESZs, the HLWG report did not completely reject the Kasturirangan report; it offered a modified approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Western Ghats are a biodiversity hotspot shared with Sri Lanka, and the WGEEP did provide recommendations,  the statement inaccurately claims that these recommendations were fully implemented.  The implementation has been partial and controversial.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Gadgil Committee report did, in fact, address economic aspects, though the extent of its consideration of solar energy potential is debatable and requires further clarification.  The statement presents an oversimplification of the committee's scope.


**4. Consider the following statements about the UNESCO's role:**

1. UNESCO, headquartered in Paris, France, is a specialized agency of the United Nations, established in 1945. It manages the World Heritage Sites program, including sites in India, and also works on the recognition and preservation of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The UPSC syllabus includes questions related to UNESCO's activities.
2. UNESCO's involvement extends to various fields, including education, science, culture, and communication.  Its designation of sites as World Heritage Sites is based on specific criteria, including cultural significance and natural beauty.  The Western Ghats were designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2012.
3. UNESCO's work includes the management of programs like the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme and the Global Geoparks Network (GGN). It also plays a role in the adoption and implementation of International Treaties related to cultural and natural heritage.  India is a founding member of UNESCO.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) All three
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. UNESCO's establishment date, headquarters, and its role in managing World Heritage Sites (including those in India) and Intangible Cultural Heritage are accurately described in Statement 1. The UPSC syllabus often includes questions on UNESCO.

Statement 2 correctly highlights UNESCO's diverse fields of activity and its criteria for World Heritage Site designation. The Western Ghats' designation in 2012 is also accurate.

Statement 3 accurately describes UNESCO's management of programs like the MAB Programme and GGN and its role in international treaties.  India's status as a founding member is also correct.


These questions demonstrate the desired difficulty level and incorporate the necessary elements for a UPSC-style examination.  They require factual recall, analysis, and evaluation to answer correctly, avoiding simple guessing.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC conducts examinations in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Delhi, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Pune, and Ranchi.
2.  The UPSC syllabus includes Indian Art and Culture and Indian Polity as core subjects.
3.  The UPSC exclusively handles recruitment for all-India and central services, excluding state-level services and Group C & D services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided data explicitly lists Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Delhi, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Pune, and Ranchi as exam locations for the UPSC.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The target content indicates that "Indian Art and Culture" and "Indian Polity" are included in the UPSC syllabus.  These are significant subjects within the General Studies component of the Civil Services Examination.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the UPSC conducts examinations for all-India and central services, it does *not* exclusively handle these recruitments.  The UPSC also assists states in joint recruitment processes and advises on promotion and disciplinary matters within government services.  Further, the text clearly states that UPSC does *not* handle selection for Commissions/Tribunals, diplomatic posts, and Group C & D services. Therefore, the statement's assertion of exclusivity is false.


**2. With reference to the UPSC, consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC's independence is safeguarded by the Constitution of India, requiring presidential approval for appointments and other key decisions.
2. The UPSC primarily relies on upscstudyhub.com and t.me/hubupscstudy as its official online resources for exam preparation materials.
3. The UPSC's role includes advising the Union government on matters related to the civil services, including appointments, promotions, and disciplinary actions but excludes policy decisions on reservations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is a constitutional body, and its independence is derived from the Constitution.  The data shows that appointments, including the chairman and members, require the President of India's approval. This underscores the UPSC's constitutional protection and its role in maintaining the meritocratic system in the civil services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While upscstudyhub.com and t.me/hubupscstudy are mentioned as resources *for* UPSC aspirants, they are not officially endorsed or maintained by the UPSC itself. The UPSC provides its own official resources, including the syllabus and previous year's question papers, through its official website and publications.

Statement 3 is correct. The UPSC advises the Union government on various aspects of civil services, including appointments, promotions, and disciplinary actions.  However, the information explicitly states that the UPSC is *not* consulted on policies related to reservations for backward classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.  This demonstrates the limits of the UPSC's advisory role and its focus on merit-based selection within the existing policy framework.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI solely manages the issuance of all banknotes in India, including the one-rupee note.
2.  The RBI's monetary policy tools include the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and open market operations (OMO), but excludes the management of  ways and means advances.
3. The RBI regulates commercial banks, NBFCs, and cooperative banks but does not have any regulatory oversight over Payment Banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI issues all banknotes except the one-rupee note, which is issued by the Ministry of Finance. This highlights the division of responsibilities in currency management between the RBI and the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI uses repo rate, reverse repo rate, and OMOs as monetary policy tools.  However, the data also shows that the RBI manages ways and means advances, providing short-term credit to the central and state governments.  This demonstrates the RBI's broader role in managing government finances and liquidity in the economy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI regulates commercial banks, NBFCs, and cooperative banks.  The data also shows that the RBI licenses and regulates Payment Banks. This indicates the RBI's extensive regulatory reach in the Indian financial system, encompassing various types of banking institutions.  The statement is therefore factually inaccurate.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS):**

1.  RDSS aims to reduce Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% by 2024-25, but excludes private sector DISCOMs from its coverage.
2. RDSS subsumes schemes like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), and the Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP)-2015.
3. RDSS prioritizes smart metering in 500 AMRUT cities with AT&C losses exceeding 15%, all Union Territories, and MSMEs, industrial, and commercial consumers but not government offices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RDSS aims to improve the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of DISCOMs.  The scheme targets a reduction in AT&C losses to 12-15% by 2024-25. However, it specifically excludes private sector DISCOMs. This focus on public sector DISCOMs reflects the government's policy priorities in ensuring reliable and affordable power supply.

Statement 2 is correct. The RDSS integrates and replaces earlier schemes like IPDS, DDUGJY, and PMDP-2015, creating a unified approach to distribution sector reform. This consolidation demonstrates the government's effort to streamline and improve the effectiveness of its power sector initiatives.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While RDSS prioritizes smart metering in 500 AMRUT cities with high AT&C losses, all Union Territories, and MSMEs, industrial, and commercial consumers, it *also* includes all government offices at the block level and above. This broad coverage underscores the scheme's goal of achieving universal coverage and improving power supply across all sectors.


**5. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a multilateral initiative enabling instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic Fast Payments Systems (FPS), including India's UPI, with systems in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand but excluding ASEAN countries.
2. Project Nexus is primarily driven by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and aims to enhance India's financial technology infrastructure.
3. Project Nexus is expected to improve cross-border transaction efficiency and promote financial inclusion across participating countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Project Nexus does aim to interlink domestic FPS, including India's UPI, with systems in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.  However, the exclusion of ASEAN countries is inaccurate, as Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand are all members of ASEAN.  This shows a misunderstanding of the geographical scope of the project.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI is a crucial participant in Project Nexus,  it is not solely driving the initiative. Project Nexus is a multilateral initiative, meaning it involves multiple countries and international organizations. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is the main initiator.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the project's governance structure.

Statement 3 is correct. A key objective of Project Nexus is to enhance cross-border payment efficiency and promote financial inclusion.  By connecting different national payment systems, the project aims to reduce transaction costs and improve access to financial services for individuals and businesses across participating countries.  This aligns with broader global efforts toward greater financial integration and inclusivity.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', utilizing various techniques to create challenging distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                      |  Attribute
1. Ahilyabai Holkar           |  Reconstructed the Kashi Vishwanath Temple
2. Malhar Rao Holkar          |  Established the Holkar dynasty
3. Tukoji Rao Holkar          |  Ruled Malwa in the 18th century
4. Maheshwar                 |  Capital of the Maratha Empire


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. Ahilyabai Holkar, a significant 18th-century Maratha ruler, is known for her extensive temple renovations, including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi.  Option (b) is incorrect because while Maheshwar was Ahilyabai's capital, it wasn't the capital of the entire Maratha Empire.  The Maratha Empire had a shifting capital system, with various cities holding prominence at different times. Option (c) is incorrect as Tukoji Rao Holkar succeeded Ahilyabai; he wasn't her contemporary ruler of Malwa. Option (d) is incorrect because Malhar Rao Holkar, Ahilyabai's father-in-law, was instrumental in establishing the Holkar dynasty's power but not its formal founding.  The establishment of a dynasty is a gradual process involving multiple generations and events.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Location                    |  Associated Figure
1. Somnath Temple             |  Khand Rao
2. Malwa                       |  Ahilyabai Holkar
3. Maheshwar                  |  Tukoji Rao Holkar
4. Kashi Vishwanath Temple   |  Malhar Rao Holkar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign and influence were significantly associated with the Malwa region.  The other options are incorrect.  While Ahilyabai Holkar renovated the Somnath Temple, it wasn't directly associated with her husband, Khand Rao (Option 1).  Maheshwar was Ahilyabai’s capital, but Tukoji Rao Holkar, her successor, later became prominent (Option 3).  Similarly, Malhar Rao Holkar, Ahilyabai's father-in-law, played a crucial role in the Holkar dynasty, but the Kashi Vishwanath Temple's association is primarily with Ahilyabai herself (Option 4).


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Individual                   |  Patronage
1. Moropant                    |  Ahilyabai Holkar
2. Khushali Ram                |  Shivaji Maharaj
3. Shahir Anantaphandi         |  Maheshwar textile industry
4.  Raja Bhalendra Singh       |  37th National Games


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  Moropant was a poet patronized by Ahilyabai Holkar.  Raja Bhalendra Singh's association with the 37th National Games is through the trophy named after him.  The other pairings are incorrect.  Khushali Ram's patronage isn't definitively linked to Shivaji Maharaj (Option 2), and Shahir Anantaphandi's connection to the Maheshwar textile industry is not directly established in the available data (Option 3).


**4. With reference to Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following pairs:**

    Term                         |  Description
1. Punyashlok                   |  Title meaning "ruler who frees the people from all kinds of deprivations"
2.  Maheshwar                   |  A major textile center known for Maheshwari saris.
3.  Khand Rao                    |  Son of Ahilyabai Holkar
4.  18th Century                 |  The period when the Maratha empire was at its zenith.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  "Punyashlok" is indeed a title associated with Ahilyabai Holkar signifying her benevolent rule. Maheshwar, her capital, is renowned for its textile industry and Maheshwari saris.  Ahilyabai Holkar lived and ruled during the 18th century, a period often associated with the Maratha Empire's expansion, although it wasn't necessarily at its absolute zenith throughout the entire century. Option (c) is incorrect because Khand Rao was Ahilyabai's husband, not her son.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Historical Figure           |  Significant Action
1.  Ahilyabai Holkar           |  Established her capital at Indore
2.  Shivaji Maharaj            |  Abolished the Zamindari system
3.  Birsa Munda                |  Known as 'Dharti Abba'
4.  Shyama Prasad Mukherjee   |  Founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Birsa Munda was indeed referred to as 'Dharti Abba' by his followers. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.  The other options are incorrect. Ahilyabai Holkar established her capital at Maheshwar, not Indore (Option 1). Shivaji Maharaj reformed the revenue system but didn't abolish the Zamindari system; that happened later during British rule (Option 2).


These questions demand precise factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related but ultimately incorrect information, making them challenging and suitable for a high-stakes exam like the UPSC.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the facts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Historical Figure          Associated Location
    1. Ahilyabai Holkar          Maheshwar
    2. Birsa Munda              Ulihatu
    3. Ram Prasad Bismil       United Provinces
    4. Shivaji                     Agra

Which of the pairs given above are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ahilyabai Holkar established her capital in Maheshwar, Madhya Pradesh.  Birsa Munda was born in Ulihatu, Khunti district, Jharkhand. Ram Prasad Bismil was born in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh).  While Shivaji visited Agra, it wasn't a location intrinsically associated with his rule or origin. His primary area of influence was the Maratha Empire, encompassing significant parts of present-day Maharashtra and beyond. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include Agra as a location fundamentally associated with Shivaji.  Option (a) correctly identifies the primary locations associated with the three historical figures. This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern crucial information from potentially misleading distractors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                     Action/Achievement
    1. Ahilyabai Holkar          Renovated Somnath Temple
    2. Birsa Munda              Preached Monotheism
    3. Ram Prasad Bismil       Founded HRA
    4. Shivaji                     Reformed Ryotwari System


Which of the pairs given above are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ahilyabai Holkar is known for her extensive temple renovations, including Somnath. Birsa Munda's religious reform movement emphasized a belief in one God, contrasting with British missionary efforts. Ram Prasad Bismil co-founded the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).  Shivaji reformed the revenue system, but he did *not* implement the Ryotwari system; that was a later development. The Ryotwari system was introduced by the British.  Options (b), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing. Option (a) accurately reflects the actions and achievements of three of the individuals listed. The question assesses factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between closely related but ultimately distinct historical events.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    City                       Significance related to Ahilyabai Holkar
    1. Indore                   Prosperous trading town under her rule
    2. Maheshwar                Capital established on the Narmada River
    3. Varanasi (Kashi)          Temple renovated under her patronage
    4.  Gaya                      Temple renovated under her patronage


Which of the pairs given above are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Indore flourished as a trading center under Ahilyabai Holkar's rule.  She made Maheshwar her capital, situated on the Narmada.  Ahilyabai Holkar also oversaw the renovation of temples in Varanasi (Kashi) and Gaya. All four pairs accurately reflect her actions and impact.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect. Option (b) demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Ahilyabai Holkar's reign and its geographical context. The question tests factual recall and assesses the candidate's ability to connect a historical figure to multiple locations and their significance.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding PVTGs in India:**

    1.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.
    2.  The Asur tribe in Jharkhand is a PVTG.
    3.  The Koya tribe in Andhra Pradesh is a PVTG.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Odisha does indeed have the largest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). The Asur tribe of Jharkhand is also listed as a PVTG. However, the Koya tribe is *not* categorized as a PVTG. Options (a), (c), and (d) therefore contain inaccuracies. Option (b) accurately reflects the status of Odisha and the Asur tribe as having the highest number of PVTGs and being a PVTG respectively.  This question tests factual recall concerning PVTGs, a crucial element of Indian social studies.  The inclusion of the Koya tribe as a distractor highlights the need for precise knowledge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Musical Instrument        Region of Prominence
    1. Sarod                     North India
    2. Veena                     South India
    3. Santoor                   Jammu and Kashmir
    4.  Dholak                  Uttar Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The sarod is a prominent stringed instrument in North Indian classical music. The veena is a significant instrument in South Indian classical music. The santoor is a popular instrument from Jammu and Kashmir. The dholak, while used across India, has a strong association with Uttar Pradesh.  Options (b), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing. Option (a) correctly identifies the primary regions of prominence for three of the instruments.  This question tests factual knowledge of Indian musical instruments and their regional associations, demonstrating interdisciplinary linkage understanding.  The inclusion of plausible distractors like the dholak necessitates precise knowledge.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Festival                      State/Region
    1. Ambubachi Mela             Assam
    2. Raja Parba                 Odisha
    3. Rath Yatra                 Gujarat
    4. Pushkaralu                 Uttar Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ambubachi Mela is a significant festival in Assam. Raja Parba is celebrated in Odisha. Rath Yatra is primarily associated with Odisha, not Gujarat.  Pushkaralu is a festival of Telugu-speaking people, and while celebrated in various locations, Uttar Pradesh is not its primary location. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing. Option (a) accurately matches the states/regions with two of the festivals. This question assesses knowledge of Indian festivals and their geographical distribution, demanding accurate factual recall. The inclusion of plausible incorrect pairings requires careful consideration.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                     State/Region
    1. Asur                     Jharkhand
    2. Koya                      Odisha
    3. Bhils                     Madhya Pradesh
    4. Munda                    Jharkhand


Which of the pairs given above are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Asur tribe is found in Jharkhand. The Koya tribe is present in Odisha. Bhils have a significant presence in Madhya Pradesh.  The Munda tribe is also found in Jharkhand. All four pairs represent correct tribe-region pairings. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete. Option (c) showcases accurate knowledge of the geographical distribution of various tribal groups in India. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of tribal distribution in India. The presence of multiple correct pairings makes the question challenging.



**8. With reference to the  Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), consider the following statements:**

    1. It was founded by Ram Prasad Bismil.
    2. It later evolved into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).
    3.  Ashfaqulla Khan was a prominent member.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ram Prasad Bismil was a key founder of the HRA. The HRA later transformed into the HSRA. Ashfaqulla Khan was a significant member of the HRA, participating in the Kakori Conspiracy. All three statements accurately describe aspects of the HRA and its evolution. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete. Option (d) demonstrates a complete understanding of the HRA, its members, and its historical development. The question assesses knowledge of a specific revolutionary organization within the Indian freedom struggle.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Temple                      State/Region
    1. Kheer Bhawani Temple     Jammu and Kashmir
    2. Lingaraj Temple           Odisha
    3. Kamakhya Temple          Assam
    4. Tungnath Temple           Uttarakhand


Which of the pairs given above are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Kheer Bhawani Temple is located in Jammu and Kashmir. The Lingaraj Temple is in Odisha. The Kamakhya Temple is situated in Assam.  The Tungnath Temple is found in Uttarakhand. All four pairs correctly link the temples to their respective locations. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete. Option (d) displays a comprehensive understanding of the geographical distribution of these significant temples. This question tests factual recall and understanding of temple locations across India.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Art Form                     State/Region
    1.  Mata ni Pachedi           Gujarat
    2.  Pattachitra               Odisha
    3.  Warli Painting            Maharashtra
    4.  Kalamkari                Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Mata ni Pachedi is a traditional art form from Gujarat. Pattachitra painting is associated with Odisha. Warli painting is a tribal art form of Maharashtra. Kalamkari is a significant textile art of Andhra Pradesh.  All four pairs accurately connect the art forms to their respective states/regions. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete. Option (d) demonstrates a thorough understanding of Indian art forms and their geographical origins. The question tests factual recall and appreciation for India's diverse artistic heritage.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                           Movement/Organization
1.  Alluri Sitarama Raju             :   Non-Cooperation Movement
2.  Birsa Munda                       :   Ulgulan Movement
3.  Kazi Nazrul Islam                 :   Sramik Praja Swaraj Dal
4.  Raja Ravi Varma                  :   Calcutta Secret Society
5.  Sachchidananda Sinha             :  Bihar and Orissa Province formation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Alluri Sitarama Raju, while influenced by Gandhi's ideals, primarily led the Rampa Rebellion, a separate movement distinct from the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Birsa Munda is correctly paired with the Ulgulan Movement, his significant rebellion against colonial exploitation and discrimination against tribal communities. Kazi Nazrul Islam is correctly linked to the Sramik Praja Swaraj Dal, a socialist political party he organized.  Sachchidananda Sinha played a crucial role in the formation of the Bihar and Orissa province. Option (d) is incorrect because Raja Ravi Varma was not a member of the Calcutta Secret Society; his involvement was primarily in the artistic field.  Option (a) and (b) are also incorrect due to the mismatched pairs involving Alluri Sitarama Raju and Raja Ravi Varma respectively.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Location                         Significant Association
1.  Mogallu, Andhra Pradesh        :   Birthplace of Kazi Nazrul Islam
2.  Ulihatu, Khunti district, Jharkhand : Birthplace of Birsa Munda
3.  Churulia village, Burdwan district, West Bengal : Birthplace of Alluri Sitarama Raju
4.  Travancore Kilimanoor           :   Birthplace of Raja Ravi Varma
5.  Arrah, erstwhile Bengal Presidency: Birthplace of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The birthplace of Birsa Munda is correctly identified as Ulihatu in Khunti district, Jharkhand.  Raja Ravi Varma's birthplace is correctly given as Travancore Kilimanoor. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the birthplaces of Alluri Sitarama Raju, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Swami Sahajanand Saraswati.  Alluri Sitarama Raju was born in Mogallu near Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh, Kazi Nazrul Islam in Churulia village, Burdwan district, West Bengal and Swami Sahajanand Saraswati in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh.


**3. With reference to tribal movements in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Movement                           Key Aim/Outcome
1.  Rampa Rebellion                   :   Protection of Bakasht lands
2.  Ulgulan Movement                  :   Restriction on land transfer from tribals to non-tribals
3.  Bakasht Movement                 :   Boycott of colonial courts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ulgulan Movement, led by Birsa Munda, directly resulted in the passing of the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act in 1908, which restricted the transfer of land from tribal people to non-tribal individuals.  The other options are incorrect because the Rampa Rebellion's primary aim was against British tyranny and the exploitation of tribals, not specifically the protection of Bakasht lands. The Bakasht Movement, led by Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, focused on protecting farmers' rights to Bakasht land, not on boycotting colonial courts; that was a key feature of the Rampa Rebellion.


**4. With reference to prominent Indian personalities, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                              Notable Achievement/Association
1.  P.V. Narasimha Rao                 :   Look East Policy
2.  Chaudhary Charan Singh            :   Uttar Pradesh Consolidation of Holding Act
3.  M.S. Swaminathan                  :   Debt Redemption Bill
4.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth       :   Elphinstone College
5.  Ayya Vaikunda Swamikal            :   Suddha Sanmarga Sangam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(c) 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

P.V. Narasimha Rao is correctly associated with the initiation of the Look East Policy. Chaudhary Charan Singh's crucial role in the Uttar Pradesh Consolidation of Holding Act is well-documented. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contribution to the founding of the Native School of Bombay, which later became Elphinstone College, is historically significant. Ayya Vaikunda Swamikal founded the Suddha Sanmarga Sangam, a social and religious reform movement. Option (d) is incorrect because M.S. Swaminathan is known for his contributions to the Green Revolution, not for drafting the Debt Redemption Bill. The other incorrect options misrepresent the achievements of these figures.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Award                                   Recipient/Association
1.  Nobel Prize in Literature 2023    :   Annie Ernaux
2.  Sahitya Akademi Award               :   Rs. 1,00,000 prize money
3.  Sangeet Natak Akademi Amrit Awards :   Awarded to artists above 75 years
4.  Bharat Ratna                          :   Conferred posthumously since 1966
5.  Ramon Magsaysay Award              :   Asian version of Nobel Prize

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sahitya Akademi Award does indeed include a prize money of Rs. 1,00,000. The Sangeet Natak Akademi Amrit Awards are specifically conferred upon artists above 75 years of age who haven't received national honors previously. The Bharat Ratna has been awarded posthumously since 1966. The Ramon Magsaysay Award is widely recognized as the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Option (a) is incorrect as Annie Ernaux received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2022, not 2023. Jon Fosse won the 2023 prize. The other options incorrectly exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**6. With reference to Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State                                      Characteristic
1.  Madhya Pradesh                         :   Highest number of PVTGs
2.  Odisha                                   :   Highest absolute number of STs
3.  Chhattisgarh                            :   Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are PVTGs
4.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands           :   Presence of Shompens PVTG
5.  Tamil Nadu                             :  Kudavolai system for village administration

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Odisha has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.  Chhattisgarh correctly has the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes classified as PVTGs. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands include the Shompens as a PVTG.  The other options are incorrect because Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of STs, but not the highest number of PVTGs.  While Tamil Nadu does have the Kudavolai system, this is not a characteristic of STs specifically but a historical administrative system.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Group                          Characteristic/Association
1.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)           :   All are nomadic tribes
2.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   Subset of Scheduled Castes
3.  Nomadic Tribes (NTs)                :   All are Denotified Tribes
4.  Scheduled Tribes (STs)              :   Reservation in Panchayats
5.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                    :   Semi-nomadic group from Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Scheduled Tribes (STs) are constitutionally guaranteed reserved seats in Panchayats. The Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic group located in Karnataka.  The other options are incorrect because not all Denotified Tribes (DNTs) are nomadic tribes; many have settled. PVTGs are a subset of Scheduled Tribes (STs), not Scheduled Castes (SCs).  Not all Nomadic Tribes (NTs) are Denotified Tribes (DNTs).


**8. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                    Specific Detail
1.  Reservation in Government Jobs         :   At least 5% reservation
2.  Reservation in Higher Education         :   At least 4% reservation
3.  Free Education for Children with Disabilities :   Applies to children aged 6-18
4.  Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities:   Under Ministry of Home Affairs
5.  Definition of “Person with Benchmark Disability”:   At least 40% disability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The act mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18. The definition of a "Person with benchmark disability" correctly specifies at least 40% of a specified disability.  The other options are incorrect because the reservation in government jobs is at least 4%, not 5%, and the reservation in higher educational institutions is at least 5%, not 4%. The Office of Chief Commissioner for PwD falls under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                       Key Provision/Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Punishment for constructing insanitary latrines
2.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871              :   Repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
3.  PEMSR                                    :   Rehabilitation through alternate employment training

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, does include punishment for constructing insanitary latrines. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. The PEMSR (Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013) includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including training for alternative employment. All three pairs are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Activity                         Specific Detail
1.  Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)        :   Adopted in Singapore
2.  FATF Plenary Session                   :   India achieved an ‘Outstanding Outcome’ in 2023-24
3.  Regular Follow-up Category           :   Shared by four other G-20 countries
4.  Combating Money Laundering           :   Primary focus of FATF
5.  India's FATF Mutual Evaluation        :   Placed India in the 'regular follow-up' category

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) was adopted during a FATF Plenary Session held in Singapore.  India's evaluation placed it in the 'regular follow-up' category, a distinction shared by four other G-20 countries. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is a core mandate of the FATF. Option (d) is incorrect because, although India achieved an outstanding outcome, the statement directly links the outstanding outcome to the plenary session which is not explicitly stated. The other options incorrectly exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function                                  Associated Entity/Concept
1.  Issues currency notes                       :   Government of India
2.  Regulates commercial banks                 :   Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007
3.  Maintains foreign exchange reserves        :   Import Cover
4.  Implements Monetary Policy                 :   Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
5.  Debt manager for Central and State Govts.:   Ways and Means Advances (WMA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the central bank of India and has a multifaceted role in the Indian economy.  Let's analyze the pairs:

1. **Correct:** The RBI issues currency notes (except the one-rupee note, which is issued by the Ministry of Finance) on behalf of the Government of India. This is a core function of a central bank.

2. **Incorrect:** While the RBI regulates commercial banks, the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, primarily governs payment systems and not the overall regulation of commercial banks. The RBI's regulation of commercial banks is based on the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and other related legislation.

3. **Correct:** The RBI manages India's foreign exchange reserves, and import cover is a key metric used to assess the adequacy of these reserves.  A higher import cover indicates a stronger ability to finance imports.

4. **Correct:** The RBI implements monetary policy in India, and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) plays a crucial role in setting the policy rate and other parameters.  The MPC's decisions directly impact the RBI's actions.

5. **Correct:** The RBI acts as the debt manager for both the Central and State Governments.  Ways and Means Advances (WMA) are short-term loans provided by the RBI to the government to manage temporary mismatches in receipts and expenditures.


Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes incorrectly matched pair 2.  Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Policy/Scheme                   Implementing/Regulating Body
1.  Goods and Services Tax (GST)              :   National Insurance Academy (NIA)
2.  Minimum Support Price (MSP)                :   Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
3.  Priority Sector Lending (PSL)              :   Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)
4.  Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Policy      :   Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
5.  National Pension System (NPS)             :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of various government policies and the agencies responsible for their implementation or regulation.

1. **Incorrect:** The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is governed by the GST Council, not the National Insurance Academy (NIA).  The NIA focuses on insurance-related matters.

2. **Correct:** The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural products is decided by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).  The CCEA is a high-level government committee that takes decisions on economic matters.

3. **Incorrect:** Priority Sector Lending (PSL) is primarily regulated and monitored by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the DPIIT.  DPIIT focuses on promoting industries and internal trade.

4. **Correct:** The Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Policy for fertilizers is implemented by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. This ministry is responsible for the production and distribution of fertilizers.

5. **Incorrect:** The National Pension System (NPS) is regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), not the RBI.  The RBI's role is primarily in monetary policy and banking regulation.


Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Therefore, the correct option is (b).  The other options incorrectly include pairs that are not correctly matched.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Function/Responsibility
1.  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) :  Regulates mergers of commercial banks
2.  Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) :  Promotes exports of GI products
3.  National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) :  Regulates Payment Banks
4.  Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) :  Manages the Consolidated Fund
5.  Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) :  Operates under Ministry of Food Processing Industries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of various Indian organizations and their primary functions.

1. **Incorrect:** The IBBI regulates insolvency professionals and agencies related to bankruptcy proceedings, not bank mergers. Bank mergers fall under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

2. **Correct:** APEDA's mandate includes promoting the export of agricultural and processed food products, including those with Geographical Indications (GIs).  This is a key aspect of its role in boosting agricultural exports.

3. **Incorrect:** NaBFID is a Development Financial Institution (DFI) focused on infrastructure financing, not the regulation of Payment Banks.  Payment Banks are regulated by the RBI.

4. **Incorrect:** The Consolidated Fund is managed by the Government of India, not the PFRDA.  PFRDA regulates pension funds and related matters.

5. **Incorrect:** SIDBI operates under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), not the Ministry of Food Processing Industries.


Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The other options include incorrectly matched pairs.  Therefore, the correct answer is (b).



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Concept/Metric                      Description/Application
1.  Gross Non-Performing Asset (GNPA) Ratio :   Indicates a healthier loan portfolio
2.  Priority Sector Lending (PSL)              :   Same targets for all types of banks in India
3.  Minimum Support Price (MSP)                :   Minimum rate at which farmers sell crops to the government
4.  Angel Tax                                   :   Levied when shares are issued at a price higher than fair market value
5.  K-shaped recovery                           :   Sectors of the economy revive uniformly after a slowdown


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses understanding of various financial concepts and economic indicators.

1. **Incorrect:** A higher GNPA ratio indicates a *worse*, not healthier, loan portfolio.  A high GNPA ratio signifies a larger proportion of non-performing loans, reflecting financial instability.

2. **Incorrect:** PSL targets are *not* the same for all types of banks.  Different types of banks (scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks, etc.) have different PSL targets based on their size and reach.

3. **Correct:** The MSP is indeed the minimum rate at which the government procures crops from farmers. This policy aims to provide price support to farmers.

4. **Incorrect:** Angel tax is levied when shares are issued at a price *lower* than their fair market value, triggering scrutiny to prevent tax evasion.

5. **Incorrect:** A K-shaped recovery is characterized by *uneven* recovery, with some sectors thriving while others lag.  It doesn't imply uniform revival.


Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.  Therefore, the correct option is (b).



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                                       State/Region it flows through
1.  Jhelum                                      :   Himachal Pradesh
2.  Sutlej                                       :   Punjab
3.  Beas                                        :   Jammu and Kashmir
4.  Chenab                                      :   Gujarat
5. Ratle Power Project is located on           :   Jhelum River


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of Indian geography, specifically the location of rivers.

1. **Incorrect:** The Jhelum River flows primarily through Jammu and Kashmir, not Himachal Pradesh.

2. **Correct:** The Sutlej River flows through the state of Punjab.

3. **Incorrect:** The Beas River flows through Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, not Jammu and Kashmir.

4. **Incorrect:** The Chenab River does not flow through Gujarat. It primarily flows through Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Pakistan.

5. **Correct:** The Ratle Power Project is situated on the Chenab River, not the Jhelum River.


Only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly include mismatched pairs.  Therefore, the correct option is (c).

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                      Responsibility/Action
    1. Ministry of Finance                 :   Regulates FDI rules
    2. Department of Revenue              :   Invites suggestions on the Central Excise Bill, 2024
    3.  15th Finance Commission          :   Determines States' share of central taxes and duties
    4. GST Council                         :   Sets GST tax rates

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Finance in India holds the responsibility for formulating and notifying Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rules.  The Department of Revenue, a crucial part of the Ministry of Finance, plays a vital role in indirect taxation and customs.  Its responsibility includes soliciting feedback on draft legislation, such as the Central Excise Bill, 2024. The 15th Finance Commission, a constitutional body,  determines the share of central taxes and duties allocated to states, influencing their fiscal capacity.  The GST Council, a joint forum of the Centre and States,  is constitutionally mandated to decide on GST-related matters, which includes setting the tax rates. Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                  Trend/Characteristic
    1. India's debt-to-GDP ratio         :   Significantly decreased in recent years
    2. States' consolidated gross fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio : Remained consistently above 3% in recent years
    3. States’ Capital outlay-GDP ratio  :   Projected to increase substantially in 2023-24

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's debt-to-GDP ratio, while historically high, has shown a decline in recent years, as per certain reports.  The provided data shows a decrease from 84% to 81% between 2021-22 and 2022-23. This contradicts option (b) and (d) which state that other indicators showed consistent or only improving trends. The states' capital outlay-GDP ratio is indeed projected to increase significantly in 2023-24, reflecting increased government spending on infrastructure development. Option (a) and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude the correct pair (3) or include an incorrect pair (2).  The states' consolidated gross fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio experienced a decline from 4.1% in 2020-21 to 2.8% in 2021-22, indicating that it did not consistently remain above 3%.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                 Key Provision/Feature
    1.  Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act 2003 :   Aims to reduce general government debt to 60% of GDP
    2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution :   Regulates states' borrowing with central government consent
    3.  General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR)   :   Targets unacceptable tax avoidance practices

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The FRBM Act, 2003, aims to enhance fiscal discipline and stability, including a target for reducing general government debt to 60% of GDP.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution deals with borrowing by states, mandating central government consent under specific conditions for loans. The General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) is a provision designed to curb tax avoidance strategies that would otherwise be legally permissible under ordinary tax laws. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they incompletely represent the accurate pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                Function/Activity
    1.  Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) :   Facilitates export of agricultural and processed food products
    2.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)            :   Conducts auctions of Government Securities (G-Secs)
    3.  Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC) :   Oversees the implementation of GST

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

APEDA's primary function is to promote and facilitate the export of agricultural and processed food products from India. The RBI plays a crucial role in managing government debt and conducts auctions of G-Secs, a key instrument for government borrowing.  While the CBIC is involved in indirect taxation, including GST, it doesn't solely oversee its implementation; the GST Council shares this responsibility.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly include or exclude the correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept/Policy            Description/Characteristic
    1.  Public Debt                      :   Includes liabilities of central and state governments
    2.  Tax Buoyancy                     :   Measures responsiveness of tax revenue to changes in national income
    3.  Minimum Support Price (MSP)      :   Minimum price at which the government purchases crops from farmers
    4.  Current Account Deficit (CAD)    :   Records transactions in goods, services, and assets between residents of a country and the rest of the world

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Public debt encompasses the total borrowings of the central and state governments to finance their expenditures. Tax buoyancy measures the sensitivity of tax revenue to changes in national income. A high tax buoyancy indicates that tax revenues grow faster than the national income.  The MSP is the minimum price guaranteed by the government to farmers for their produce. Option (d) is incorrect as CAD is part of the balance of payments and does not encompass all transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world.  Options (b) and (c) are also incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Body                       Role in GST
    1.  GST Council                         :   Decides GST tax rates
    2.  GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT)      :   Hears appeals against GST orders
    3.  GST Network (GSTN)                 :   Provides IT infrastructure for GST

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GST Council is the apex body for decision-making on all aspects of the GST system, including tax rates, exemptions, and the overall structure of the tax. The GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) is the appellate body for resolving disputes arising from GST assessments and decisions. The GST Network (GSTN) provides the critical IT infrastructure and digital platform for GST taxpayers to register, file returns, and make tax payments.  All three pairs correctly describe the roles of these institutions within the GST framework. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Instrument                     Issuer/Manager
    1.  Treasury Bills (T-bills)               :   Central Government
    2.  State Development Loans (SDLs)       :   State Governments
    3.  Government Securities (G-Secs)      :   Reserve Bank of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued by the Central Government to meet its short-term borrowing needs. State Development Loans are long-term debt instruments issued by State Governments to finance their capital expenditures.  While the RBI manages the issuance and trading of G-Secs, the actual issuer is either the Central or State Governments.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude the correctly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Concept/Policy              Description/Impact
    1.  Off-Budget Borrowing (OBB)       :   Borrowing not reflected in the official budget
    2.  Angel Tax                           :   Tax levied on investments in unlisted companies at a price higher than fair market value
    3.  Priority Sector Lending (PSL)      :   Targets credit flow to vulnerable and underserved sectors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Off-Budget Borrowing refers to borrowings undertaken by government entities or public institutions outside the formal budget, often to circumvent fiscal deficit targets. Angel Tax is a specific tax imposed on investments made in unlisted companies when the share price exceeds its fair market value. Priority Sector Lending is a credit policy that directs a portion of bank lending to socially important sectors like agriculture and small-scale industries, aiming for financial inclusion.  All three pairs accurately describe the concepts. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they do not fully reflect the accurate pairings.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Program                         Implementing/Managing Agency
    1.  Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2023-24: Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance
    2.  Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS)     :   Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI)
    3.  StartupShala                          :    Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2023-24 scheme is managed by the Department of Expenditure under the Ministry of Finance. The Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) scheme is operated by SIDBI, channeling funds to startups through Alternative Investment Funds. StartupShala is a flagship accelerator program launched by DPIIT to support entrepreneurs. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the exclusion of correctly matched pairs.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Publication                     Publishing Organization
    1.  State Finances: A Study of Budget of 2023-24 :  Reserve Bank of India
    2.  International Debt Report (IDR), 2023    :  International Monetary Fund
    3.  World Economic Outlook (WEO)           :  World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) publishes an annual report on State Finances, analyzing the budgetary positions of Indian states. The World Bank publishes the International Debt Report (IDR), providing analysis on external debt statistics for low- and middle-income countries. The World Economic Outlook (WEO) is a flagship publication of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), presenting global economic forecasts and analyses. Therefore only the first two pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the correct publishers of the reports.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution          Regulatory Oversight
    1. Scheduled Commercial Banks :  Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)
    2. Regional Rural Banks       :  Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC)
    3. Small Finance Banks         :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
    4. Urban Cooperative Banks    :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulator for Scheduled Commercial Banks, Small Finance Banks, and Urban Cooperative Banks.  These banks fall under the RBI's purview for licensing, supervision, and overall regulatory compliance. The RBI's mandate includes maintaining the stability and soundness of the banking system.  Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 is also correct as the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the RBI, covers Regional Rural Banks.  However, pair 1 is incorrect.  While the PFRDA regulates pension funds, it does not have regulatory oversight of scheduled commercial banks; that responsibility rests with the RBI.  The inclusion of PFRDA as a distractor in pair 1 tests the examinee's understanding of the distinct regulatory bodies in the Indian financial system.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Policy              Implementing Agency
    1. Priority Sector Lending      :  Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)
    2. Monetary Policy             :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
    3. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
    4. Goods and Services Tax (GST) :  Ministry of Finance

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is responsible for implementing monetary policy in India. This involves managing interest rates, liquidity, and other monetary tools to achieve macroeconomic stability and price stability.  The Ministry of Finance plays a crucial role in the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a comprehensive indirect tax system in India.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the RBI, not the DPIIT, is responsible for setting guidelines on Priority Sector Lending. Pair 3 is incorrect; the RBI, not SEBI, implements the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for banks to address financial health concerns. The inclusion of DPIIT and SEBI as distractors tests the examinee's knowledge of the roles of different government agencies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Metric              Indicator of
    1. Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio :  Financial distress of a bank
    2. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)    :  Bank's lending capacity
    3.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) :  Asset quality of a bank
    4.  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) :  Bank's short-term liquidity


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A higher GNPA ratio indicates a higher proportion of loans at risk of default, signifying potential financial distress for a bank.  The LCR is a key metric reflecting a bank's ability to meet its short-term liquidity obligations. Thus, pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the CRR is a reserve requirement imposed by the RBI, directly influencing a bank's lending capacity, but not directly indicating it.  Pair 3 is incorrect; the MDR is a fee charged by a merchant acquiring bank to a merchant for processing card payments, not an indicator of asset quality.  The inclusion of CRR and MDR as distractors tests the candidate's understanding of different financial metrics and their applications in the banking sector.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Sector           Associated Issue
    1. MSMEs                     :  Regional imbalances
    2. Agriculture                :  Low rural productivity
    3.  Fisheries                 :  Overfishing
    4.  Manufacturing             :  Job creation

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

MSMEs play a crucial role in addressing regional economic imbalances by creating employment and fostering entrepreneurship in diverse geographical locations. Agriculture often faces the challenge of low productivity in rural areas, impacting income and livelihoods. The fisheries sector grapples with overfishing, threatening the sustainability of marine resources. Manufacturing contributes significantly to job creation. Therefore all pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's ability to link economic sectors with their respective challenges and contributions to the overall economy.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization      Mandate/Activity
    1. World Trade Organization (WTO) :  Mediating disputes related to the Indus Waters Treaty
    2. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) :  Publishing reports on informal employment
    3. International Monetary Fund (IMF) :  Providing financial assistance to India
    4. International Labour Organization (ILO) :  Setting minimum wages in India

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The OECD publishes reports and conducts research on various economic issues, including informal employment and its impact on economic development. The IMF provides financial assistance and policy advice to member countries, including India, to address macroeconomic imbalances and promote economic stability. Hence, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect; the World Bank, not the WTO, mediated the Indus Waters Treaty.  Pair 4 is incorrect; the ILO sets international labour standards, but minimum wages are determined nationally by each country's government, not the ILO.  The inclusion of WTO and ILO as distractors tests the candidate's understanding of the roles and functions of different international organizations.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme          Primary Objective
    1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) :  Improving the financial sustainability of DISCOMs
    2. Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) :  Promoting energy efficiency in residential buildings
    3. Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABY)  :  Sustainable groundwater management
    4.  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) :  Providing income support to farmers


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABY) focuses on sustainable groundwater management through community participation and capacity building.  The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme aims to provide income support to small and marginal farmers. Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect; PMMSY is aimed at boosting the fisheries sector, not DISCOMs. Pair 2 is incorrect; RDSS focuses on improving the electricity distribution sector, not residential building energy efficiency. The inclusion of PMMSY and RDSS as distractors tests the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes and their objectives.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation             Governing Body
    1.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Act, 1992 :  Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT)
    2.  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) Act, 1999 : National Insurance Academy (NIA)
    3.  Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 : Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS)
    4.  Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 : Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) is a statutory body established under the SEBI Act, 1992, to hear appeals against SEBI orders. The RB-IOS is a grievance redressal mechanism established by the RBI, falling under the RBI Act, 1934. The RBI is the primary regulatory body for payment and settlement systems in India under the PSS Act, 2007.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect; while the NIA conducts research and training in insurance, the IRDAI is the primary regulatory body for the insurance sector in India. The inclusion of NIA as a distractor tests the examinee's knowledge of the regulatory landscape of India's financial sector.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Technology                  Application in India
    1.  Unified Payments Interface (UPI) :  Offline payments via NFC
    2.  Near Field Communication (NFC) :  Recurring online transactions
    3.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) : Data analysis in power sector
    4. Internet of Things (IoT)     :  MSME sector


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used for data analysis in various sectors, including the power sector, for improved efficiency and predictive maintenance. The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly adopted by MSMEs to improve operational efficiency and market access. Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is partially correct; UPI enables offline payments but through UPI Lite, not UPI itself.  Pair 2 is incorrect; NFC facilitates offline transactions, but it is not the primary technology for recurring online transactions; that would involve online banking systems and e-mandates. The inclusion of UPI and NFC as distractors tests the examinee's understanding of the technological landscape of India’s financial and industrial sectors.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Organization      Function/Responsibility
    1. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) :  Administers the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS)
    2. Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) :  Provides direct finance to MSMEs
    3.  Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers :  Issues guidelines on Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)
    4.  Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) :  Administers the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The DPIIT is the monitoring agency for the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS), a scheme designed to support the Indian startup ecosystem. The Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers is responsible for issuing guidelines related to the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) policy for fertilizers. Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrect; SIDBI provides *indirect* finance to MSMEs through AIFs, not direct finance.  Pair 4 is incorrect; the BEE administers the Star Labelling Programme and is involved in CCTS, but CCTS administration is primarily under the purview of a National Steering Committee.  The inclusion of SIDBI and BEE as distractors tests the examinee's knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of different government bodies in supporting economic sectors.



**10. With reference to Statutory Bail in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Statement                                   Correctness
    1.  It applies to all offences.                  :  Incorrect
    2.  Court refusal requires written reasons.     :  Correct
    3.  It is available even for capital offences.    : Incorrect

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statutory bail is a legal provision that mandates the release of an undertrial prisoner after a certain period if the trial hasn't concluded.  It's crucial to understand that statutory bail doesn't apply to all offenses; exceptions exist, especially those involving serious crimes or those punishable by the death penalty.  The second statement is correct; if a court denies statutory bail, it must provide written reasons justifying its decision to uphold transparency and due process.  The third statement is incorrect; statutory bail is generally not available for capital offenses where the death penalty is a possible punishment. Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of statutory bail in the Indian legal system.  The distractors highlight potential misunderstandings about its scope and application.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 265 of the Indian Constitution prohibits the levying of taxes except by the authority of law.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of the net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States. Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to recommend the distribution of financial resources. Article 301 guarantees freedom of trade and commerce throughout the territory of India.  Finally, Article 368 outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution. All the pairs provided are correctly matched based on their respective constitutional provisions. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  A comprehensive understanding of the Indian Constitution's provisions regarding taxation, financial distribution, constitutional bodies, and amendment procedures is crucial for arriving at the correct answer.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article      Primary Function/Concern
1. Article 52                 Office of the Prime Minister
2. Article 74                 Council of Ministers
3. Article 86                 Presidential Address to Joint Session of Parliament
4. Article 123                Ordinance-making power of the Governor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 52 of the Constitution deals with the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  Article 74 relates to the Council of Ministers aiding and advising the President.  Article 86 outlines the President's power to address either House or both Houses of Parliament. Article 123 pertains to the President's power to promulgate ordinances, not the Governor. Article 213 correctly describes the Governor's ordinance-making power. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or omit correctly matched pairs. A thorough understanding of the roles and powers of the President, Council of Ministers, and the ordinance-making process within the Indian constitutional framework is necessary to answer this question accurately.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment    Key Provision/Impact
1. 73rd Amendment Act          Establishment of Municipal Corporations
2. 74th Amendment Act          Establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. 52nd Amendment Act          Anti-Defection Law
4. 42nd Amendment Act          Extension of Emergency Provisions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, established Panchayati Raj Institutions, not Municipal Corporations.  The 74th Amendment Act, 1992, established Municipal Corporations. The 52nd Amendment Act, 1985, introduced the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution, dealing with the anti-defection law. The 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, significantly expanded the scope of emergency provisions.  Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs (1 and 2) or omit correctly matched pairs (3 and 4).  This question tests the understanding of the significant constitutional amendments and their impact on the Indian political system, requiring detailed knowledge of the amendments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                     Subject Matter
1. The Telegraph Act, 1885    Financial Inclusion
2. The Census Act, 1948       Conducting of Census
3. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996:  Regulation of Interstate Trade and Commerce
4. Telecommunications Act, 2023:  Repeal of the Indian Wireless Telegraph Act, 1933

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Telegraph Act, 1885, primarily deals with telegraphs, not financial inclusion.  Financial inclusion is a broader socio-economic concept. The Census Act, 1948, governs the conduct of censuses in India. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, focuses on extending Panchayati Raj provisions to scheduled areas, not regulating interstate trade and commerce.  The Telecommunications Act, 2023, seeks to repeal the Indian Wireless Telegraph Act, 1933, among other acts. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they contain incorrectly matched pairs. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific legislation and their subject matters, requiring precise understanding of the acts' scope and purpose.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Institution   Constitutional Article/Schedule
1. Finance Commission              Article 265
2. Inter-State Council             Article 263
3. Committee of Privileges (Rajya Sabha)   Seventh Schedule
4.  Lok Sabha Speaker              Article 93

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission is established under Article 280, not Article 265. The Inter-State Council is established under Article 263. The Committee of Privileges (Rajya Sabha) is not directly mentioned in the Seventh Schedule, though its functions are related to parliamentary procedures outlined in the Constitution. The Lok Sabha Speaker's position is defined in Article 93.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the constitutional basis of various governmental institutions and their related articles, requiring precise recall of constitutional provisions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Emergency       Constitutional Article
1. National Emergency         Article 356
2. Financial Emergency        Article 360
3. Constitutional Emergency   Article 352

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 356 deals with the President's Rule, not a National Emergency. Article 360 correctly defines the Financial Emergency. Article 352 pertains to the National Emergency. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the different types of emergencies provided for in the Indian Constitution and the articles governing them, demanding accurate factual recall.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  A mercy petition can be filed by anyone convicted of a crime.
2.  The President can pardon sentences for offenses under only Union laws.
3.  Governors have the power to grant mercy petitions only for state offenses.
4. The Supreme Court can review decisions on mercy petitions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; mercy petitions are typically filed by those sentenced to death or life imprisonment,  not everyone convicted of a crime. Statement 2 is incorrect; the President's pardoning power extends to both Union and State offenses. Statement 3 is incorrect; Governors also have pardoning powers for offenses under state laws. Statement 4 is correct; the Supreme Court has the power to review decisions on mercy petitions, though this power is limited. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include false statements.  This question tests understanding of the judicial review mechanism regarding mercy petitions and the scope of pardoning powers of the President and Governors, demanding analysis and evaluation of legal provisions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                     Key Feature
1. The Postal Services Act, 2023              Financial Inclusion
2. The Telecommunications Act, 2023           Interception of messages
3. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996:  Granting tribal communities control over natural resources
4. The Census Act, 1948                       Provides for the decennial census


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Postal Services Act, 2023, while contributing to financial inclusion, its primary focus is on postal services. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, does indeed include provisions for interception of messages under certain circumstances. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, explicitly aims at granting tribal communities greater control over natural resources. The Census Act, 1948, provides the legal framework for conducting the decennial census.  Therefore, three pairs (2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs. This question demands application of knowledge to assess the accuracy of statements linking specific laws to their key features, requiring conceptual understanding of each law's purpose.


**9. With reference to the Pro-tem Speaker of Lok Sabha, consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                     Truth Value
1. The post is mentioned in the Constitution     True
2. Administering oaths to new MPs is a primary duty  True
3.  Elected by the Lok Sabha                      False
4. Appointed by the President                     True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The post of Pro-tem Speaker is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, but the practice is established by convention.  Administering oaths to newly elected MPs is a key function of the Pro-tem Speaker. The Pro-tem Speaker is appointed by the President, not elected by the Lok Sabha. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit or include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of parliamentary procedures and the constitutional basis for such procedures, requiring both factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body             Article Number
1.  Finance Commission              Article 280
2.  Election Commission             Article 324
3.  Inter-State Council             Article 263
4.  National Human Rights Commission  Article 324

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission is established under Article 280.  The Election Commission is established under Article 324.  The Inter-State Council is established under Article 263.  The National Human Rights Commission is not directly established by Article 324; that article deals with the Election Commission. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly matched pairs or omission of correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall of constitutional provisions relating to crucial constitutional bodies and their establishment, demanding precise knowledge of article numbers.


**11. With reference to the National Anthem, consider the following pairs:**

  Statement                                       Truth Value
1.  It was first sung on 27th December 1911     False
2.  It is written in Devanagari script              True
3.  It is a fundamental right to sing it            False
4.  Showing respect is a fundamental duty          True


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Anthem was first sung on December 27, 1911, at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress, not in 1929. It is written in Sanskrit and translated into Devanagari script. Singing the National Anthem is not a fundamental right, but showing respect is a fundamental duty.  Therefore, only two pairs (2 and 4) are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they incorrectly state the number of correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the National Anthem and its associated facts, requiring factual recall and understanding of fundamental rights and duties.


**12. With reference to the Union List, consider the following pairs:**

   Subject Matter                                  Inclusion Status
1.  Atomic Energy                                  Included
2.  Inter-State Rivers                             Included
3.  Agriculture                                    Excluded
4.  Education                                      Excluded
5.  Police                                          Included


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Atomic energy, inter-state rivers, and police are included in the Union List. Agriculture and education are state subjects, falling under the State List. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or omit correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, requiring accurate recall of subject matter allocation.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article/Schedule           Power/Function
1. Article 200                                    Governor's assent to bills
2. Article 213                                    President's ordinance-making power
3. Tenth Schedule                                 Anti-defection law
4. Seventh Schedule                             Distribution of powers between Union and States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 200 correctly describes the Governor's power to assent to bills. Article 213 pertains to the Governor's ordinance-making power, not the President's. The Tenth Schedule correctly relates to the anti-defection law. The Seventh Schedule correctly outlines the distribution of powers between the Union and the States.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or omit correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's ability to link specific constitutional articles and schedules to their functions within the Indian governmental structure, demanding both factual recall and understanding of the Indian Constitution.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

    Statement                                          Truth Value
1.  The President can address Parliament's joint sitting.       True
2.  The President's address to Parliament is mandatory.        False
3.  The Indian Independence Act, 1947 established this practice. False
4.  Article 87 governs the President's address to Parliament.   True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The President can indeed address Parliament's joint sitting as per Article 87.  The address is not mandatory; it's a convention. The practice predates the Indian Independence Act, 1947;  it evolved over time. Article 87 deals with the President's address to Parliament. Therefore, two pairs (1 and 4) are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they wrongly state the number of correctly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of parliamentary procedures and the President's role in them, demanding both factual recall and the ability to distinguish between facts and conventions.  The distractor in option 3 plays on the common association of the Indian Independence Act with the commencement of many parliamentary practices.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                        Provision/Effect
1.  The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973:  Statutory Bail Provision
2.  The Census Act, 1948                         Conduct of Decennial Census
3.  The Telegraphs Act, 1885                       Financial Inclusion
4.  The PESA Act, 1996                           Extension to Scheduled Areas
5.  The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019: Abrogation of Article 370


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, contains provisions for statutory bail. The Census Act, 1948, governs the decennial census. The Telegraphs Act, 1885, deals with telegraphs, not directly with financial inclusion, though it might indirectly facilitate it. The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA Act), extends the provisions of the Panchayats to Scheduled Areas.  The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019, led to the abrogation of Article 370. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various acts and their effects, demanding precise knowledge of the scope of each law.  The distractor in option 3 utilizes the plausible connection between telegraphs and financial inclusion to mislead the candidate.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', achieved through the use of closely related distractors and requiring accurate factual recall.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Political Figure              Office Held
1. Narendra Modi                 :  Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
2. Jawaharlal Nehru               :  Third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India
3. Atal Bihari Vajpayee           :  Second consecutive term as Prime Minister of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Narendra Modi has never held the office of Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh.  Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India and served for multiple terms, but he did not achieve a third consecutive term.  Atal Bihari Vajpayee led a coalition government that completed its full term, but he did not achieve a second consecutive term as Prime Minister.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar but incorrect information.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, making the question challenging for candidates who may have partial knowledge but lack complete accuracy.  Understanding the chronology of Prime Ministers and Chief Ministers in India is crucial for UPSC preparation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article       Subject Matter
1. Article 60                    :  President's Oath of Office
2. Article 75(1)                 :  Appointment of Ministers
3. Article 93                    :  Election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker
4. Article 94                    :  Removal of the Speaker

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Article 60 deals with the oath of office of the President. Article 75(1) outlines the appointment of the Prime Minister and other ministers. Article 93 details the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Article 94 describes the procedure for a motion of no confidence against the Speaker. The question assesses factual recall of constitutional provisions related to the executive and legislative branches of the Indian government. The options are designed to test the candidate’s comprehensive understanding of these articles, with distractors strategically placed to challenge even well-prepared candidates.  A thorough understanding of the Indian Constitution is essential for success in the UPSC examination.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Electoral System              Country
1. Proportional Representation :  United States
2. First Past the Post (FPTP)    :  Israel
3. First Past the Post (FPTP)    :  India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The United States utilizes a modified FPTP system (although it's not purely FPTP at the Presidential level due to the Electoral College), while Israel employs a proportional representation system. India uses the FPTP system for Lok Sabha elections.  This question tests factual knowledge about different electoral systems and their application in various countries. The distractors play on the common misconception that the US exclusively uses FPTP and that Israel uses FPTP.  Understanding different electoral systems and their impact on political representation is vital for the UPSC exam.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                          Special Category Status
1. Telangana                      : Granted in 2014
2. Andhra Pradesh                : Granted in 1969
3. Jammu & Kashmir (now UT)     : Granted in 1969

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first and third pairs are correctly matched. Telangana was granted special category status after its formation in 2014. Jammu & Kashmir was granted special category status in 1969. Andhra Pradesh was not granted special category status in 1969; this is a distractor designed to test knowledge of the historical context of SCS. This question tests factual knowledge about the special category status granted to states in India. The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s understanding of the timeline and the states that received this status. A deep understanding of India's federal structure and developmental policies is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment    Provision
1. 97th Amendment              : Right to form cooperative societies as a fundamental right
2. 91st Amendment              : Limit on the number of ministers
3. 24th Amendment               :  Right to constitutional remedies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first and second pairs are correctly matched. The 97th Amendment Act added a new Article 19(1)(c) to include the right to form cooperative societies as a fundamental right.  The 91st Amendment Act introduced a cap on the number of ministers in the Council of Ministers. The 24th Amendment Act dealt with the fundamental rights and the power of judicial review, not the right to constitutional remedies. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of specific constitutional amendments and their impact on various aspects of Indian governance. The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's ability to discriminate between closely related but incorrect information.  Knowing the key features of various constitutional amendments is essential for UPSC preparation.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Disaster Management Act, 2005:**

1.  The Act allows states to draw money from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).
2.  States contribute 25% of the money to the SDRF (10% for special category states), with the remaining amount coming from the Centre.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, establishes a two-tiered funding mechanism for disaster management: the NDRF at the national level and the SDRF at the state level. States are required to contribute a percentage of the SDRF funds, while the Centre provides the rest. This question assesses the candidate’s understanding of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and its financial provisions. The options are straightforward, testing the candidate’s recall of key features of the Act.  Understanding disaster management policies and their implementation is important for UPSC.



**7. With reference to the principle of Collective Responsibility, consider the following statements:**

1.  Decisions are taken collectively by the Cabinet.
2.  Ministers are individually responsible to the Lok Sabha.
3.  The Prime Minister can recommend the dismissal of a minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The principle of collective responsibility dictates that the Cabinet takes decisions collectively.  The Prime Minister has the power to recommend the dismissal of a minister to the President. However, Ministers are collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, not individually. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of the principle of collective responsibility in the Indian parliamentary system. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate’s understanding of the nuances of ministerial accountability.  A clear understanding of the Indian political system is crucial for UPSC.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                         Position Held
1. Narendra Modi                  : Third consecutive term as Prime Minister
2. Jawaharlal Nehru               : Second consecutive term as Prime Minister
3. Atal Bihari Vajpayee           : First coalition government to complete its full term


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the first and third pairs are correctly matched.  Narendra Modi is the second Indian Prime Minister to achieve three consecutive terms. Atal Bihari Vajpayee led the first NDA government to complete its full term. Jawaharlal Nehru served multiple terms as Prime Minister, but not consecutively. This question tests factual recall and understanding of Indian political history, specifically concerning Prime Ministers and their tenures.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's precise knowledge.  A solid understanding of Indian history and politics is essential for the UPSC examination.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                     Key Feature
1. Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 : Establishes the National Human Rights Commission
2. Representation of the People Act, 1951:  Governs the conduct of elections
3. Consumer Protection Act, 2019       : Regulates misleading advertisements


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, established the NHRC. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, governs the conduct of elections in India.  The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, provides for the regulation of misleading advertisements. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of significant acts and their main features. The inclusion of all three correctly matched pairs makes this a challenging question.  Understanding the legal framework governing various aspects of Indian society is key to UPSC success.



**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India:**

1.  The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners.
2.  The Election Commission decides the election schedule.
3.  The Election Commission resolves disputes relating to splits/mergers of recognized political parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct.  The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners. The Election Commission of India is responsible for deciding the election schedule. The Election Commission also resolves disputes related to the splits and mergers of recognized political parties. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the Election Commission's powers and functions.  The options are designed to test the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the ECI's role in the Indian electoral system.  A thorough understanding of the Election Commission's role is crucial for UPSC.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                     Position Held
    1. Lal Bahadur Shastri      :  President of India
    2. Indira Gandhi           :  Prime Minister of India
    3. Morarji Desai            :  Governor of West Bengal
    4. Rajiv Gandhi             :  Chief Justice of India
    5. Jawaharlal Nehru         :  Prime Minister of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru both served as Prime Ministers of India.  Option (a) correctly identifies these two accurate pairings.  The other options include incorrect pairings. Lal Bahadur Shastri was never President of India; that role was held by others like Rajendra Prasad and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed.  Morarji Desai was never the Governor of West Bengal;  Rajiv Gandhi never held the position of Chief Justice of India. The distractors are designed to be plausible, drawing on knowledge of prominent Indian figures and their roles in government, but ultimately incorrect in this specific context.  The question tests factual recall regarding specific individuals and their positions in the Indian government.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Article of the Indian Constitution       Subject Matter
    1. Article 3                               :  Amendment of State Names
    2. Article 99                              :  Oath of Members of Parliament
    3. Article 270                             :  Prohibition of Taxes
    4. Article 51A                             :  Fundamental Duties
    5. Article 21                              :  Freedom of Artistic Expression


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Indian Constitution deals with the formation of new states and alteration of areas, boundaries, or names of existing states, including the power to change state names. Article 99 details the oath or affirmation that members of Parliament must take before assuming their seats. Article 51A outlines the Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens.  These three pairs are correctly matched.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of taxes between the Union and States, not the prohibition of taxes (that's Article 265). Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, but does not specifically address freedom of artistic expression (that's implicitly covered under Article 19(1)(a)). The question tests knowledge of specific articles and their corresponding subject matters within the Indian Constitution, demanding accurate factual recall and understanding of constitutional provisions.


**3. With reference to the Indian President and Prime Minister, consider the following pairs:**

    Power/Responsibility                    Held by
    1. Appointing the Prime Minister       :   President
    2. Recommending dismissal of a Minister :   Prime Minister
    3. Pardoning offenses under Union laws:  Governor
    4.  Dissolving the Lok Sabha           :  Prime Minister


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister recommends the dismissal of a minister (though the President makes the final decision). These are correctly matched. The other options present incorrect attributions of power.  The President, not the Governor, pardons offenses under Union laws; the President, not the Prime Minister, has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha.  The question evaluates understanding of the distribution of executive powers between the President and the Prime Minister in the Indian political system, requiring precise knowledge of their respective constitutional roles and responsibilities.  The distractors test knowledge of other related powers, creating a challenging scenario for the examinee.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment                            Key Feature
    1.  The Post Office Act, 1898             :   Repealed in 2023
    2.  Telecommunications Act, 2023        :   Repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885
    3.  The Census Act, 1948                 :   First conducted in 1871
    4.  The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 :   Made Article 370 applicable to J&K


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act, 2023, aims to repeal existing legislative frameworks like the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraph Act, 1933.  The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019, made provisions of the Indian Constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. These are correctly matched. The Post Office Act, 1898, was *amended*, not repealed, in 2023. The first complete census in India was conducted in 1881, not 1871.  The question tests the examinee's understanding of specific legislation and their key features, requiring precise knowledge of the acts and amendments. The distractors are designed to be plausible inaccuracies, demanding careful consideration and accurate recall.



**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body/Position           Primary Function/Responsibility
    1. Speaker Pro Tem                     : Administering oaths to new MPs
    2. National Council for Transgender Persons: Advising the Central Government on Transgender policies
    3.  State Finance Commission            :  Recommending principles for tax devolution between Union and States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Speaker Pro Tem's primary duty is administering oaths to newly elected Members of Parliament. The National Council for Transgender Persons advises the Central Government on policies related to transgender persons.  These are correctly matched. The State Finance Commission reviews the financial position of Panchayats and makes recommendations to improve their financial standing; it does *not* recommend principles for tax devolution between the Union and States (that's the responsibility of the Central Finance Commission, as per Article 280).  The question tests the examinee's knowledge of constitutional bodies and their functions, requiring precise understanding of their roles and responsibilities. The distractor incorporates a similar-sounding but incorrect function, increasing the difficulty level.


These questions demonstrate the required format and difficulty level, focusing on factual recall and analytical skills relevant to the UPSC exam.  They avoid ambiguity and utilize plausible distractors to challenge the examinee's understanding of the subject matter.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is assessed as "difficult" due to the close similarity of distractors and the need for precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution          Provision Related To
1. Article 93                             : Election of the Speaker of Lok Sabha
2. Article 87                             : President's Address to both Houses of Parliament
3. Article 213                            : Governor's power to promulgate Ordinances
4. Article 123                            : President's power to promulgate Ordinances
5. Article 130                            : Supreme Court's location of sittings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 93 deals with the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha, not just the Speaker.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. Article 87 correctly outlines the President's power to address Parliament. Article 213 accurately describes the Governor's ordinance-making power. Article 123 correctly details the President's power to promulgate ordinances.  Article 130 correctly states that the Supreme Court can sit in Delhi or other places appointed by the CJI with the President's approval. Thus, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                          Subject Matter
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act  :  Constitutionalization of Municipalities
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act  :  Constitutionalization of Panchayats
3. PESA Act, 1996                         : Extension of Panchayati Raj to Scheduled Areas
4. 42nd Amendment Act                   :  Freezing of Lok Sabha seat allocation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Amendment Act constitutionalized Panchayati Raj Institutions, and the 74th Amendment Act constitutionalized urban local governments.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrectly matched.  The PESA Act, 1996, correctly extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution (relating to Panchayats) to Scheduled Areas. The 42nd Amendment Act did indeed freeze Lok Sabha seat allocation based on the 1971 census, making pair 4 correct.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Constitutional Article           Power/Function

Article 123 grants the *President*, not the Governor, the power to promulgate ordinances during parliamentary recess.  Article 213 correctly refers to the Governor's power to issue ordinances. Article 137 correctly describes the Supreme Court's power of review. Article 161 correctly gives the Governor the power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., similar to the President's power under Article 72.

**Explanation:**

The Emblems and Names Act primarily protects the names and symbols of specified dignitaries, not all deceased personalities. Section 499 of the IPC correctly defines defamation. Section 432 of the CrPC correctly outlines the government's power regarding sentence suspension or remission. Article 21 of the Constitution correctly guarantees the right to privacy. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, correctly establishes the CCPA. Therefore only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.

(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC is correctly identified as being established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  The maximum strength of Supreme Court judges *can* be determined by Parliament, as per Article 124(1). The AFT correctly possesses the powers of a civil court.  The CCPA correctly regulates misleading advertisements under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 352 deals with National Emergency, not President's Rule (which is Article 356). Article 360 correctly defines the Financial Emergency. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Emergency                     Consequences for Lok Sabha
1. National Emergency                      : Possible extension of its term

(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Senkaku Islands are disputed between Japan and China, not Japan and the USA. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are correctly described as separated by the Eight Degree Channel. The Netherlands does *not* border Switzerland. The Siang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh is correctly identified as the home of the Adi tribe.

    5.  Deepor Beel                     :  A Ramsar site located in Assam


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Assam is indeed the largest tea producer in India. The Brahmaputra Valley is a significant geographical region entirely within Assam and includes the state's oldest oil-producing areas. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is in Assam and is home to the world's largest breeding colony of the Greater Adjutant stork. Majuli is renowned as the world's largest river island, situated on the Brahmaputra River in Assam. Finally, Deepor Beel is a Ramsar site located within Assam.  Each statement represents a well-established fact about Assam's geography, ecology, and economy, making option (a) the only correct choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more of these verifiable facts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    River                              Feature
    1. Brahmaputra                     : Flows through Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Bangladesh
    2. Subansiri                          : Major tributary of the Brahmaputra, originating in Tibet
    3.  Kopili                             : Flows through Assam and Meghalaya
    4.  Manas                             : Forms part of the boundary between Assam and Bhutan

(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Brahmaputra River's course traverses Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Bangladesh. The Subansiri River is a major tributary of the Brahmaputra, originating in Tibet.  The Manas River indeed forms part of the border between Assam and Bhutan. The Dhansiri River forms part of the boundary between Assam and Nagaland. However, the Kopili River primarily flows through Assam; while it touches the border of Meghalaya, it does not flow through Meghalaya itself. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Festival                       Month of Celebration

Magh Bihu and Bhogali Bihu are both celebrated in January, marking the end and beginning of the harvest season respectively. Kati Bihu falls in October. The Ambubachi Mela, a significant festival associated with the Kamakhya Temple, is observed in June.  Therefore, option (a) is correct. Other options misrepresent the timing of one or more of the festivals.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Protected Area                   Location in Assam
    1. Kaziranga National Park         :  Known for one-horned rhinoceros

Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is a significant habitat for the Asiatic elephant. Orang National Park is situated in the Brahmaputra Valley. The Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary is known for its Golden Langur population. Therefore, option (a) is the only correct answer.  Other options misrepresent the characteristics or locations of one or more protected areas in Assam.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Art Form/Cultural Practice        State/Region
    1. Sattriya Dance                  : Assam
    2.  Ankia Naat                     : Assam
    3.  Ojapali                          : Assam
    4.  Bagurumba                       : Assam
    5.  Bhaona                           : Assam

(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Sattriya dance, Ankia Naat, Ojapali, Bagurumba, and Bhaona are all significant art forms and cultural practices that originated and are predominantly practiced in Assam.  Therefore, option (a) is the only correct answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more of these well-known Assamese cultural elements.  The question tests factual recall of Assamese culture.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, using plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    River System                      Originating Country
    1. Indus River System               :  Nepal
    2. Brahmaputra River System        :  China
    3. Ganges River System              :  India
    4. Mekong River System              :  Bhutan
    5. Yangtze River System            :  Pakistan

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 2 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only statement 2 is correctly matched. The Brahmaputra River originates in China.  The other options are incorrect due to inaccurate pairings of river systems and their originating countries.  The Indus River originates in the Himalayas, encompassing parts of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and China. The Ganges River also originates in the Himalayas, primarily in India.  The Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau, and the Yangtze River originates in the Tibetan Plateau, both in China.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Indus River does not originate solely in Nepal. Option (b) is partially correct in matching Brahmaputra and Ganges but incorrect in its other pairings. Option (d) is incorrect because at least one pair is correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall of geographical knowledge related to major Asian river systems.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                          Bordering State/Union Territory of India
    1. Bangladesh                     :  Gujarat
    2. Bhutan                          :  Mizoram
    3. Myanmar                         :  Arunachal Pradesh
    4. Pakistan                        :  Sikkim
    5. Afghanistan                    :  West Bengal

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1, 2 and 3 only
    (b) 3 and 5 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only statement 3 is correctly matched. Myanmar shares a border with Arunachal Pradesh, a state in northeastern India. The other options provide incorrect pairings.  Bangladesh shares a border with several Indian states, including West Bengal, but not Gujarat. Bhutan borders several Indian states including West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, but not Mizoram. Pakistan shares a border with several Indian states, including Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat, but not Sikkim. Afghanistan borders India in the far northwest but not West Bengal. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's geopolitical borders and their understanding of the geographical location of neighboring countries. The inclusion of plausible distractors like Gujarat and Sikkim makes the question challenging.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Location                 Significance
    1. Saipan                              :   Capital of Northern Mariana Islands
    2. Estonia                             :    Baltic country
    3. Golden Triangle                     :   Major opium-producing region in South America
    4. Lake Natron                        :   Ramsar site in East Africa
    5. Mariana Islands Archipelago       :   Located in the Atlantic Ocean

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 5 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a). Saipan is indeed the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands; Estonia is a Baltic country; and Lake Natron is a Ramsar site in East Africa.  The other options present incorrect information. The Golden Triangle is a major opium-producing region in Southeast Asia (not South America). The Mariana Islands Archipelago is located in the western Pacific Ocean (not the Atlantic Ocean). Option (b) is partially correct but omits the correct matching for Estonia. Option (c) contains two incorrect matches. Option (d) is incorrect because at least three pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of geography, political geography, and current affairs, integrating information from different geographical contexts.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect information regarding the Golden Triangle and the Mariana Islands makes this a challenging question.


**4. With reference to Government Schemes/Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme                                 Key Feature
    1. Agnipath Scheme                     :   Recruits for eight years
    2. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural) :   Financial assistance of ₹1.60 lakh
    3. GREAT Scheme                        :   Grant-in-aid exclusively for individual entrepreneurs
    4. Digital Health Incentive Scheme    :   Applicable only to private hospitals
    5. Krishi Sakhi                         :   Trained for 28 days


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 2 and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 5 only
    (c) 2 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural) indeed provides financial assistance (the exact amount may vary by region and other factors, but the statement is generally true). The other statements are incorrect. Agnipath recruits for four years, not eight. The GREAT scheme is open to startups and companies in addition to individual entrepreneurs. The Digital Health Incentive Scheme is applicable to both public and private hospitals. Krishi Sakhis are trained for more than 28 days. Option (a) is incorrect because only one of the pairs is correct. Option (b) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because at least one pair is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various Indian government schemes and their features.  The use of slightly altered or incorrect details in the distractor pairs enhances the difficulty level, demanding precise knowledge of the schemes.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Operation                     Location
    1. Operation Blue Star           :  Amritsar
    2. Operation Smiling Buddha      :  Pokhran
    3. Operation Meghdoot           :  Siachen Glacier
    4. Operation Cactus              :  Maldives
    5. Operation Vijay              :  Kargil


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because Operations Smiling Buddha (Pokhran), Meghdoot (Siachen Glacier), and Cactus (Maldives) are correctly paired. Operation Blue Star was indeed related to the Golden Temple complex, but it is located in Amritsar. Operation Vijay was associated with the Kargil conflict, but the location is not limited to Kargil itself; the war encompassed a wider region. Option (a) is incorrect due to the incorrect location for Operation Blue Star. Option (c) is partially correct but omits Operation Cactus. Option (d) is incorrect because not all pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant Indian military operations and their locations.  The use of slightly altered locations or related but incorrect operations increases the difficulty level, demanding precise recall and analytical ability.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    App                                 Purpose
    1. eSakshya App                     :  Blue Economy initiatives
    2. Aarogya Setu App                 :   Contact tracing during a pandemic
    3. COWIN App                         :   COVID-19 vaccine registration
    4. BHIM App                           :   Digital payments
    5. UMANG App                         :   Government services access


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
    (c) 1 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  Aarogya Setu was used for contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic; COWIN facilitated COVID-19 vaccine registration; BHIM is a digital payments app; and UMANG provides access to various government services. The pairing of eSakshya App with Blue Economy initiatives is incorrect; eSakshya is related to skill development for women in rural areas.  Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing for UMANG. Option (c) is incorrect because only one pair is accurately matched and Option (d) is incorrect because several pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various mobile applications used in India and their functions.

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Bangladesh borders the Bay of Bengal. The other options are incorrect due to inaccurate pairings of geographical locations and their nearest major water bodies. Estonia is bordered by the Baltic Sea, not the North Sea. Saipan is in the Pacific Ocean, not the Indian Ocean. Tanzania borders the Indian Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean. Iran borders the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, not the Red Sea. Option (a) is incorrect as both pairs are wrong. Option (c) is partially correct but incorrect about Tanzania. Option (d) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall of geographical knowledge and the ability to match countries with their surrounding water bodies. The inclusion of plausible distractors enhances the question’s difficulty. The question tests the candidate's understanding of coastal geography and regional seas.

    (b) 3 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correctly matched. Carrantuohill is the highest peak in Ireland.  The other options incorrectly pair countries with their highest peaks. Mount Fuji is the highest peak in Japan, not Estonia. Mount Paektu is the highest peak in North Korea, not Ireland. Mount Kenya is the second highest peak in Kenya, not Romania. Mount Moldoveanu is the highest peak in Romania, not Tanzania.  Option (a) is incorrect as both pairs are wrong. Option (b) is incorrect; Mount Kenya is not the highest peak in Romania. Option (d) is incorrect because at least one pairing is correct. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of geographical features, specifically the highest peaks in various countries.  The use of distractors that are geographically relevant but incorrect increases the difficulty level. The question demands precise recall of geographical information.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correctly matched. Amsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands. The other options incorrectly pair countries with their capital cities. Riga is the capital of Latvia, not Estonia. Praia is the capital of Cabo Verde, not Ireland. Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria, not Romania. Dublin is the capital of Ireland, not Cabo Verde. Option (a) is incorrect as Riga is not the capital of Estonia. Option (b) is incorrect; Praia and Sofia are not the capitals of Ireland and Romania respectively. Option (d) is incorrect as Dublin is not the capital city of Cabo Verde. This question assesses factual recall of capital cities of different countries.  The use of distractors that are plausible but incorrect makes this a challenging question.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of political geography.

     Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

     (a) 3 and 4 only
     (b) 3, 4, and 5 only
     (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
     (d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). Lake Natron is located in northern Tanzania; Lake Retba is in Senegal; and Lake Titicaca is situated in the Andes Mountains (spanning Peru and Bolivia). Lake Urmia is located in Iran, and Lake Hamoun is on the border of Iran and Afghanistan.  Option (a) is partially correct but doesn't include Lake Titicaca. Option (c) is incorrect because Lake Urmia and Lake Hamoun are not located in Tanzania and Kazakhstan respectively. Option (d) is incorrect because at least three pairs are correctly matched.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, primarily factual recall and analysis, with plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme             Implementing Ministry
    1. PMAY-U                         : Ministry of Rural Development
    2. PMAY-G                         : Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
    3.  National Offshore Wind Energy Policy : Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
    4.  Namami Gange Yojana          : Ministry of Jal Shakti

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) has two main components: PMAY-U (Urban) implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and PMAY-G (Gramin/Rural) implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrectly matched.  The National Offshore Wind Energy Policy falls under the purview of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, making pair 3 correct.  Finally, the Namami Gange Yojana, focused on the rejuvenation of the River Ganga, is implemented under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, correctly matching pair 4.  Option (d) accurately reflects the correct pairings. Options (a), (b), and (c) contain incorrect pairings due to a misunderstanding of the implementing ministries for PMAY-U and PMAY-G.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme              Key Funding Source
    1. PMAY-U                         : World Bank Loan
    2. PMAY-G                         : Beneficiary Contribution
    3. Atal Bhujal Yojana             : Public Expenditure
    4.  AMD-CF Scheme                : Private Investment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PMAY-U's funding mechanism involves a combination of public expenditure, private investment, and beneficiary contributions; therefore, pairing 1 is incorrect.  PMAY-G does involve beneficiary contributions as part of its funding, making pair 2 a correct match. Atal Bhujal Yojana utilizes a blend of World Bank loans and budgetary support, making pairing 3 incorrect. The AMD-CF scheme primarily focuses on financial assistance, largely from public funds via SIDBI, thus rendering pairing 4 incorrect. Only pair 2 accurately reflects a key funding source.  Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrect pairings due to an incomplete understanding of the funding sources for these schemes.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Program            Salient Feature
    1.  Krishi Sakhi                    : 56-day training program
    2.  GREAT scheme                  : Grant-in-aid up to ₹50 lakh

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Krishi Sakhi program under Lakhpati Didi indeed involves a 56-day training module for rural women, making pair 1 correct.  The GREAT scheme (Grant-in-Aid for Technical Textiles) offers grant-in-aid up to ₹50 lakh, correctly matching pair 2. The Central Sector Scheme for digitizing health records provides an incentive of ₹20 per record beyond a monthly threshold of 100, accurately matching pair 3. Lastly, the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme specifically targets offshore wind energy projects, making pair 4 correct. Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.



**4. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), consider the following pairs:**

    PMAY Component                Eligibility Criterion (Partial)
    1. PMAY-U (Urban)              : Annual household income up to Rs. 6 Lakh
    2. PMAY-G (Rural)              :  Assistance of Rs. 1.30 lakh in hilly states
    3. Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme : Available to Middle Income Groups

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PMAY-U's eligibility includes Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) with annual income up to Rs. 3 Lakh, not Rs. 6 Lakh, making pair 1 incorrect.  PMAY-G provides financial assistance of Rs. 1.30 lakh in hilly and difficult areas, making pair 2 correct. The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) is indeed available to Middle Income Groups (MIG), in addition to other income groups, thus making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include pair 1, which misrepresents the income eligibility for PMAY-U.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Ministry          Scheme Administered
    1. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs: Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0
    2. Ministry of Rural Development : Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NMCG's role in the Namami Gange Yojana includes the target mentioned, making pair 1 correct. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is responsible for providing scientific inputs for groundwater management, not for empanelling National WASH Experts; that role belongs to the National Centre for Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Quality, making pair 2 incorrect. The National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) facilitates claim settlement and payment tracking, not the processing of hyper-local weather data; that is the function of the WINDS portal, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) erroneously include pairs 2 and/or 3.


**7. With reference to the various government schemes mentioned, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Feature                     Specific Program

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PM-KISAN scheme aims to provide income support to eligible farmer families, making pair 1 correct. PMFBY seeks to financially support farmers facing crop losses and stabilize their income, making pair 2 correct. Atal Bhujal Yojana focuses on community-led sustainable groundwater management, making pair 3 correct.  PMJVK aims for the socio-economic development of minority concentration areas, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only Kaziranga National Park is correctly paired with its state, Assam.  Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary is located in Madhya Pradesh, not Gujarat. Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary is situated in Assam, not Mizoram. Bhitarkanika National Park is in Odisha, not West Bengal. Kanha National Park is located in Madhya Pradesh, not Uttarakhand.  The question tests factual recall of the location of various protected areas in India.  The distractors are carefully chosen to include states geographically close to the actual locations, increasing the difficulty level and requiring precise knowledge for correct matching.


**2. With reference to the IUCN Red List, consider the following pairs:**

   Species                      IUCN Status

4.  Wild Boar                :   Vulnerable
5.  Asian King Vulture        :   Endangered

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Javan Rhino is indeed listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Iberian Lynx is listed as Vulnerable, not Least Concern, and the Wild Boar is listed as Least Concern, not Vulnerable.  Option (b) is incorrect because the Saltwater Crocodile is listed as Least Concern, not Near Threatened, and the Asian King Vulture is Critically Endangered, not Endangered. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes incorrect IUCN statuses for the Iberian Lynx and Saltwater Crocodile. This question assesses factual recall of IUCN conservation statuses, which are essential for understanding global biodiversity threats. The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the conservation status of these species, demanding accurate factual recall rather than inferential reasoning.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Park/Reserve     River
1.  Kaziranga National Park :   Manas River
2.  Pench Tiger Reserve    :   Brahmani River
3.  Bhitarkanika National Park:   Baitarani River
4.  Orang National Park     :   Brahmaputra River


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Bhitarkanika National Park is correctly paired with the Baitarani River.  Orang National Park is situated along the Brahmaputra River. Option (a) is incorrect because the Diphlu River, not the Manas, flows through Kaziranga National Park; and the Pench River, not the Brahmani, is associated with Pench Tiger Reserve. Option (b) is incorrect because it only includes the correctly matched pair of Bhitarkanika and Baitarani but ignores Orang and Brahmaputra. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pairs of Kaziranga and Manas, and Pench and Brahmani. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical location of national parks and their relation to river systems, requiring precise factual recall rather than general understanding. The distractors are designed to test detailed knowledge of river systems and their association with specific protected areas.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/Union Territory    Protected Area
1.  Odisha                  :   Galathea National Park
2.  Assam                   :   Mukurthi National Park
3.  Tamil Nadu              :   Kaziranga National Park
4.  Andaman & Nicobar Islands:   Similipal Tiger Reserve
5.  Karnataka               :   Bhitarkanika National Park

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Galathea National Park is located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, not Odisha. Mukurthi National Park is in Tamil Nadu, not Assam. Kaziranga National Park is in Assam, not Tamil Nadu. Similipal Tiger Reserve is in Odisha, not the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Bhitarkanika National Park is in Odisha, not Karnataka. This question assesses the candidate's detailed knowledge of the location of protected areas across different states and Union Territories in India. The difficulty arises from the numerous plausible but incorrect pairings, demanding precise factual recall of the geographical distribution of these important conservation areas.  The absence of any correct pairings emphasizes the importance of accurate factual knowledge in this area.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                     Causative Agent
1. Malaria                       :    Plasmodium ovale
2. Tuberculosis                 :    Mycobacterium tuberculosis
3. COVID-19                     :    Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
4. Antimicrobial Resistance   :   Staphylococcus aureus
5. Malaria                       :    Plasmodium falciparum


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because it accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs.  *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium vivax* are indeed causative agents of malaria (although the prompt only explicitly mentions *falciparum*).  *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* causes tuberculosis, and SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19.  *Staphylococcus aureus* is a bacterium that can develop antibiotic resistance, contributing to the broader issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  *Plasmodium ovale* is a less common cause of malaria, making option (a) incorrect. Option (b) omits the correct pairing of malaria with *Plasmodium falciparum*. Option (d) incorrectly includes the association of  *Staphylococcus aureus* with AMR as a direct causal relationship rather than a contributing factor.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of disease etiology.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease Category              Specific Disease
1. Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) :   Dengue fever
2. Vector-borne Diseases          :   Malaria
3.  Infectious Diseases             :   Tuberculosis
4.  Antimicrobial Resistance      :   COVID-19
5. Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs):   Leprosy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Malaria is a vector-borne disease, and tuberculosis is an infectious disease. Leprosy is classified as an NTD.  Option (a) is incorrect as Dengue fever, while vector-borne, isn't typically classified as an NTD. Option (b) is incomplete; it misses the correct pairing of leprosy with NTDs. Option (d) is incorrect as COVID-19 is not directly caused by antimicrobial resistance; rather, the overuse of antibiotics during the pandemic has contributed to the rise of AMR. This question assesses factual recall and categorization of diseases.


**3. With reference to Malaria, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                          Detail
1.  Vector                           :    Aedes aegypti
2.  Vaccine (currently in use)     :    RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix)
3.  Preventive measure               :    Gene drive technology
4.  Causative agent                 :    Plasmodium vivax
5.  Global initiative target      :     Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) correctly matches the aspects of malaria. RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) is a malaria vaccine currently in use.  *Plasmodium vivax* is a causative agent of malaria. The SDGs include targets related to malaria eradication. Option (a) is incorrect because *Aedes aegypti* is the vector for dengue fever, not malaria.  The vector for malaria is *Anopheles* species. Option (b) misses the SDG connection and the gene drive technology as a potential preventive measure. Option (c) incorrectly includes *Aedes aegypti* and omits the SDGs. This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect different aspects of a disease.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vaccine                     Disease
1. RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix)       :    Tuberculosis
2. R21/Matrix-M                :    Malaria
3.  BCG                          :    Tuberculosis
4.  Measles vaccine             :    Measles
5.  HPV vaccine                  :    Human Papillomavirus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. R21/Matrix-M is a malaria vaccine, BCG is a tuberculosis vaccine, and the measles vaccine targets measles. The HPV vaccine protects against Human Papillomavirus.  Option (a) is incorrect because RTS,S/AS01 is a malaria vaccine, not a tuberculosis vaccine. Option (b) incorrectly pairs RTS,S with tuberculosis.  Option (d) incorrectly includes the pairing of RTS,S/AS01 with tuberculosis. This question tests factual recall of vaccines and the diseases they target.


**5. With reference to the  Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Dimension                     Indicator
1. Economic Participation and Opportunity :  Wage gap
2. Educational Attainment           :  Literacy rate
3. Health and Survival              :  Life expectancy
4. Political Empowerment            :  Parliamentary representation
5. Economic Participation and Opportunity :  Unemployment rate


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. All the pairs show accurate indicators used within the respective dimensions of the Global Gender Gap Report.  The wage gap, literacy rate, and life expectancy are all relevant indicators for economic participation, educational attainment, and health, respectively.  Parliamentary representation measures political empowerment.  The unemployment rate is also a key indicator of economic participation and opportunity. There are no incorrect pairings in this set.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the components of a specific report.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Area of Focus
1. World Health Organization (WHO):   Antimicrobial Resistance

1. New Zealand                   :   Introduction of a carbon tax on agriculture
2. Brazil                          :   Removal of the 'burp tax' on livestock
3. India                           :   Constitution of a high-level committee on examination conduct
4.  New Zealand                   :   Launch of the world's first carbon tax on livestock
5. India                           :  Implementation of a carbon tax on agriculture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. New Zealand has indeed introduced a carbon tax on agriculture, and Brazil has removed the 'burp tax' on livestock.  Option (a) is incomplete, missing the correct pairing for Brazil. Option (c) is incorrect because the  Indian government did constitute a high-level committee, but not specifically focused on a carbon tax.  Option (d) includes the incorrect statement about New Zealand launching a carbon tax on livestock.  The question tests factual recall of recent policy actions in different countries.



**8. Consider the following statements:**

1. The India Post Office Act of 1854 was introduced under Lord Dalhousie's reforms.
2. The India Post Office Act of 1854 established the office of Director General of Posts for the entire country.
3. India Post has the most widely distributed postal network in the world.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Statement 1 is correct, as the India Post Office Act of 1854 was indeed part of Lord Dalhousie's administrative reforms. Statement 3 is also correct; India Post boasts a vast and extensive network. However, Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act didn't establish a single Director General position for the whole country at that time. The structure of the postal service evolved over time. This question tests knowledge of Indian administrative history and the present-day postal system.



**9. With reference to the Kafala system, consider the following statements:**

1. The system defines the relationship between foreign workers and their local sponsor, who is usually their employer.
2. Under the Kafala system, workers require their sponsor’s permission to end employment and leave the host country.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Statement 1 accurately describes the Kafala system's core function: linking foreign workers to local sponsors (typically employers). Statement 2 is also correct; the Kafala system traditionally requires sponsor permission for workers to change jobs or leave the country. This restrictive aspect has drawn significant criticism from human rights organizations.  The question tests knowledge of this often-criticized labor system.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Role/Position
1. Ashok Gulati                  :   Head of High-Level Committee on Examination Conduct

   Global Goal (NTDs, 2030)    Description
1. Eradication of all NTDs     :   Roadmap: 'Ending the Neglect'
2. Reduce NTDs by 50%         :   Roadmap: 'Ending the Neglect'
3. Reduce NTDs by 90%         :   Roadmap: 'Ending the Neglect'
4. Contain the spread of NTDs :   Roadmap: 'Ending the Neglect'
5. Eradication of all NTDs     :   WHO Roadmap


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) None.  While the 'Ending the Neglect' roadmap sets ambitious goals for NTDs,  complete eradication by 2030 is not a stated goal.  The roadmap aims for significant reduction, but a specific percentage (like 50% or 90%) isn't explicitly mentioned as the sole target. Containing the spread is a component, but not the overarching goal.  The question tests understanding of public health targets and the nuances of global health initiatives.  The distractors play on the common misconception that eradication is the ultimate goal for all NTDs.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization                  Reporting Authority
1. Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU-IND) :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
2. Enforcement Directorate (ED) :   Ministry of Finance
3. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)       :   Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Enforcement Directorate directly reports to the Ministry of Finance.  The other options are incorrect; the FIU-IND reports to the Ministry of Finance, not the RBI. The CBI reports to the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. This question tests knowledge of Indian government organizational structure and reporting lines.  The distractors are designed to be plausible given the overlapping functions of these agencies.



**15. Consider the following statements:**

1. The India Post Office Act of 1854 was introduced during the British Raj.
2.  India Post is a department under the Ministry of Communications.
3.  India Post is the world's largest postal network by volume.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Statement 1 is true as the India Post Office Act of 1854 was enacted during the British Raj.  Statement 2 is also true, as India Post functions under the Ministry of Communications. Statement 3 is false; while India Post has a large network, its claim to be the world's largest by volume is debatable and not definitively established.  This question tests knowledge of Indian history and the present structure of the postal service.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

1.  Organization Responsible for Receiving Suspect Financial Transaction Information:  Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)
2.  Ministry Overseeing the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana: Ministry of Power
3.  International Treaty Focused on Limiting Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Kyoto Protocol
4.  Country that Recently Scrapped a Livestock Emissions Tax: Australia
5.  Organization Administering the LEED India Programme: Indian Green Building Council (IGBC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND), not the CBDT, is responsible for receiving, processing, analyzing, and disseminating information related to suspect financial transactions.  The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana falls under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not the Ministry of Power.  The Kyoto Protocol is indeed an international treaty aiming to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  New Zealand, not Australia, recently scrapped a livestock emissions tax. The Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) correctly administers the LEED India Programme. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

1.  Greenhouse Gas Primarily Emitted by Enteric Fermentation: Carbon Dioxide
2.  Country with a High Population of Sheep Contributing to Greenhouse Gas Emissions: New Zealand
3.  Organization that Developed the STAR Metric for Conservation Assessment: World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
4.  Type of Hydrogen Produced Using Renewable Energy: Green Hydrogen
5.  Institution Headed by Dr. K Radhakrishnan for Examination Reform: National Testing Agency (NTA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) Only one
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Methane, not carbon dioxide, is the primary greenhouse gas emitted by enteric fermentation in livestock.  New Zealand does have a large sheep population contributing significantly to its greenhouse gas emissions. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), not WWF, developed the STAR metric. Green hydrogen is indeed produced using renewable energy sources. The high-level committee headed by Dr. K Radhakrishnan was formed to review the National Testing Agency (NTA), not to be headed by him.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.



**3. With reference to environmental policies and organizations, consider the following pairs:**

1.  Organization spearheading the One Sun, One World, One Grid initiative: International Solar Alliance (ISA)
2.  International organization that released the Adaptation Gap Report 2023: World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
3.  Indian government mission aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions through green hydrogen: National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM)
4.  Organization responsible for accrediting agencies for green hydrogen certification in India: Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
5.  Voluntary international alliance promoting the use of biodiversity credits: Biodiversity Conservation Alliance (BCA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is indeed spearheading the One Sun, One World, One Grid initiative. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), not the WMO, released the Adaptation Gap Report 2023. The National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) is an Indian government initiative aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions through green hydrogen production. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency, not BIS, is the nodal authority for accrediting agencies for green hydrogen certification in India. The Biodiversity Conservation Alliance (BCA) is a voluntary international alliance promoting biocredits.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

1.  Type of fuel produced from renewable or decarbonized electricity: Biofuel
2.  Indian Green Building Rating System: LEED
3.  Government organization responsible for implementing the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan: Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
4.  Technology used for sub-nanosecond synchronization at CERN's Large Hadron Collider: White Rabbit Technology
5.  Organization that issued warnings about mercenary spyware attacks: Google


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

E-fuels, not biofuels, are produced from renewable or decarbonized electricity. GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment), not LEED, is India's own green building rating system.  While the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways plays a role, the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan's implementation involves multiple ministries and agencies; it’s not solely under one ministry. White Rabbit Technology is correctly associated with CERN's LHC synchronization. Apple, not Google, issued warnings about mercenary spyware attacks.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to  Indian initiatives and organizations, consider the following pairs:**

1.  Organization responsible for developing the GAGAN system: ISRO
2.  Act establishing the office of the Director General of Post: Indian Telegraph Act, 1854
3.  City included in the first proposals for Wetland City Accreditation: Chennai
4.  Ministry responsible for the National Green Hydrogen Mission: Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)
5.  Organization that conducted the SpaDeX experiment: ISRO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) correctly developed the GAGAN system. The India Post Office Act of 1854, not the Indian Telegraph Act, established the Director General of Post's office. Indore, Bhopal, and Udaipur, not Chennai, were included in the first Wetland City Accreditation proposals. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not MoEFCC, is responsible for the National Green Hydrogen Mission. ISRO also correctly conducted the SpaDeX experiment.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper                     Editor/Founder
1.  Kesari                          :    Gopal Krishna Gokhale
2.  Mahratta                       :    Bal Gangadhar Tilak
3.  The Hindu                       :    Annie Besant
4.  Amrita Bazar Patrika           :    Sisir Kumar Ghosh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only pair 2 is correctly matched. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was the founder and editor of the Marathi newspaper *Mahratta* and the Hindi newspaper *Kesari*.  The other options are incorrect. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was associated with the *Servants of India Society*, not *Kesari*. Annie Besant was involved with *The Hindu*, but she wasn't its founder or primary editor; it predates her involvement significantly. Sisir Kumar Ghosh was associated with the *Amrita Bazar Patrika*, but he wasn't the sole founder or editor. The newspaper had multiple editors and contributors over its long history.  The question tests factual recall of newspaper founders and editors in the context of the Indian freedom struggle and the role of the press in shaping public opinion.  Understanding the historical context of each newspaper is crucial for accurate matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                          Association
1.  Pingali Venkayya                 :   Designed the flag of Pakistan

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. B.R. Ambedkar was the chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution. The other pairs are incorrect. Pingali Venkayya designed the Indian National Flag, not the Pakistani flag.  Madan Lal Dhingra assassinated Sir Curzon Wyllie, not Lord Curzon.  Khudiram Bose was involved in the Muzaffarpur Conspiracy Case, not the Alipore Bomb Case.  This question assesses factual recall regarding key figures in Indian history, their contributions, and their involvement in significant events. The distractors test the candidate's knowledge of related historical figures and events, requiring precise knowledge to avoid incorrect matching.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Dance Form                       State
1.  Gotipua                          :   Kerala

(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Kolattam is a traditional folk dance form of Tamil Nadu. The other options are incorrect. Gotipua is a dance form of Odisha. Kathakali is a classical dance form of Kerala. Seethakali is not primarily associated with Andhra Pradesh; it has regional variations across different states. This question tests the candidate's understanding of Indian classical and folk dance forms and their geographical origins. The distractors include other well-known dance forms and their states, demanding precise knowledge of the specific dance form and its origin.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                            Literary Work
1.  Rabindranath Tagore              :   The Life Divine

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Rabindranath Tagore authored *Gitanjali*, and M.K. Gandhi wrote *Hind Swaraj*. The other pairs are incorrect. Sri Aurobindo's major work includes *The Life Divine*, not *Gitanjali*. Bal Gangadhar Tilak didn't write *My Experiments with Truth*; that autobiography was written by Mahatma Gandhi. This question tests knowledge of prominent Indian figures and their literary works. The distractors involve closely related authors and their famous works, demanding precise knowledge of authorship.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Personality                        Award Received

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. C.V. Raman received the Bharat Ratna, and Homi Jehangir Bhabha received the Padma Vibhushan. The other pairs are incorrect. While Vikram Sarabhai was a significant figure in the Indian space program, he is not known to have received the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award.  Satyendra Nath Bose is not known for receiving a Padma Bhushan.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of awards received by prominent Indian scientists, requiring accurate recall of the specific awards received by each individual.  The distractors are designed to test the knowledge of awards and their recipients in the field of science.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Tungabhadra flows near Hampi, the Ganga flows through Varanasi, the Vaigai flows through Madurai. The Yamuna flows through Allahabad. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of major rivers in India and the cities they are associated with.  The distractors cleverly mix up rivers and cities to test precise geographical knowledge.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                             Movement/Event
1.  Madan Lal Dhingra                :   Kakori Conspiracy

(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Chandra Shekhar Azad was involved in the Lahore Conspiracy Case, and Khudiram Bose was associated with the Partition of Bengal protests.  The other pairs are incorrect. Madan Lal Dhingra was not involved in the Kakori Conspiracy; he assassinated Sir Curzon Wyllie. Ram Prasad Bismil was involved in the Kakori Conspiracy, not the Home Rule Movement.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Indian freedom struggle, linking personalities to specific events and movements. The distractors involve closely related figures and events, requiring precise knowledge to avoid errors.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Community                         State
1.  Dhangars                          :   Rajasthan
2.  Chenchus                           :   Odisha
3.  Kutia Kondh                       :   Maharashtra

(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Bru community is primarily located in Tripura.  The other options are incorrect. Dhangars are primarily found in Maharashtra. Chenchus are found in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Kutia Kondh are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) primarily located in Odisha. This question tests knowledge of different tribal communities and their geographical distribution.  The distractors utilize similar-sounding names of communities and states to increase the difficulty level.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Tamil and Kannada were granted classical language status in 2004. The other pairs are incorrect. Telugu received classical language status in 2008, and Malayalam in 2010. This question tests knowledge about the classical languages of India and the years in which they received this recognition.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the years, making simple guessing difficult.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of India's linguistic diversity.


**10. With reference to Gallantry Awards in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Award                            Description
1.  Ashoka Chakra                   :   Peacetime gallantry award

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest military decoration awarded for valour.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Ashoka Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award. The Kirti Chakra is a peacetime gallantry award.  The Shaurya Chakra is also a peacetime gallantry award. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's gallantry awards and their specific criteria.  The distractors skillfully interchange descriptions of different awards to test the candidate's precise understanding. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the Indian military award system.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

  Famous Place                     River
1.  Varanasi                         :   Godavari
2.  Madurai                          :   Cauvery
3.  Hampi                            :   Krishna
4.  Mysore                           :   Kabini

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Kabini River flows near Mysore. The other pairs are incorrect.  Varanasi is situated on the Ganges. Madurai is on the Vaigai. Hampi is on the Tungabhadra. This question tests the knowledge of Indian geography, linking famous places to the rivers they are situated near. The distractors involve rivers that flow in the same region, testing precise geographical knowledge.  The question assesses factual recall and application of geographical knowledge.


**12. With reference to the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Language                          Year of Inclusion
1.  Sindhi                            :   1967
2.  Konkani                           :   1992
3.  Manipuri                          :   2003

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Konkani, Manipuri, and Nepali were added to the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution through the 71st Amendment Act of 1992 and the 92nd Amendment Act of 2003.  Pair 1 is incorrect; Sindhi was added in 1967. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Eighth Schedule and the evolution of language recognition in the Indian Constitution.  The distractors involve different years of inclusion, testing precise knowledge of constitutional amendments. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of India's linguistic diversity as enshrined in the Constitution.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                             Role/Association
1.  Varahagiri Venkata Giri           :   First President elected as an independent candidate
2.  Neelam Sanjiva Reddy             :   Recipient of Bharat Ratna
3.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad               :   First President of India

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Varahagiri Venkata Giri was the first President elected as an independent candidate, and Dr. Rajendra Prasad was India's first President. The other pairs are incorrect. Neelam Sanjiva Reddy was not a recipient of the Bharat Ratna. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was the 11th President of India, not the second. This question tests knowledge of Indian Presidents and their backgrounds. The distractors involve other prominent Indian figures, demanding precise knowledge of presidential history.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of Indian political history.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                 Location
1.  Do or Die call                      :   Gwalior Tank Maidan
2.  Salt Satyagraha                    :   Dandi
3.  Quit India Movement                 :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Mahatma Gandhi issued the "Do or Die" call during the Quit India Movement, which was not solely located at Gwalior Tank Maidan.  The Salt Satyagraha started at Dandi.  The Quit India Movement was a nationwide movement. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre took place in Amritsar.  This question tests knowledge of significant events in Indian history and their locations.  The distractors cleverly mix up events and locations to test precise knowledge of historical events.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the Indian freedom struggle.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                                    Organization/Group
1.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak                    :    Ghadar Party
2.  Bipin Chandra Pal                      :    Garam Dal
3.  Lala Lajpat Rai                         :    Home Rule League

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Bipin Chandra Pal was associated with the Garam Dal (extremist faction within the Indian National Congress), and Annie Besant was a prominent member of the Theosophical Society.  The other pairs are incorrect. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was not directly associated with the Ghadar Party. Lala Lajpat Rai was associated with the Home Rule Movement but not the Home Rule League itself. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of prominent figures in the Indian National Congress and their associations with different groups and movements.  Distractors include similar-sounding organizations or figures, demanding precise knowledge of political affiliations during the freedom struggle. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of Indian political history.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Leader            Significant Movement/Event
1. Mahatma Gandhi           :    Kakori Train Action
2. Mahatma Gandhi           :    Quit India Movement
3. Alluri Sitarama Raju      :    Non-Cooperation Movement
4. Subhas Chandra Bose     :    Quit India Movement
5. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel :    Quit India Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Quit India Movement (1942) was a pivotal moment in India's struggle for independence, directly initiated by Mahatma Gandhi.  Subhas Chandra Bose, though having different approaches to the struggle, was also a key contemporary leader and his activities significantly impacted the movement's overall impact. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a crucial role in mobilizing support and coordinating activities during the Quit India Movement across various regions.

Option (a) is incorrect because while the Quit India Movement is correctly linked to Gandhi and Bose, the Kakori Train Action (1925) predates Gandhi's involvement in mass movements at a national level and was orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association.

Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Mahatma Gandhi with the Kakori Train Action.  The Kakori Train robbery was a significant event in the early stages of the Indian independence movement, but it wasn't directly connected to Gandhi's leadership or strategy.

Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes Alluri Sitarama Raju with the Non-Cooperation Movement. While Alluri Sitarama Raju was influenced by Gandhi's ideals, his major contribution, the Rampa Rebellion, occurred later and was distinctly a regional, albeit significant, armed rebellion. The linking of Sardar Patel to the Non-Cooperation movement is also inaccurate. His major role was in the later phases of the freedom struggle.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Dance Form                 State of Origin
1. Bharatanatyam             :    Andhra Pradesh
2. Kuchipudi                 :    Kerala
3. Odissi                     :    Tamil Nadu
4. Kathakali                 :    Odisha
5. Gotipua                   :    West Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

All the pairings are incorrect. Bharatanatyam originated in Tamil Nadu, Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh, Odissi in Odisha, and Kathakali in Kerala. Gotipua is a traditional dance form of Odisha, not West Bengal.  These are well-established facts within the study of Indian classical and folk dance forms.  The incorrect pairings highlight the importance of precise knowledge of the origins of different art forms.  Any option suggesting a correct match is inherently flawed.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Award Received
1. Pingali Venkayya            :    Bharat Ratna
2. V.V. Giri                  :    Padma Vibhushan
3. Kazi Nazrul Islam          :    Padma Bhushan
4. Rabindranath Tagore       :    Nobel Prize in Literature
5. Raja Ravi Varma            :    Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

V.V. Giri received the Padma Vibhushan, Kazi Nazrul Islam received the Padma Bhushan, Rabindranath Tagore won the Nobel Prize in Literature, and Raja Ravi Varma received the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal.  These are all verifiable facts regarding the awards received by these prominent individuals.  Pingali Venkayya, the designer of the Indian National Flag, is not a recipient of the Bharat Ratna.  The inclusion of this incorrect pairing serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of awards and recipients.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrect pairing of Pingali Venkayya with the Bharat Ratna.


**4. With reference to the Indian Freedom Struggle, consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary                Associated Organization/Event
1. Khudiram Bose              :    Gadar Movement
2. Ram Prasad Bismil          :    Kakori Conspiracy
3. Alluri Sitarama Raju       :    Rampa Rebellion
4. Bhagat Singh                :    Chittagong Armoury Raid

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Ram Prasad Bismil was a key figure in the Kakori Conspiracy, a significant armed revolutionary act.  Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion, a tribal uprising against British rule.  These are well-documented facts about the individuals and events.  Khudiram Bose was associated with the Anushilan Samiti, not the Gadar Movement, which was a separate and distinct movement primarily based in Punjab. Bhagat Singh was involved in the Lahore Conspiracy Case, not the Chittagong Armoury Raid, which was orchestrated by Surya Sen. The incorrect pairings test the candidate's understanding of the distinct revolutionary groups and their actions. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Birthplace
1. Rabindranath Tagore        :   Kolkata
2. Pingali Venkayya           :   Bhatlapenumarru
3. V.V. Giri                   :   Berhampur
4. Alluri Sitarama Raju       :   Mogallu
5. Khudiram Bose              :   Midnapore

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pingali Venkayya was born in Bhatlapenumarru, V.V. Giri in Berhampur, and Alluri Sitarama Raju in Mogallu. These are established facts about their birthplaces.  Rabindranath Tagore's birthplace was Jorasanko, Kolkata, not simply Kolkata. Khudiram Bose was born in a village near Midnapore, not in Midnapore itself.  The inclusion of these slightly inaccurate or incomplete details makes this question challenging and tests the candidate's precise knowledge. Options (b), (c), and (d) are inaccurate because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. With reference to Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   President                  Year of Presidency
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji          :   1906
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale     :   1905
3.  Subhas Chandra Bose     :   1938
4.  Jawaharlal Nehru         :   1936
5.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel:    1929

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Subhas Chandra Bose served as the President of the Indian National Congress in 1938. This is a well-established fact.  The other pairings are incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji's presidency was in 1906, but Gopal Krishna Gokhale's was not in 1905. Jawaharlal Nehru's presidency was in 1929 and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's presidency was in 1929.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect years tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the Indian National Congress's leadership.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one wrong pairing.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Anthem           Composer
1. Jana Gana Mana           :    Bankim Chandra Chatterjee
2. Amar Sonar Bangla         :    Rabindranath Tagore
3. Vande Mataram             :    Rabindranath Tagore
4. Sare Jahan Se Achchha    :    Mohammad Iqbal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Jana Gana Mana was composed by Rabindranath Tagore, Amar Sonar Bangla by Rabindranath Tagore, and Sare Jahan Se Achchha by Mohammad Iqbal. Vande Mataram was written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.  The incorrect pairing of Vande Mataram with Rabindranath Tagore serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's accurate knowledge of national anthems and their composers.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they include at least one mismatched pair.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reformer             Key Idea/Movement
1.  Sri Narayana Guru          :    Self-Respect Movement
2.  Ayyankali                  :    Vaikkom Satyagraha
3.  E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker    :    One Caste, One Religion, One God
4.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar         :   Temple Entry Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Ayyankali was a key figure in the Vaikkom Satyagraha, a movement fighting for the right of Dalits to use public roads. This is a well-established fact. The other pairings are incorrect.  Sri Narayana Guru championed the idea of "One Caste, One Religion, One God," not the Self-Respect Movement, which was led by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker.  E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker did not focus on the idea of "One Caste, One Religion, One God". Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, although a significant figure in the fight for Dalit rights, wasn't the leader of the Temple Entry Movement.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's specific knowledge of social reform movements and their leaders. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Freedom Fighter           Significant Action/Contribution
1.  Madame Bhikaji Cama      :   Hoisting of the Indian flag in London
2.  Rani Lakshmibai           :   Revolt of 1857
3.  Mangal Pandey            :   Sepoy Mutiny of 1857
4.  Alluri Sitarama Raju      :   Rampa Rebellion
5.  Birsa Munda               :    Ulgulan Movement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Rani Lakshmibai's participation in the 1857 Revolt, Mangal Pandey's role in initiating the Sepoy Mutiny, Alluri Sitarama Raju's leadership of the Rampa Rebellion, and Birsa Munda's Ulgulan Movement are all well-documented historical events.  Madame Bhikaji Cama is famous for hoisting an early version of the Indian flag at an international conference in Stuttgart, Germany, not in London.  The incorrect pairing of Cama with London serves as a crucial distractor to evaluate the candidate's knowledge of specific events.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the mismatched pair.



**10. With reference to  Indian Classical Dance forms, consider the following pairs:**

   Dance Form              Associated State
1.  Bharatanatyam           :   Andhra Pradesh
2.  Odissi                   :   Tamil Nadu
3.  Kuchipudi                :    Odisha
4.  Kathakali                 :   Kerala
5.  Gotipua                  :   West Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Kathakali is indeed associated with Kerala.  The other pairings are incorrect. Bharatanatyam is primarily associated with Tamil Nadu, Odissi with Odisha, and Kuchipudi with Andhra Pradesh. Gotipua is a traditional dance form of Odisha, not West Bengal.  This question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the geographical association of Indian classical dance forms.  The incorrect pairings are carefully chosen to create plausible distractors. Options (b), (c), and (d) are all incorrect because they contain at least one wrong association.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Location                      Associated Feature
1. Hampi                         :  Located on the banks of the Malaprabha River
2.  Varanasi                      :  Reduced levels of PM2.5 and PM10
3.  Madurai                       :  Located in South India
4.  Amritsar                      :  Birthplace of Madan Lal Dhingra
5.  Pune                          :  Location of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because statements 2, 3, and 5 are factually accurate.  Varanasi has seen a reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 levels due to various pollution abatement initiatives. Madurai is indeed located in South India, and Pune is home to the prestigious Film and Television Institute of India (FTII).

Option (a) is incorrect because Hampi is situated on the Tungabhadra River, not the Malaprabha River.  The Malaprabha River flows through a different region of Karnataka.

Option (b) is incorrect because while Varanasi's air quality has improved, Amritsar's association with Madan Lal Dhingra's birth is incorrect; he was born in Amritsar, but this is not the defining feature of the city for this context.

Option (c) is incorrect because  Madurai's location in South India is correct, but the assertion that Amritsar is Madan Lal Dhingra's birthplace is false; while he was from Amritsar, it's not his primary association.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Historical Figure          Significant Association
1.  Sri Aurobindo             : Authored "The Arctic Home in the Vedas"
2.  Lokmanya Tilak            :  Imprisoned in Mandalay Jail
3.  Rajiv Gandhi               :  Posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna
4.  Madan Lal Dhingra         :  Associated with Veer Savarkar
5.  Shivaram Hari Rajguru     :  Member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Rajiv Gandhi was indeed posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna. Madan Lal Dhingra's association with Veer Savarkar is well-documented, as they were both involved in revolutionary activities in Britain. Shivaram Hari Rajguru was a prominent member of the HSRA.

Option (b) is partially correct, but the statement about Lokmanya Tilak being imprisoned in Mandalay Jail is incorrect; he was imprisoned in various locations in India, but not Mandalay.

Option (a) is incorrect. Sri Aurobindo did not author "The Arctic Home in the Vedas"; that work is attributed to Lokmanya Tilak.

Option (d) is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, the statement about Lokmanya Tilak's imprisonment in Mandalay is inaccurate.


**3.  With reference to India's classical languages, consider the following pairs:**

    Language                      Year Declared Classical
1.  Tamil                         : 2005
2.  Sanskrit                      : 2004
3.  Kannada                       : 2008
4.  Malayalam                    : 2013

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  Kannada (2008), Malayalam (2013), and Odia (2014) are correctly matched with their years of being declared classical languages.

Option (b) is partially correct, but the years for Tamil and Sanskrit are incorrect.

Option (a) is incorrect; the year for Tamil is incorrect.

Option (d) is incorrect; the year for Tamil is incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                      Significant Tribal Group
1. Maharashtra                 :  Bru Tribe
2. Gujarat                      :  Warli Tribe
3. Andhra Pradesh              :  Kutia Kondh Tribe
4. Odisha                       :  Koya Tribe
5. Tripura                      :  Chenchu Tribe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. The Kutia Kondh tribe is primarily associated with Odisha.  The other pairings are incorrect:  The Warli tribe is from Maharashtra, the Bru tribe from Tripura and Mizoram, and the Chenchu tribe is primarily found in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The Koya Tribe is predominantly in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha.


**5. With reference to the  Bharat Ratna, consider the following pairs:**

    Recipient                     Field of Achievement
1.  Rajiv Gandhi                 : Politics
2.  Mother Teresa                : Social Service
3.  M.S. Swaminathan            : Science
4.  Sachin Tendulkar             : Sports

(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is the correct answer. Rajiv Gandhi, Mother Teresa, M.S. Swaminathan, and Sachin Tendulkar are all Bharat Ratna recipients, and their fields of achievement are correctly identified. C. Rajagopalachari's primary field was Politics, not Literature; though he did contribute to literature.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge of the subjects.  They utilize plausible distractors to test the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information and arrive at the correct answer based on precise factual recall.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in India.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   	Financial Institution                  Regulatory Body
    1. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)       :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
    2. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) :   Ministry of Finance
    3. Cooperative Banks                    :   National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)
    4.  Scheduled Commercial Banks       :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), with NABARD playing a supervisory role.  Scheduled Commercial Banks also fall under the regulatory purview of the RBI.  NABARD, while a crucial institution in rural finance, is itself ultimately under the Ministry of Finance. Cooperative Banks, however, are regulated and supervised by NABARD. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect because NABARD's regulatory authority lies with the Ministry of Finance.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body/Organization        Role related to RRBs
    1.  Ministry of Finance               :   Major shareholder in RRBs
    2.  State Governments                :   Regulator of RRBs
    3.  Government of India               :   Shareholder in RRBs
    4. Sponsor Banks                     :  Supervisory body for RRBs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Finance plays a significant role in the establishment and functioning of RRBs, including being a major shareholder. The Government of India, as the central authority, is also a significant shareholder. State Governments are shareholders but not regulators; the RBI is the primary regulator. Sponsor banks are shareholders but not the supervisory body; that role is primarily with NABARD and the RBI.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the roles of the named entities in relation to RRBs.


**3. With reference to the establishment of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Committee/Working Group             Recommendation
    1. Narasimham Working Group (1975)   :   Recommended the establishment of RRBs
    2.  Vyas Committee (2001)             :   Recommended the consolidation of RRBs
    3.  Dr. Vyas Committee (2001)         :   Recommended the privatization of RRBs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Narasimham Working Group (1975) is correctly linked to the recommendation for establishing RRBs, a key step in expanding rural credit access.  The Vyas Committee (2001) did indeed recommend the consolidation of RRBs, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce overlap in their operations. The statement about privatization is incorrect; the Vyas committee did not recommend privatization.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Legislation                       Provision related to RRBs
    1.  Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976    :   Established RRBs
    2.  NABARD Act, 1981                 :   Established NABARD
    3.  Banking Regulation Act, 1949      :   Provides regulatory framework for RRBs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976, is the foundational legislation establishing RRBs in India. The NABARD Act, 1981, established NABARD, the institution responsible for supervising RRBs.  The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, while not exclusively focused on RRBs, provides a significant part of the overall regulatory framework within which RRBs operate.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  The RBI's regulations further augment the legal framework.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in India:**

    1. RRBs are jointly owned by the Central Government, State Governments, and Sponsor Banks.
    2. NABARD regulates RRBs, and the RBI supervises them.
    3. The primary objective of RRBs is to provide credit to the agricultural sector and rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct as RRBs have a tripartite ownership structure. Statement 2 is incorrect because NABARD primarily supervises RRBs, while the RBI is the main regulator.  Statement 3 is correct; RRBs were primarily established to serve the credit needs of agriculture and rural areas.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                 |  Significant Feature
   ----------------------|-----------------------
   1. Karnataka          |  75 Legislative Council seats
   2. Tamil Nadu         |  57.6% landslide susceptible area
   3. Punjab              | 10.7% of India's sugarcane production
   4. Andhra Pradesh    | 80 Asian elephant population in 2019
   5. Rajasthan          | 16,655 sq km forest cover

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only pairs 3 and 5 represent accurately matched facts. Punjab contributes 10.7% to India's sugarcane production, and Rajasthan has a forest cover of 16,655 sq km.  Let's analyze the other options:

* **Pair 1:** Karnataka's Legislative Council has 75 seats, not the 18 mentioned in the distractor.
* **Pair 2:**  The distractor provides an incorrect percentage of landslide-susceptible area for Tamil Nadu.  The actual figure is different according to the source.
* **Pair 4:** The distractor gives an inaccurate figure for the Asian elephant population in Tamil Nadu in 2019. The correct figure is different.

The other options are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair.  The question tests the ability to identify precise numerical data and link it accurately to the correct state.  This requires careful evaluation and factual recall.



**2. With reference to India's agricultural landscape, consider the following pairs:**

   State          |  Major Agricultural Product
   -----------------|--------------------------
   1. Karnataka     |  Rubber
   2. Tamil Nadu    |  Millets
   3. Punjab         |  Groundnut
   4. Andhra Pradesh|  Small Cardamom
   5. Rajasthan     |  Tea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are correctly paired with their major agricultural products. Karnataka is a major producer of rubber, and Andhra Pradesh is a significant producer of small cardamom. The other options contain incorrect pairings:

* **Pair 2:** Tamil Nadu is not a major producer of millets, although it does produce them.  The distractor manipulates this fact to create a plausible but incorrect option.
* **Pair 3:** Punjab is known for wheat, rice, and other crops but not groundnut.
* **Pair 5:** Rajasthan is predominantly known for arid-climate crops; tea is not a major product of Rajasthan.


The question tests the examinee's knowledge of regional agricultural specializations and their ability to differentiate between major and minor agricultural products within each state.  The distractors are designed to test deeper understanding beyond superficial knowledge.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   State            |  Mineral Resource
   -------------------|----------------------
   1. Karnataka       |  Magnetite
   2. Tamil Nadu      |  Bauxite
   3. Punjab           |  Dolomite
   4. Andhra Pradesh  |  Chromite
   5. Rajasthan        |  Limestone

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are correctly paired with their significant mineral resources. Karnataka has magnetite reserves, and Andhra Pradesh has chromite deposits. Rajasthan also has significant limestone deposits.  The incorrect pairings are:

* **Pair 3:** Punjab is not known for significant dolomite reserves.
* **Pair 4:**  While Andhra Pradesh has some chromite, the distractor uses this to confuse the candidate. The most significant mineral resource in Andhra Pradesh is different.


The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the geographical distribution of mineral resources across different states in India.  The distractors test the ability to recall and evaluate the relative importance of different mineral resources in each state.



**4. With reference to India's power sector, consider the following pairs:**

   State             |   Scheme/Initiative
   --------------------|----------------------
   1. Karnataka        |  Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS)
   2. Andhra Pradesh   |  State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI)
   3. Punjab            |  Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme
   4. Rajasthan        |  Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA)
   5. Odisha           |  Green Fuels Alliance India (GFAI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only Karnataka and Punjab are correctly linked to the schemes. Karnataka actively participates in the RDSS, and Punjab is involved in the PAT scheme.  The distractors are designed to be plausible but incorrect:

* **Pair 2:**  Andhra Pradesh participated in the SEEI, but the distractor uses a misleading correlation.
* **Pair 4:** UJALA is a national scheme; the distractor uses a national scheme to create a plausible distractor for Rajasthan.
* **Pair 5:** GFAI is a bilateral initiative between India and Denmark, not specifically linked to Odisha.


The question tests the candidate's understanding of various power sector schemes and initiatives at the state level, requiring knowledge beyond broad awareness.  The distractors use plausible but incorrect associations to challenge the candidate's understanding.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

   State           |   Key Finding of Indian Landslide Susceptibility Map (ILSM)
   ------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
   1. Sikkim         | Highest absolute area susceptible to landslides
   2. Arunachal Pradesh | Highest percentage of land area susceptible to landslides
   3. Kerala          | Highest landslide susceptibility among non-Himalayan states
   4. Tamil Nadu     | 13.17% of geographical area susceptible to landslides
   5. Karnataka      | 4.75% of geographical area categorized as "very highly susceptible"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Arunachal Pradesh has the highest absolute area susceptible to landslides, and Kerala shows the highest landslide susceptibility amongst non-Himalayan regions.  The distractors create plausible but inaccurate pairings:

* **Pair 1:** Sikkim does not have the highest absolute area susceptible to landslides, according to the source.
* **Pair 4:** The percentage of India's geographical area susceptible to landslides (13.17%) is not specific to Tamil Nadu.
* **Pair 5:**  The 4.75% figure represents the area categorized as "very highly susceptible," not specific to Karnataka.


This question tests the ability to analyze and interpret data from a geographical report, specifically regarding landslide susceptibility.  The distractors leverage similar but incorrect data points to increase the question's difficulty level.  Accurate recall and analytical skills are needed to answer correctly.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                   Key Provision/Feature
1. Advocates Act, 1961                     :   Establishes the Bar Council of India
2. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908          :   Governs the procedure for execution of decrees
3. Representation of the People Act, 1951 :   Deals with the conduct of elections to Parliament
4. Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994:  Regulates organ donation from brain-dead individuals
5. Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961:  Details the allocation of business among government departments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Advocates Act, 1961, is the primary legislation governing the legal profession in India, and it establishes the Bar Council of India (BCI) as the regulatory body.  The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, lays down the procedure for civil litigation, including the crucial aspect of executing court decrees once a judgment is passed. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, is the cornerstone of India's electoral system, defining the process for conducting elections to both the Parliament and State Legislatures. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, specifically addresses the ethical and legal aspects of organ transplantation, including the crucial provision for organ harvesting from brain-dead individuals. The Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, are instrumental in defining the administrative framework by allocating responsibilities among various government departments.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article/Section               Subject Matter
1. Article 316                               :   Appointment of UPSC members
2. Article 105                               :   Parliamentary privileges
3. Section 290 of BNSS                         : Defines Plea Bargaining
4. Article 124                               : Establishes the Supreme Court
5. Article 72                                :  Presidential pardoning power


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 316 of the Indian Constitution explicitly deals with the appointment of members of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Article 105 outlines the privileges and immunities of members of Parliament. Section 290 of the BNSS (likely referring to a specific act, the exact name needed for confirmation) defines plea bargaining. Article 124 establishes the Supreme Court of India. Article 72 of the Constitution grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense. Thus, all pairs are correctly matched.  The slight ambiguity regarding "BNSS" doesn't invalidate the overall correctness of the pairings, assuming "BNSS" refers to a valid and relevant legal framework.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Rules                                  Pertaining To
1.  Model Code of Conduct (MCC)             :   Election Commission of India
2.  Disaster Management Act, 2005           :   National Disaster Management Authority
3.  Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961: Cabinet Committees
4.  Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993     : National Human Rights Commission
5.  Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024 : Film Certification Appellate Tribunal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure free and fair elections. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, established the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) as the apex body for disaster management in India. The Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, lay down the rules for the functioning of Cabinet Committees.  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024, while related to film certification, are not directly connected to the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT).  The FCAT is established under the Cinematograph Act, 1952, and hears appeals against decisions of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they do not include all the correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is the correct answer.  The slight misdirection with the FCAT is a deliberate attempt to make the question more challenging.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept/Doctrine                       Related Supreme Court Case
1. Basic Structure Doctrine                     :  Indra Sawhney case
2. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction        :  Kesavananda Bharati case
3. Doctrine of Severability                      :  Golaknath case
4.  Basic Structure Doctrine                   : Minerva Mills case
5. Doctrine of Prospective Overruling          : Shankari Prasad case


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Basic Structure Doctrine, a cornerstone of Indian constitutional law, was established in the *Kesavananda Bharati* case (1973), not the *Indra Sawhney* case which dealt with reservations. The *Minerva Mills* case (1980) further solidified the Basic Structure Doctrine. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction is a principle of statutory interpretation, not directly linked to a single defining case like the Basic Structure Doctrine. The Doctrine of Severability, allowing parts of a law to be struck down while upholding others, has been applied in various cases but isn't solely associated with *Golaknath*. The Doctrine of Prospective Overruling, where a court changes the law for future cases, isn't specifically linked to the *Shankari Prasad* case. Therefore, only the match between the Basic Structure Doctrine and the *Minerva Mills* case (and *Kesavananda Bharati*) is completely accurate.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                            Head/Chairperson
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)   :   President of India
2. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) :   Prime Minister of India
3. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA): Union Home Minister
4. Election Commission of India (ECI)          : Chief Election Commissioner
5. Civil Services Board (CSB)                 : Cabinet Secretary


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the President appoints the UPSC Chairperson and members, the head of the UPSC is its Chairperson, not the President.  The NHRC is headed by a Chairperson, appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister.  The NDMA is headed by the Prime Minister, not the Union Home Minister.  The Election Commission of India is headed by the Chief Election Commissioner. The Civil Services Board is chaired by the Cabinet Secretary. Therefore, only the fourth and fifth pairs are correctly matched.  The deliberate inclusion of incorrect pairings related to the heads of important constitutional bodies makes this question challenging.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry/Organization                     Specific Responsibility/Function
1. Ministry of Home Affairs                 :   Oversees the functioning of the National Human Rights Commission
2. Ministry of Home Affairs                 :   Regulates the activities of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
3. Ministry of Home Affairs                 :   Implementation of the INTER-OPERABLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM (ICJS) 2.0
4. Ministry of Home Affairs                 :   Enforcement of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in India has a wide range of responsibilities, encompassing internal security, border management, and the administration of Union Territories.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) operates under the MHA's purview, receiving oversight and support.  Similarly, the MHA plays a crucial role in regulating the activities of NGOs, ensuring adherence to legal frameworks and promoting transparency.  The implementation of the INTER-OPERABLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM (ICJS) 2.0, a significant initiative aimed at modernizing the criminal justice system, falls under the MHA's jurisdiction. Finally, the MHA is the nodal ministry responsible for enforcing the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, which addresses issues of national security and terrorism.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The MHA's multifaceted role necessitates its involvement in all the areas listed.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislative Body                          Power/Function
1. Lok Sabha                               :   Sole power to initiate Money Bills
2. Rajya Sabha                              :   Power to remove the Vice-President
3. Lok Sabha                               :   Power to pass a No-Confidence Motion against the Government
4. Rajya Sabha                              :   Power to approve the Proclamation of a Financial Emergency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the powers and functions of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the two houses of the Indian Parliament.  The Lok Sabha holds the exclusive power to initiate Money Bills, reflecting its primary role in financial matters. The Rajya Sabha possesses the power to initiate the removal of the Vice-President through a resolution. The Lok Sabha can pass a No-Confidence Motion against the government, a crucial mechanism of accountability in a parliamentary democracy. Lastly, the Rajya Sabha's power to approve the Proclamation of a Financial Emergency underscores its role in extraordinary situations impacting the nation's financial stability. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.  The correct answer encompasses the distinct yet interconnected functions of both houses in the Indian legislative framework.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 :   Allows organ harvesting from brain-dead patients with family consent.
2. The Advocates Act, 1961                           :   Prescribes two classes of advocates: senior and other advocates.
3. The Foreigners Act, 1946                           :   Governs all undocumented foreign nationals in India.
4. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024           :   Notified by the Ministry of Home Affairs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each of the pairs accurately reflects a key provision or feature of the respective legislation. The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, explicitly allows organ donation from brain-dead individuals with the consent of their families, addressing ethical and legal aspects of organ transplantation. The Advocates Act, 1961, establishes a clear distinction between senior advocates and other advocates, defining the criteria for achieving senior advocate status.  The Foreigners Act, 1946, serves as the primary legal instrument governing the status and treatment of undocumented foreign nationals in India.  Finally, the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, were indeed notified by the Ministry of Home Affairs, signifying the MHA's role in immigration and citizenship matters.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incomplete and incorrect. The accurate matching of all four pairs demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the legal frameworks involved.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Programme                  Implementing Agency/Ministry
1. National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)         :   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)
2. Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP)   :   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)
3. National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC):   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)
4. India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP)              :   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), designed to improve air quality across Indian cities, is a significant initiative under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC).  The Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP), focused on creating a skilled workforce for environmental sustainability, is also implemented by the MoEF&CC. The National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), providing financial assistance for climate change adaptation projects, operates under the MoEF&CC's purview. Lastly, the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP), a comprehensive strategy for sustainable cooling, is another key programme under the MoEF&CC. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and do not represent the full extent of the MoEF&CC's role in environmental protection and sustainable development. The correct option reflects the ministry's extensive involvement in these crucial national programmes.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disaster/Event                                     Relevant International Agreement/Initiative
1. COVID-19 Pandemic                             :   International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005
2.  Global Vision Impairment and Blindness         :   SPECS 2030 Initiative
3.  Declines in Childhood Vaccination Rates      :   The Big Catch-Up Initiative
4.  Swift Detection of Infectious Disease Threats :   International Pathogen Surveillance Network (IPSN)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately link a specific disaster or global health challenge with the relevant international agreement or initiative designed to address it.  The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, a legally binding agreement aiming to prevent and manage international health emergencies. The SPECS 2030 Initiative is a WHO initiative directly focused on addressing global vision impairment and blindness.  The Big Catch-Up Initiative is a collaborative effort by various international organizations to reverse declines in childhood vaccination rates, a serious concern for global public health.  The International Pathogen Surveillance Network (IPSN), launched by WHO, is a critical tool for the swift detection and response to emerging infectious disease threats.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they fail to recognize the accurate linkages between the global health challenges and the international initiatives designed to combat them. The comprehensive matching in option (d) highlights a thorough understanding of global health governance mechanisms.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                         Characteristic/Feature
1. Chikungunya                                  :   Transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
2. Zika Virus                                    :   Associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome
3. Swine Flu Strain H1N2                         :   Caused by swine influenza viruses
4. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)                      :   Affects cattle, causing skin nodules


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly identify characteristics or features of the listed diseases. Chikungunya is indeed a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.  The Zika virus is known to be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological disorder, particularly in adults and children.  Swine flu strain H1N2 is caused by swine influenza viruses, highlighting its zoonotic nature.  Lumpy skin disease (LSD), a viral disease affecting cattle, is characterized by the development of skin nodules, leading to reduced milk yield and sometimes death. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and fail to capture the full scope of the characteristics of these diseases.  The correct option (d) demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the features of each disease.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cybersecurity Threat/Concept                     Description/Feature

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs provide accurate descriptions of the cybersecurity threats and concepts. GPS spoofing is a technique where malicious actors transmit false GPS signals, disrupting navigation and location services.  Doxxing involves the unauthorized collection and publication of an individual's private information, often with malicious intent. Mercenary spyware refers to malicious software used to secretly infiltrate and monitor devices, often targeting specific individuals for espionage or surveillance.  Shallowfakes are manipulated media (videos, images, audio) created using readily available technologies, as opposed to AI-generated deepfakes. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and fail to encompass the full set of correctly matched pairs.  Option (d) shows a comprehensive understanding of the various types of cyber threats and their characteristics.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  LeadIT Initiative                             :   Transitioning energy-intensive industries to low-carbon pathways
4.  Colombo Declaration on Sustainable Nitrogen Management :   Halving nitrogen waste by 2030


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately match the international initiatives/agreements with their respective focus areas. The National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) in India has funded projects to mitigate the impact of stubble burning. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is a joint FAO/WHO body that develops international food standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and recommendations. The LeadIT Initiative aims to guide energy-intensive industries toward the low-carbon economy. The Colombo Declaration on Sustainable Nitrogen Management focuses on reducing nitrogen waste to improve environmental sustainability. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore insufficient and incorrect, failing to include all correctly matched pairs. Option (d) comprehensively demonstrates an understanding of these international collaborations and their goals.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Mission (NAPCC)                     Goal/Objective
1. National Solar Mission                      :   Achieve 280 GW of installed solar capacity by 2030

3. National Mission on Sustainable Habitat     :   Promote urban public transport
4. National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE): Empower local communities in ecological resource management


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links a National Mission under India's National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) with its primary goal or objective. The National Solar Mission aims to significantly increase India's solar energy capacity. The National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency focuses on creating a market-driven approach to energy efficiency. The National Mission on Sustainable Habitat promotes sustainable urban development, including public transport. The National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem empowers local communities in the Himalayan region to manage ecological resources sustainably. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and fail to encompass all correctly matched pairs. Option (d) demonstrates a complete understanding of the objectives of these key national missions.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

  State                    Geographical Feature
1. Karnataka              Nilgiri Hills
2. Tamil Nadu             Agasthyamalai
3. Kerala                  Anamalai Hills
4. Maharashtra            Sahyadri Range
5. Goa                     Palghat Gap

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Nilgiri Hills are a part of the Western Ghats mountain range, located primarily in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, but also extending into Karnataka.  Agasthyamalai is a mountain range in the southern Western Ghats, spanning across Tamil Nadu and Kerala.  The Anamalai Hills are another prominent range within the Western Ghats, situated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Sahyadri Range is an alternative name for the Western Ghats, predominantly in Maharashtra.  The Palghat Gap, however, is a significant break in the Western Ghats, not specifically located in Goa, but rather forming a passage between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

  River                     Originating Location
1. Sharavati River          Western Ghats
2. Pamba River             Western Ghats
3. Periyar River            Western Ghats
4. Mahadayi River          Western Ghats
5. Cauvery River           Eastern Ghats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sharavati, Pamba, Periyar, and Mahadayi rivers all originate within the Western Ghats mountain range.  The Cauvery River, however, originates in the Brahmagiri hills of the Western Ghats, not the Eastern Ghats.  This makes option (a) the only correct choice. The inclusion of the Cauvery in option (c) and (d) acts as a significant distractor for candidates who may not know the precise origin of the river.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  State                     Western Ghats Characteristic
1. Karnataka               High rainfall
2. Tamil Nadu              Steep gradient
3. Kerala                   Thick vegetation
4. Maharashtra             Laterite soils
5. Goa                      Rocky terrain

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect characteristics of the Western Ghats within the respective states.  Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala experience high rainfall due to the orographic effect of the Ghats.  The Western Ghats are characterized by steep gradients across all these states.  Thick vegetation is a defining feature of the Western Ghats' biodiversity hotspots. Laterite soils are commonly found across the Western Ghats in Maharashtra and other states.  Finally, rocky terrain is a significant aspect of the Western Ghats' geological structure, prominently observed in Goa as well.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Geographical Location     Western Ghats Feature
1. Thiruvananthapuram       Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA)
2. Mumbai                   Magnetite reserves
3. Mahabaleshwar           UNESCO World Heritage Site
4. Agasthyamalai            Biodiversity Hotspot
5. Periyar                   Water divide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Thiruvananthapuram is a city in Kerala, which is located within the Western Ghats, a designated ESA.  Mumbai is located on the west coast of India, in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats, not directly within the region of significant Magnetite reserves. Mahabaleshwar is located within the Western Ghats, but it is not itself a UNESCO World Heritage Site (the entire Western Ghats are). Agasthyamalai, located in the southern Western Ghats, is indeed part of a major biodiversity hotspot. The Periyar River, originating in the Western Ghats, contributes to the formation of a water divide. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options present compelling distractors by including plausible but ultimately incorrect associations.


**5. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following pairs:**

  State          River Originating in the Western Ghats
1. Karnataka      Krishna River
2. Tamil Nadu     Vaigai River
3. Kerala         Bharathapuzha River
4. Maharashtra    Godavari River
5. Goa            Mahadayi River

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) Only one
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Vaigai River originates in the Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu.  The Bharathapuzha River originates in the Western Ghats of Kerala. The Mahadayi River originates in the Western Ghats in Karnataka and flows through Goa. The Krishna and Godavari rivers, while flowing through parts of the Western Ghats' influence zone, do not originate within the mountain range itself.  Their origins lie elsewhere in the Deccan Plateau. Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Protected Area               State
1. Mollem NP                  Karnataka
2. Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary  Tamil Nadu
3. Aralam WLS                  Kerala
4. Someshwara WLS             Maharashtra
5. Chimmony WLS               Goa

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) Only two
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mollem National Park is located in Goa, not Karnataka. Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary is located in Karnataka, not Tamil Nadu. Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is indeed located in Kerala. Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary is in Karnataka, not Maharashtra. Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary is in Kerala, not Goa. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other options include distractors that deliberately mix up the locations of these protected areas.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats are located in Peninsular India.
2. The Western Ghats form a continuous mountain range.
3. The Western Ghats are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Western Ghats are located along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau in Peninsular India.  Statement 2 is incorrect: The Western Ghats are not a continuous mountain range; they have gaps and breaks.  Statement 3 is correct: The Western Ghats are a designated UNESCO World Heritage site.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  State                Major Crop Cultivated in the Western Ghats
1. Karnataka           Sugarcane
2. Tamil Nadu           Coffee
3. Kerala               Tea
4. Maharashtra          Cardamom
5. Goa                  Arecanut

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Coffee is a major crop cultivated in the Western Ghats region of Tamil Nadu. Tea is a significant crop in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Sugarcane, although grown in parts of the Western Ghats' influence zone, is not a major crop specifically associated with the Western Ghats themselves in Karnataka or elsewhere. Similarly, Cardamom and Arecanut, while present in the Western Ghats, are not major crops across all the states mentioned. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options utilize plausible distractors to test the candidate's knowledge of specific agricultural practices in the Western Ghats region.


**9. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following pairs:**

  Natural Hazard           Affected State
1. Landslides              Gujarat
2. Floods                   Kerala
3. Cyclones                Karnataka
4. Cloudbursts             Maharashtra
5.  Droughts                Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) Only one
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Landslides are a significant natural hazard in the Western Ghats, but Gujarat is outside the main Western Ghats region and experiences different types of geological hazards. Floods are a frequent occurrence in the Western Ghats of Kerala due to its high rainfall. Cyclones are not a primary hazard directly associated with the Western Ghats in Karnataka; coastal areas of Karnataka might be affected by cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal. Cloudbursts are a potential hazard in the mountainous regions of the Western Ghats of Maharashtra. Droughts can affect the rain-shadow areas on the leeward side of the Western Ghats, including parts of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are designed to confuse candidates who may have a general understanding of Western Ghats hazards but lack precise knowledge of their regional distribution.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

  Committee                Focus Area
1. Western Ghats Experts Ecology Panel (WGEEP) :  Ecological Sensitivity of Western Ghats
2. Gadgil Committee           Rain Shadow effect on the Western Ghats
3. Kasturirangan Committee   Conservation of Biodiversity in Western Ghats
4. High-Level Working Group (HLWG) :   Management of Western Ghats

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Western Ghats Experts Ecology Panel (WGEEP) was indeed tasked with assessing the ecological sensitivity of the Western Ghats. The Kasturirangan Committee's report focused on conservation and ecological management within the Western Ghats. The High-Level Working Group (HLWG) also focused on the same ecological aspects. The Gadgil Committee, while related to the Western Ghats, didn't specifically focus on the rain shadow effect as its primary mandate. The rain shadow effect is a consequence of the Western Ghats' geographical location, but not the central theme of the Gadgil Committee report. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of the Gadgil Committee as a distractor in options (c) and (d) tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the specific mandates of various committees related to the Western Ghats.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Feature        Highest Peak

1. Aravalli Range             :  Mount Abu
2.  Khangsar Khola            :  Annapurna Massif
3.  Atharamura Range         :  Guru Shikhar
4.  Annapurna Massif          :  Betling Sib


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because Guru Shikhar is the highest peak in the Aravalli Range, located in Mount Abu, Rajasthan.  Option 1 incorrectly pairs the Aravalli Range with Mount Abu; while Mount Abu contains Guru Shikhar, it is not the highest peak of the entire Aravalli range. Option 2 correctly identifies Annapurna Massif as a mountain range with Khangsar Khola being one of its source rivers. The relationship is correct, though not a direct "highest peak" relationship. Option 3 incorrectly states that Guru Shikhar is the highest peak of the Atharamura range; Guru Shikhar is in the Aravalli range. Option 4 incorrectly pairs Annapurna Massif with Betling Sib; Betling Sib is the highest peak in Tripura.  The question tests factual recall of geographical features and their highest points, requiring precise knowledge beyond general awareness. Distractors are designed to be plausible based on the proximity and relatedness of the geographical locations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                      Originating Location

1. Gumti River                : Atharamura Hills, Tripura
2. Marsyangdi River           :  Annapurna Massif, Nepal
3. Trishuli River              :  Mugling, Nepal
4. Jhelum River               :  Wular Lake, Jammu and Kashmir


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a).  The Gumti River originates in the Atharamura range in Tripura, and the Marsyangdi River originates northwest of the Annapurna massif in Nepal. Option 3 is incorrect because the Trishuli River does not originate in Mugling; it's where the Marsyangdi joins it. Option 4 is incorrect; the Jhelum River does not originate in Wular Lake, but rather feeds into it. This question tests precise knowledge of river origins, demanding accurate factual recall.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect origins for well-known rivers adds to the question's difficulty.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Capital City

1. Poland                     :  Warsaw
2. Botswana                   : Gaborone
3.  Nepal                      : Kathmandu
4.  Indonesia                  : Manila
5.  Philippines                :  Praia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a). Warsaw is the capital of Poland, Gaborone is the capital of Botswana, and Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal. Option 4 is incorrect as Manila is the capital of the Philippines, not Indonesia (Jakarta). Option 5 is incorrect because Praia is the capital of Cabo Verde, not the Philippines.  The question assesses factual recall of capital cities, using plausible but incorrect pairings to increase difficulty.  The inclusion of multiple countries tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between them accurately.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sea                          Location

1. Sea of Okhotsk              : West of Kamchatka Peninsula
2. Bering Sea                  : East of Kamchatka Peninsula
3. South China Sea             : Between India and Sri Lanka
4.  Mediterranean Sea          : South of Greece
5.  Caribbean Sea              : West of Cuba


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The Sea of Okhotsk is located west of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Bering Sea is located east of it. The Mediterranean Sea is located south of Greece, and the Caribbean Sea is west of Cuba. Option 3 is incorrect because the South China Sea is not located between India and Sri Lanka; it's located off the coast of Southeast Asia. This question tests knowledge of geographical locations of seas and oceans, using a combination of correct and incorrect pairings to increase difficulty.  The question demands specific knowledge and eliminates options based on inaccurate geographical placements.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Island/Island Group       Country/Territory

1. Guam                       : United States
2. Kuril Islands              :  Russia and Japan
3. Kinmen Islands             :  Philippines
4.  Galapagos Islands         :  Ecuador
5.  Cocos (Keeling) Islands :  Indonesia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). Guam is a territory of the United States, the Kuril Islands are claimed by both Russia and Japan, and the Galapagos Islands belong to Ecuador. Option 3 is incorrect as the Kinmen Islands are under the jurisdiction of Taiwan. Option 5 is incorrect; the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are an external territory of Australia.  The question tests knowledge of island territories and their associated countries, using plausible distractors that are geographically close or historically linked.  The candidate needs to accurately distinguish between the correct pairings based on precise political and geographical knowledge.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                     River System

1. Marsyangdi River           :  Gandaki River system
2. Gumti River                :  Meghna River system
3.  Jhelum River              :  Indus River system
4.  Volta River                :  Amazon River system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The Marsyangdi River is a tributary of the Gandaki River system, the Gumti River flows into the Meghna River in Bangladesh, and the Jhelum River is part of the Indus River system.  Option 4 is incorrect because the Volta River is located in West Africa and is not part of the Amazon River system. This question assesses understanding of river systems and their tributaries, requiring accurate recall of river geography.  The inclusion of a distractor from a different continent increases the difficulty level.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lake                        Country

1. Wular Lake                 : India
2. Lake Victoria              : Africa
3. Lake Titicaca               : Bolivia and Peru
4.  Lake Chad                 : Chad
5.  Lake Maracaibo             : Brazil


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Wular Lake is the largest freshwater lake in India, Lake Titicaca is situated in both Bolivia and Peru, and Lake Chad is in Chad. Option 2 is partially correct as Lake Victoria is in Africa but it's more accurately associated with Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. Option 5 is incorrect; Lake Maracaibo is in Venezuela.  The question tests knowledge of major lakes and their locations, using partially correct and incorrect options to make it challenging.  The candidate needs to demonstrate precise knowledge of lake locations.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Dam                         River

1. Dumbar Dam                 : Gumti River
2. Arbaat Dam                 : Nile River
3.  Mullaperiyar Dam           : Periyar River
4.  Krishna Raja Sagar Dam    : Cauvery River


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). The Dumbar Dam is on the Gumti River, the Mullaperiyar Dam is on the Periyar River, and the Krishna Raja Sagar Dam is on the Cauvery River. Option 2 is incorrect; the Arbaat Dam, though located in Sudan, is not directly on the Nile River;  it's in the Atbara River basin.  This question tests factual knowledge of dams and the rivers they are built on, demanding precise information.  The inclusion of a distractor based on a dam's location but not the river it's directly on increases difficulty.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                 Significant Geographical Feature

1. Poland                  : Baltic Sea
2.  Germany                 : Black Sea
3.  Russia                   : Ural Mountains
4.  Botswana                : Kalahari Desert
5.  Indonesia               : Java Trench


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer. Poland borders the Baltic Sea, Russia includes the Ural Mountains, and Botswana is largely covered by the Kalahari Desert. Indonesia includes the Java Trench. Option 2 is incorrect because Germany does not border the Black Sea; it's located further west. This question tests knowledge of significant geographical features associated with specific countries, using plausible but incorrect features to challenge the candidate.  The ability to recall specific geographical features for each country is crucial.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Ladki Bahin Yojana focuses on girl child education, Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana promotes biofuels, the Clean Plant Programme aims to improve the horticulture sector, and the Nirbhaya Fund is used to enhance women's safety and security. This question tests knowledge of Indian government schemes and their primary objectives, requiring accurate recall of program details.  The inclusion of all correct pairings makes the question challenging as the candidate must recall all the schemes and their core aims accurately.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Ministry of Education is responsible for developing and implementing the National Credit Framework (NCrF). The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), a flagship program of the Ministry of Rural Development, focuses on rural connectivity. The Smart Cities Mission is a key initiative of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs aimed at developing urban infrastructure. The Namami Gange Programme, under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, focuses on the rejuvenation of the Ganga River. Finally, the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) is a scheme under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare which aims to improve agricultural infrastructure.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  The comprehensive nature of the correct answer (c) demonstrates a thorough understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various Indian government ministries in implementing key development schemes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Organization             Policy/Program
1. Ministry of Education                 :  Samagra Siksha Abhiyaan (hostels)
2. Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) :  State Rankings (Startups)
3. Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports     :  RESET Programme
4. Indian Army                           : Project NAMAN
5. Ministry of Finance (MOF)            : Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched. The Ministry of Education is involved in the implementation of Samagra Shiksha, which includes hostel facilities. The DPIIT manages the State Rankings for startups. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports launched the RESET Programme for retired sportspersons. The Indian Army implements Project NAMAN for Defence pensioners.  The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), a financial inclusion scheme, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect, failing to encompass the full range of accurate ministry-scheme/program relationships.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the diverse roles and responsibilities of various government organizations in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                     Implementing Ministry/Agency
1.  Jiyo Parsi Scheme                   : Ministry of Minority Affairs
2.  Mission Karmayogi                  : Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions
3.  National Quantum Mission (NQM)    : Department of Science & Technology (DST)
4.  Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) 2.0 : Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas
5.  National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG): Ministry of Jal Shakti


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Jiyo Parsi scheme, aimed at addressing the declining Parsi population, is implemented by the Ministry of Minority Affairs. Mission Karmayogi, a civil service capacity building initiative, falls under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions. The Department of Science & Technology (DST) is the lead agency for the National Quantum Mission (NQM). The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) 2.0, focused on providing LPG connections, is managed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.  Finally, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) operates under the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accurate implementation agencies for all the listed schemes and programs, underscoring the importance of detailed knowledge about government schemes in India.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the government's organizational structure and its implementation of various schemes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Program          Key Feature/Objective
1.  Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) :  Promote financial inclusion
2.  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) 2.0 : Affordable urban housing
3.  Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) :  Interest subvention on loans for post-harvest infrastructure
4.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 :  Overseen by the Ministry of Rural Development
5.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) :  Joint funding by the Union and State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) does indeed provide interest subvention on loans for post-harvest management infrastructure.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are characterized by joint funding from the Union and State governments.  The other pairs are mismatched. ONDC's primary aim is to democratize e-commerce, not financial inclusion. PMAY-U focuses on affordable housing, but the statement doesn't accurately capture its full scope. NEP 2020 is overseen by the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer, demonstrating a clear understanding of the nuances of various government schemes and their objectives.  This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between the core features of various government programs and to identify mismatched information.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                                 Recent Policy/Initiative
1.  Odisha                               :  Menstrual leave policy for working women
2.  Maharashtra                         :  New social media policy for influencers
3.  Uttar Pradesh                       :  Subhadra Scheme
4.  Gujarat                              :  PM-WANI scheme
5.  Himachal Pradesh                   : Raised the minimum age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Maharashtra recently launched a social media policy incentivizing influencers to promote state initiatives. Rajasthan launched the Subhadra scheme. Himachal Pradesh recently raised the minimum marriage age for girls. The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly attribute policies or initiatives to the wrong states. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of recent state-level policy developments in India and the ability to correctly match states with their specific initiatives.  The inclusion of plausible distractors increases the question's difficulty level.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                     Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana         :   Extension of implementation timeline to 2028-29
2. Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana:   Financial assistance to women aged 21-65
3. Jiyo Parsi Scheme                    :   Financial aid for assisted reproductive technologies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, a modified scheme focused on biofuels, indeed extends its implementation timeline by five years, until 2028-29. This extension allows for the inclusion of advanced biofuels and the participation of existing plants in the scheme.  The Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, a Maharashtra government scheme, directly transfers ₹1,500 to eligible women's bank accounts, targeting those aged 21-65 from families with an income below ₹2.5 lakh. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme, designed to address the declining Parsi population, offers financial assistance, including support for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) as a key component to help Parsi couples have children.  Therefore, each scheme's core feature accurately reflects its objective and implementation.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Organization                Scheme Implemented
1. Ministry of Culture                     :   Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana
2. Ministry of Education                  :   National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
3. Ministry of Minority Affairs            :   Jiyo Parsi Scheme

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Ministry of Education is responsible for launching and implementing the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) to rank higher education institutions in India. The Ministry of Minority Affairs launched and oversees the Jiyo Parsi Scheme, aimed at reversing the declining Parsi population.  Pair 1 is incorrect. While the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana is a government scheme, it falls under the purview of the Union Cabinet and is not directly implemented by the Ministry of Culture.  The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas plays a significant role in its implementation.  Therefore, option (c) is the only accurate response.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Program                     Target Beneficiary Group
1. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U):   Middle-income group families only
2. Mission Karmayogi                      :   All civil servants across various departments
3. Ladki Bahin Yojana                      :    Women aged 21-65 from low-income families

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Mission Karmayogi, a national program for civil services capacity building, targets all civil servants, aiming to enhance their skills and efficiency.  The Ladki Bahin Yojana, a Maharashtra government initiative, specifically targets women aged 21-65 from low-income families to provide them with financial assistance.  However, pair 1 is incorrect. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) is not exclusively for middle-income group families; it also includes Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Low Income Group (LIG) families who do not own a pucca house.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                                    Policy Implemented
1. Maharashtra                             :   Menstrual leave policy
2. Odisha                                  :   Menstrual leave policy
3. Kerala                                 :    Menstrual leave policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Odisha and Kerala have both implemented a one-day menstrual leave policy for working women.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  However, pair 1 is incorrect; while Maharashtra has schemes supporting women, it's not explicitly mentioned to have a dedicated menstrual leave policy as of the provided information.  Therefore, option (b) is the only correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Art Form                                 Associated State/Region
1. Kalamkari                               :   Telangana
2. Tanjore Paintings                       :   Tamil Nadu
3. Cheriyal Painting                        :   Andhra Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tanjore paintings are prominently associated with Tamil Nadu, and Cheriyal painting is a traditional art form of Telangana.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correct.  However, Kalamkari is primarily associated with Andhra Pradesh, not Telangana. This makes option 1 incorrect.  Option (c) is the only one that correctly identifies the accurate pairings.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry                                  Associated Scheme
1. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas   :   Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana
2. Ministry of Culture                      :   Project PARI
3. Ministry of Education                    :   Mission Karmayogi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas plays a significant role in the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana.  The Ministry of Culture launched Project PARI.  However, pair 3 is incorrect. While Mission Karmayogi falls under the ambit of the government, it is primarily driven by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, not the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education is involved in training components of the scheme but not the primary implementing ministry.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Implementing Agency                  Government Scheme
1.  National Health Authority (NHA)       :   Mission Karmayogi
2.  Lalit Kala Akademi & NGMA           :   Project PARI
3.  Centre for High Technology (CHT)      :   Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) jointly manage Project PARI.  The Centre for High Technology (CHT), under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, is the implementing agency for the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana.  However, pair 1 is incorrect. The National Health Authority (NHA) is the implementing agency for the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and related health schemes, not Mission Karmayogi.  Mission Karmayogi's implementation involves the Department of Personnel and Training and other bodies.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                 Focus Area
1. Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana          :   Horticulture
2.  National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG):   River rejuvenation
3.  RISE Accelerator Program              :   Start-ups and MSMEs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) is focused on the rejuvenation of the Ganga river. The RISE Accelerator program specifically supports start-ups and MSMEs in expanding their operations between India and Australia.  However, the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana focuses on biofuels, not horticulture.  The scheme aims to utilize agricultural residues and other materials to produce biofuels, contributing to energy security. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                                  Key Policy Feature
1. Bihar                                  :   One-day Menstrual Leave
2. Odisha                                 :   One-day Menstrual Leave
3. Kerala                                :   One-day Menstrual Leave

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Odisha and Kerala have implemented one-day menstrual leave policies.  Bihar also has a menstrual leave policy. However,  the provided text only explicitly mentions Odisha and Kerala as having implemented such policies.  While Bihar might also have a similar policy, the provided information only confirms the policies for Odisha and Kerala.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are definitively confirmed as correct, making option (b) the appropriate answer.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to avoid assumptions based on incomplete information.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Central Sector Scheme                  Primary Objective
1. Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme        :   Financial assistance for higher education
2. Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme       :   Financial assistance for secondary education
3. Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship    :   Financial assistance for professional courses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship is specifically designed to support students pursuing professional and technical courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme focuses on financial assistance for students in classes IX and X (secondary education), not higher education.  Pair 2 is also incorrect; the Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme covers education from class XI onwards, including professional courses, but it doesn't primarily focus on secondary education.  The question highlights the importance of careful reading and understanding the nuances of government schemes.  Option (b) is the only correct answer because it accurately reflects the primary objective of only one scheme.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Activity/Responsibility
1. National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) :  Registered under the Indian Trusts Act
2. National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA): Headed by the Prime Minister
3.  cGanga (Centre for Ganga River Basin Management and Studies) : Implements the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP)
4. Ministry of Jal Shakti                      : Develops Urban River Management Plans (URMPs)
5. Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) : Manages the River Ganga


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) is registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, not the Indian Trusts Act.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) was indeed chaired by the Prime Minister.  Pair 2 is thus correct. cGanga acts as a think tank for NMCG and doesn't directly implement the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP); that responsibility lies primarily with the NMCG. Hence, pair 3 is incorrect.  The Ministry of Jal Shakti plays a crucial role in river management, including aspects of the National River Conservation Plan, but the development of URMPs is a collaborative effort involving multiple agencies, including NIUA and NMCG, not solely the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  Finally, the DPIIT is not involved in the direct management of the River Ganga; this falls under the purview of the Ministry of Jal Shakti and related organizations like NMCG.  Pair 5 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                           Key Feature/Objective
1.  Namami Gange Mission                     : Focuses solely on the main stem of the Ganga River
2.  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) : Provides financial assistance to all landholding farmers
3.  Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY)   : Incentivizes job creation in the informal sector
4.  Assistance to Medical Device Clusters for Common Facilities (AMD-CF) : Aims to boost medical device manufacturing
5.  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)  : Uses weather parameters as the sole basis for crop loss compensation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Namami Gange Mission takes a holistic approach, encompassing the main stem and tributaries of the Ganga River.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  While PM-KISAN does aim to supplement the financial needs of landholding farmers, there are certain exclusions and eligibility criteria. Thus, pair 2 is not entirely accurate. ABRY incentivizes job creation in the *formal* sector, not the informal sector. Pair 3 is incorrect. The AMD-CF scheme accurately aims to strengthen medical device clusters and boost manufacturing.  Pair 4 is correct.  PMFBY uses weather parameters as a *proxy* for crop yields in some cases (RWBCIS), but not as the *sole* basis for compensation; yield losses are also considered. Pair 5 is incorrect. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Ministry                        Associated Scheme/Program
1. Ministry of Railways                        : Kochi Water Metro
2. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs      : Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS)
3.  Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) :  National Common Mobility Card (NCMC)
4. Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways :  Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC)
5.  State Bank of India (SBI)                  :  PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kochi Water Metro is an initiative under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, not the Ministry of Railways. Pair 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is indeed the administrative body overseeing the RRTS project through the NCRTC. Pair 2 is correct. DFCCIL is responsible for Dedicated Freight Corridors, not the NCMC.  The NCMC is a collaborative project involving the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, NPCI, C-DAC, and BEL. Pair 3 is incorrect. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways is correctly linked to the EDFC's development and implementation. Pair 4 is correct. SBI launched an NCMC RuPay prepaid card, but it's not directly associated with the PM Gati Shakti Master Plan; the plan involves multiple ministries and infrastructure projects. Pair 5 is incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Program/Initiative             Implementing Agency/Ministry
1.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II :  Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
2.  PMJDY                                     : Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3.  Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)    :  NABARD
4.  Project NAMAN                             :  Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports
5.  Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047          : Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II falls under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, not the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. Pair 1 is incorrect.  The RBI plays a significant regulatory role in PMJDY, but the scheme's implementation involves multiple banks and agencies. Pair 2 is not fully accurate. NABARD is indeed a key player in the AIF's implementation, providing credit guarantees and support. Pair 3 is correct. Project NAMAN is an Indian Army initiative, not under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports. Pair 4 is incorrect. The Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 is an initiative of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, not the EPFO. Pair 5 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  While the RBI is involved in regulating PMJDY, NABARD's role in AIF is more direct and central to its implementation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                                     Significant Scheme/Initiative Implemented
1. Odisha                                    :  Lakhpati Didi Yojana
2. Uttar Pradesh                             : Subhadra Scheme
3. Himachal Pradesh                          :  Social Media Policy offering payments to influencers
4. Maharashtra                               : Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2024
5. Gujarat                                   :  Implementation of the RESET Programme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lakhpati Didi Yojana was launched in Maharashtra, not Odisha. Pair 1 is incorrect. The Subhadra scheme was announced in Odisha, not Uttar Pradesh. Pair 2 is incorrect. Uttar Pradesh implemented a social media policy with payments to influencers, not Himachal Pradesh. Pair 3 is correct. Himachal Pradesh passed the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2024, not Maharashtra. Pair 4 is incorrect.  The RESET Programme is a national-level initiative, not specifically implemented in Gujarat. Pair 5 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other pairs incorrectly associate the schemes with different states.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Australia's relationships and characteristics.  Each question adheres to the specified format and criteria, aiming for a difficult level.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country          Economic Relationship with Australia
1. India           : Major importer of Australian coal
2. China           : Significant recipient of Australian iron ore exports
3. Japan           : Leading importer of Australian wheat
4. United Kingdom : Primary exporter of wool to Australia
5. United States   : Major partner in AUKUS security pact

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India is indeed a major importer of Australian coal, a significant component of Australia's export economy.  China's reliance on Australian iron ore for its steel industry is also well-documented. The AUKUS pact, involving Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, represents a significant strategic security partnership.  However, options 3 and 4 are incorrect. While Japan imports agricultural products from Australia, wheat isn't its leading import from Australia.  Australia is a major wool producer and exporter, but the UK is not its primary importer of wool; China is a major importer of Australian wool.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Australia's geopolitical relations, consider the following pairs:**

Country        Type of Agreement/Partnership
1. Indonesia     :  Bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
2. New Zealand  :  Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement
3. India          :  Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA)
4. United States :  AUKUS security alliance
5. Japan         :  Security Dialogue Partnership

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Australia and New Zealand share a close relationship, epitomized by the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement facilitating ease of movement between the two countries. The AUKUS security alliance is a key strategic partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, focused on defense and security cooperation.  Australia and Japan have a security dialogue partnership, but it doesn't reach the level of a formal security alliance as AUKUS.  Options 1 and 3 are incorrect. While Australia has FTAs with many countries, it does not have a specific bilateral FTA with Indonesia. While Australia and India have enhanced their economic cooperation, it is not framed as a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in the same way that some other agreements are.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the nature of Australia's relationships.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Geographical Feature       Characteristic/Association
1. Great Barrier Reef       :  Largest coral reef system globally
2. Uluru (Ayers Rock)      :  Located in the Northern Territory
3. Murray-Darling Basin    :  Australia's largest river system
4. Great Victoria Desert    :  Part of the arid zone of Western Australia
5. Tasmania               :  Island state, separated from mainland by Bass Strait


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Great Barrier Reef is indeed the world's largest coral reef system.  The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's largest river system, vital for agriculture and the environment. Tasmania is an island state separated from the mainland by Bass Strait. However, options 2 and 4 are incorrect.  Uluru (Ayers Rock) is located in the central region of Australia, not the Northern Territory. The Great Victoria Desert is a significant desert, but it's not exclusively or primarily located in Western Australia; it spans several states. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are accurately matched.


**4. With reference to Australia's natural resources and industries, consider the following pairs:**

Resource/Industry         Key Location/Characteristic
1. Coal Mining              :  Predominantly located in Queensland and New South Wales
2. Iron Ore Production      :  Centered in the Pilbara region of Western Australia
3. Gold Mining              :  Significant deposits in Victoria and Western Australia
4. Bauxite Mining           :  Major deposits in the Northern Territory and Western Australia
5. Wheat Farming            :  Primarily concentrated in the eastern coastal regions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Coal mining in Australia is indeed concentrated in Queensland and New South Wales.  Iron ore production is heavily centered in Western Australia's Pilbara region. Gold mining has significant operations in both Victoria and Western Australia.  Bauxite mining, a key step in aluminum production, does have major deposits in both the Northern Territory and Western Australia. However, option 5 is incorrect. While wheat farming is significant in Australia, it's not primarily concentrated in the eastern coastal regions; it's spread across various regions suitable for agriculture, including inland areas. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

International Organization/Agreement   Australian Involvement
1. G20                         :   Full Member
2. ASEAN Regional Forum          :   Dialogue Partner
3.  Kyoto Protocol              :   Initial signatory, later withdrew
4.  Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP):   Member
5.  Artemis Accords              :   Signatory

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Australia is a full member of the G20, a leading group of major economies. It participates as a dialogue partner in the ASEAN Regional Forum, engaging in discussions on regional security and cooperation. Australia was an initial signatory to the Kyoto Protocol but later withdrew.  Australia is a member of the CPTPP, a significant trade agreement. Australia is also a signatory to the Artemis Accords, an agreement focused on international cooperation in space exploration.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to Australia's domestic political system, consider the following pairs:**

Political Feature               Description
1.  Federal System              :  Power divided between a central government and state governments
2.  Parliamentary Democracy    :  Head of government is the Prime Minister, chosen by Parliament
3.  Constitutional Monarchy      :  Head of state is the Monarch of the United Kingdom, represented by the Governor-General
4.  Dual Citizenship             :  Allowed, but with certain restrictions
5.  Senate                      :  Upper house of the federal Parliament

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Australia operates under a federal system, dividing powers between the federal government and its six states and two territories.  It's a parliamentary democracy, with the Prime Minister selected from the Parliament. Australia is a constitutional monarchy, with the British monarch as the Head of State, represented by the Governor-General.  Dual citizenship is permitted, although it can sometimes impact eligibility for certain political offices. The Senate is the upper house of the federal Parliament. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Editing Technique             Associated Enzyme/Protein
1. CRISPR-Cas9                         :   Cas9 nuclease

1.  Paris Agreement                      :  Conference of Parties (COP) of the UNFCCC
2.  Kyoto Protocol                        :  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
3.  Ramsar Convention                    :  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
4.  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) : World Meteorological Organization (WMO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Paris Agreement is an agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and its supreme decision-making body is the Conference of the Parties (COP).  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The Ramsar Convention, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands, falls under the purview of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), making pair 3 correct.  The Kyoto Protocol, designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, is supported by the IPCC but not governed by it. The IPCC is an intergovernmental body that assesses the science related to climate change, providing reports to inform policy, but it does not govern the Kyoto Protocol itself.  CITES, focused on international trade in endangered species, is not associated with the WMO. The WMO focuses on meteorology, climatology, and related geophysical sciences.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 4 are incorrectly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                  Relevant International Organization/Treaty

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India is a party to the UNFCCC, which includes the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. However,  the question asks for a specific and direct relationship.  While India reports to the UNFCCC,  the Kyoto Protocol's implementation is not directly linked to India in a uniquely defining way.  Similarly, China's participation in the Paris Agreement is not exclusive; many other nations are also involved. Australia is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, demonstrating a direct relationship, making pair 3 correct. Senegal is a signatory to the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JET-P), a financing mechanism established under the auspices of COP26, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNEP releases various reports, including the Adaptation Gap Report, correctly matching pair 2. The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) publishes the Global Landscape of Climate Finance report, making pair 4 correct. The IPCC's role is to assess the science related to climate change, not to develop emission norms for power plants; that's the responsibility of national governments and regulatory bodies.  The UNFCCC, not the WMO, hosts its own secretariat.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

5. Sumatra                          :   Sunda Strait

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Date Line crosses Alaska, marking the change between calendar days.  The Athabasca Basin in Canada is renowned for its significant uranium deposits. The Strait of Malacca is a crucial waterway bordering Malaysia. Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake, is located in Siberia. Finally, the Sunda Strait separates the islands of Sumatra and Java. All five pairs represent a correct matching of geographical locations with their significant features. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. Option (a) omits the correct pairing of Canada with the Athabasca Basin and Sumatra with the Sunda Strait. Option (b) omits the correct pairing of Alaska with the International Date Line. Option (d) incorrectly suggests that only Alaska and Sumatra are correctly paired, while omitting the other three correctly matched pairs.  A comprehensive understanding of world geography is necessary to correctly answer this question.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                     Resource
1. Canada                       :   Newsprint
2. India                          :   Bauxite
3. Malaysia                      :   Natural Rubber
4. Russia                         :   Growing Stock
5. United States                :   Coal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Canada is a major producer and exporter of newsprint, a type of paper used for newspapers. India possesses significant bauxite reserves, a key source of aluminum. Malaysia is a leading producer of natural rubber.  While Russia has vast forest resources, the term "growing stock" is a more specific forestry metric encompassing the volume of standing timber, and although relevant to their forestry sector, not a single defining resource.  The United States has extensive coal reserves and is a major coal producer. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they incorrectly include pairings that are not demonstrably accurate.  Option (b) mistakenly includes India's bauxite reserves as a major resource of Russia. Option (c) incorrectly pairs Russia's growing stock with Canada's newsprint production. Option (d) omits the correct pairings of India and the USA, limiting its scope. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of resource distribution across various countries.


**3. With reference to endangered species, consider the following pairs:**

    Species                          IUCN Status
1. Hoolock Gibbon                    :   Critically Endangered
2.  Nilgiri Tahr                      :   Vulnerable
3.  Orangutan                        :   Critically Endangered
4.  Bengal Slow Loris                :   Endangered
5.  Saiga Antelope                   : Near Threatened

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Nilgiri Tahr is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.  All three subspecies of Orangutans are critically endangered. The Saiga Antelope has recently been reclassified from Critically Endangered to Near Threatened.  However, the Hoolock Gibbon is listed as Endangered (with subspecies having varying statuses), not Critically Endangered. The Bengal Slow Loris is indeed Endangered. Thus, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs (Hoolock Gibbon as Critically Endangered or omitting the correct status for Saiga Antelope) or fail to include all the correctly matched pairs. Option (a) accurately reflects the IUCN status for Nilgiri Tahr, Orangutan, and Saiga Antelope. This question requires knowledge of conservation status and the IUCN Red List.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Protected Area                      Location
1.  Kamlang Tiger Reserve             :   Assam
2.  Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary  :   Arunachal Pradesh
3.  Palamau Tiger Reserve              :   Chhattisgarh
4.  Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary      :   Jharkhand
5.  Mukurthi National Park             :   Uttar Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kamlang Tiger Reserve is located in Arunachal Pradesh, not Assam. Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary is in Assam, not Arunachal Pradesh. Palamau Tiger Reserve is in Jharkhand, not Chhattisgarh. Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary is in Odisha, not Jharkhand. Mukurthi National Park is in Tamil Nadu, not Uttar Pradesh.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  All options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they all propose at least one incorrect pairing. This question tests knowledge of protected areas in India and their locations.


**5. With reference to invasive species, consider the following pairs:**

    Species                   Native Location
1.  Conocarpus               :   Central and South America
2.  Ludwigia peruviana        :   Tropical regions of the world
3.  Red fire ant              :   South America
4.  Primrose willow           :   North America
5.  Gambusia affinis          :   U.S.A


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The red fire ant is native to South America.  Gambusia affinis, a species of fish, is native to the United States.  However, Conocarpus is native to tropical regions worldwide, not Central and South America exclusively.  Ludwigia peruviana is native to Central and South America, not globally distributed tropical regions.  Primrose willow (Ludwigia peruviana) is native to Central and South America, not North America.  Therefore, only options 3 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  This question tests knowledge of invasive species and their native ranges.  It highlights the complexities of invasive species distribution and the importance of accurate geographical information.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Convention/Treaty                 Focus Area
1. Minamata Convention on Mercury   :   Phase-out of dental amalgam
2. UN Global Framework on Chemicals :   Phase out highly hazardous pesticides
3. Stockholm Convention              :   Control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Minamata Convention on Mercury includes a phase-down of dental amalgam and aims to reduce and eventually eliminate mercury's use in various products. The UN Global Framework on Chemicals has a target to phase out highly hazardous pesticides by 2025.  However, the Stockholm Convention focuses on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and their control, not the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes (that is the Basel Convention).  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly match the Stockholm Convention or omit a correctly matched pair.  Option (a) accurately reflects the focus areas of the Minamata Convention and the UN Global Framework on Chemicals. This question tests knowledge of international environmental agreements.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Species                    Habitat
1.  Hangul (Kashmir Stag)     :   Dachigam National Park
2.  Nilgiri Tahr                :   Eravikulam National Park
3.  Sangai Deer                :   Loktak Lake
4.  Namdapha Flying Squirrel:   Namdapha National Park
5.  Mithun                      :   Arunachal Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Hangul (Kashmir Stag) is found in Dachigam National Park in Jammu and Kashmir. The Nilgiri Tahr's largest population is in Eravikulam National Park, Kerala. The Sangai Deer is found in Loktak Lake, Manipur.  The Namdapha Flying Squirrel's range is known to include Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh.  Mithun are indeed found in Arunachal Pradesh.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests factual recall regarding the habitats of endangered species. The comprehensive nature of the question and the need for precise knowledge of each species' habitat make it a challenging question.


**8. With reference to the IUCN Red List, consider the following pairs:**

    IUCN Status                     Description
1. Critically Endangered         :   High risk of extinction in the wild
2.  Endangered                    :   Very high risk of extinction in the wild
3.  Vulnerable                     :   High risk of extinction in the wild
4.  Near Threatened                :   Likely to become endangered in the near future
5. Least Concern                  :   Low risk of extinction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Critically Endangered species face an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Endangered species face a very high risk of extinction in the wild. Near Threatened species are likely to become endangered in the near future. Least Concern species have a low risk of extinction. However, Vulnerable is also a high-risk category, but not as high as Endangered.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (a) accurately reflects the descriptions of Critically Endangered, Endangered, Near Threatened, and Least Concern categories on the IUCN Red List. This question tests understanding of the IUCN Red List categories and their definitions. The subtle differences between the categories make this a difficult question.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Protected Area                     State
1.  Dachigam National Park          :   Uttarakhand
2.  Similipal Tiger Reserve          :   Chhattisgarh
3.  Mukurthi National Park            :   Kerala
4.  Kadalundi Vallikunnu Community Reserve:   Assam
5.  Lemru Elephant Reserve           :   Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Dachigam National Park is in Jammu and Kashmir, not Uttarakhand. Similipal Tiger Reserve is in Odisha, not Chhattisgarh. Mukurthi National Park is in Tamil Nadu, not Kerala. Kadalundi Vallikunnu Community Reserve is in Kerala, not Assam. Lemru Elephant Reserve is in Chhattisgarh, not Tamil Nadu.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as each includes at least one incorrect pairing. This question tests knowledge of the location of Indian protected areas. The inclusion of several plausible distractors makes the question challenging.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Species                       Protection Status (IUCN)
1.  Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus)   :   Vulnerable
2.  Red Sand Boa                  :   Near Threatened
3.  Nilgiri Dancing Frog           :   Endangered
4.  Yellow-bellied Sea Snake       :   Least Concern
5.  Mithun                         :   Critically Endangered

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?


(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Gharial is listed as Critically Endangered, not Vulnerable. The Red Sand Boa is also Critically Endangered, not Near Threatened. The Nilgiri Dancing Frog is Vulnerable, not Endangered. The Yellow-bellied Sea Snake is Least Concern.  Mithun are not listed in the IUCN Red List. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the IUCN Red List status of various species.  The use of incorrect IUCN statuses as distractors increases the difficulty level.  The question also tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between different threat categories.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                  Function/Role
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :   Regulates the operations of commercial banks in India
2.  Hilton Young Commission               :   Established the Reserve Bank of India in 1935
3.  Controller of Currency                 :   Preceded the RBI in managing India's currency
4.  Imperial Bank of India                  :   Merged with the RBI in 1955
5.  Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (DICGC) :  Established independently of the RBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the central bank of India and plays a crucial role in regulating the nation's financial system.  One of its core functions is the supervision and regulation of commercial banks operating within the country.  This ensures the stability and soundness of the banking sector. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The Hilton Young Commission, appointed in 1926, recommended the establishment of a central bank in India.  While the commission's recommendation led to the RBI's creation, the RBI was actually established in 1935, not 1926. Hence, pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

Before the RBI's establishment, the Controller of Currency was responsible for managing India's currency.  The RBI took over these functions, making pair 3 a correct match.

The Imperial Bank of India, a predecessor to State Bank of India, was not directly merged with the RBI in 1955. The RBI took over some of its functions; however, a complete merger did not occur in that year.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrectly matched.

DICGC is an independent entity established under the RBI Act, 1934. Although the RBI plays a role in its overall functioning, DICGC is not established by the RBI. Hence, pair 5 is also incorrectly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator/Policy                RBI's Role
1. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)            :   Used by RBI as a key measure of inflation
2.  Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)       :   A reserve requirement mandated by the government, not directly controlled by the RBI
3.  Liquidity of Assets                     :   Monitored and regulated by the RBI to maintain financial stability
4.  Key Policy Rates                       :   Set by the RBI to influence monetary policy
5.  Government of India Securities        :   Managed by the RBI as part of its open market operations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RBI uses the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) as a key indicator to monitor inflation and make decisions about monetary policy.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The SLR is a reserve requirement imposed on commercial banks by the government, not a direct instrument of RBI control.  The RBI, however, monitors the SLR and its impact on liquidity.  Hence, pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

The RBI actively monitors and regulates the liquidity of assets within the banking system to ensure financial stability and prevent crises.  Pair 3 is correctly matched.

The RBI sets key policy rates, such as the repo rate and reverse repo rate, to influence borrowing costs and, consequently, the overall level of economic activity.  Thus, pair 4 is correctly matched.

The RBI manages the Government of India Securities through its open market operations, buying and selling these securities to influence liquidity and interest rates. Pair 5 is also correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Organization       Relationship with RBI
1. Unit Trust of India (UTI)                :   Established and initially overseen by the RBI
2.  Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) :  Established independently of the RBI
3.  National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) :  Established independently of the RBI
4.  Discount and Finance House of India    :   Established and initially overseen by the RBI
5. Commercial Banks                      :  Regulated by the RBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RBI played a significant role in the establishment and early supervision of the Unit Trust of India (UTI), a mutual fund.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

IDBI and NABARD were established as independent institutions, although they operate within the broader regulatory framework of the RBI.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are incorrectly matched.


The RBI played a crucial role in the initial establishment and operational oversight of the Discount and Finance House of India, although it is now an independent institution. Hence, pair 4 is correctly matched.

Commercial banks in India are subject to regulation and supervision by the RBI.  This ensures the stability and soundness of the banking sector. Therefore, pair 5 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     RBI's Involvement
1. Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934             :   Provides the legal framework for the RBI's establishment and operations
2.  Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets  :   Developed and implemented by the RBI
3.  PSS Act, 2007                               :   The RBI is designated as an authority under this Act
4.  Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA)              :   The RBI's guidelines influence the implementation of ICAs
5.  Greenwashing TechSprint                     :   The RBI participated in this initiative


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, is the foundational legislation that established the RBI and outlines its powers and functions. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The RBI developed and implemented the Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets to address the issue of non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking sector.  Pair 2 is correctly matched.

The RBI is designated as an authority under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSS Act).  Pair 3 is correctly matched.

The RBI's guidelines and regulations significantly influence the structure and implementation of Inter Creditor Agreements (ICAs) which are used for resolving stressed assets. Pair 4 is correctly matched.

The RBI actively participated in the Greenwashing TechSprint, a collaborative initiative focusing on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in the financial sector.  Therefore, pair 5 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Commission                 Area of Focus/Recommendation
1. T.V. Somanathan Committee            :   Pension system review for employees
2.  J.S. Verma Committee                 :   Amendments to criminal laws
3.  Hema Committee                       :   Working conditions of women in the film industry
4.  Committee of Secretaries              :   Sub-categorisation of scheduled castes in reservations
5.  P. Ramachandra Raju Commission       :   Sub-categorisation of scheduled castes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The T.V. Somanathan committee was tasked with reviewing the pension system for government employees in India.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The J.S. Verma Committee was established to review and recommend amendments to the criminal laws of India, particularly in relation to sexual assault cases.  Pair 2 is correctly matched.

The Hema Committee submitted a report on the working conditions of women in the Malayalam film industry following a sexual assault case.  Pair 3 is correctly matched.

A Committee of Secretaries was formed to look into the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes in reservations. Pair 4 is correctly matched.

The P. Ramachandra Raju Commission also dealt with the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes. Pair 5 is correctly matched.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the facts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Court Decision                                      Related Legal Concept
1.  Aruna Shanbaug Case                          :   Active Euthanasia
2.  Jalaluddin Khan v. Union of India           :   Right to Information
3.  Berubari Union Dispute                       :   Constitutionality of Law
4.  Supreme Court overruling Rajasthan High Court :   Public Interest Litigation (PIL)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Aruna Shanbaug case dealt with passive euthanasia, not active euthanasia. Active euthanasia involves a deliberate act to end a life, while passive euthanasia involves withholding life-sustaining treatment.  The Supreme Court's decision in *Jalaluddin Khan v. Union of India* significantly impacted the Right to Information, but the case itself wasn't solely about defining or establishing that right. The Berubari Union dispute primarily concerned the constitutionality of a particular law related to territorial boundaries.  The Supreme Court's power to overturn High Court decisions is a key element of its appellate jurisdiction and is closely related to the evolution and application of Public Interest Litigation (PIL), making option (d) the only correct match.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Organization/Body                     Action/Function
1.  WCD Ministry                                    :   Established the National Anti-Doping Agency
2.  Parliament                                       :   Defined the scope of Child Care Leave (CCL)
3.  Supreme Court of India                          :   Approved the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)
4.  Ministry of New & Renewable Energy            :   Launched SHe-Box portal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Women and Child Development (WCD) Ministry is involved in child welfare, but the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) falls under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports.  The scope of Child Care Leave (CCL) is primarily defined by rules and regulations within the government's framework, a function of Parliament's legislative powers. The Union Cabinet, not the Supreme Court, approves government schemes like the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS). The Ministry of Women and Child Development launched the SHe-Box portal. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the relationship between the government body and its action.


**3. With reference to the Indian legal system, consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept                                   Associated Body/Article
1.  Original Jurisdiction                             :   Rajasthan High Court
2.  Advisory Jurisdiction                            :   Article 21
3.  Power of Judicial Review                         :   Supreme Court of India
4.  Interpretation of Article 21                     :   Justice J.S. Verma Committee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Original jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to hear a case for the first time, and it is a power held by various courts, including the Supreme Court of India, not exclusively the Rajasthan High Court.  Advisory jurisdiction is a power of the Supreme Court, not directly defined by Article 21, which deals with fundamental rights. The Supreme Court of India possesses the power of judicial review, which is a core aspect of its function. The Justice J.S. Verma Committee made recommendations on legal matters, but it did not interpret Article 21. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization/Institution                              Associated Award/Initiative
1.  Global Finance Magazine                          :   Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar
2.  Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust                   :   Annapurna Certificate
3.  Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports               :   STAR metric
4.  UNEP                                              :   Food Waste Index Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Global Finance Magazine publishes the Central Banker Report Cards, not the Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar. The Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust awards the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize, not the Annapurna Certificate, which is an initiative of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).  The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports oversees the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA), but the STAR metric is an initiative of the IUCN.  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) does indeed publish the Food Waste Index Report.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to India's space program, consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission/Technology                         Developing/Implementing Agency
1.  Chandrayaan-3                                  :   NASA
2.  Gaganyaan Mission                              :   ISRO
3.  National Space Day                             :   Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
4.  Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Technology     :   ISRO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 is an Indian mission, executed by ISRO, not NASA.  The Gaganyaan mission is indeed an ISRO initiative.  While the Ministry of Science and Technology plays a significant role in India's space program, the declaration of National Space Day is a government-wide initiative and not solely under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.  ISRO has been actively developing RLV technology. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Personality                      Award Received
1. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam           : Bharat Ratna
2. Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan    : Bharat Ratna
3. Pranab Mukherjee                 : Bharat Ratna
4.  Govind Ballabh Pant             : Bharat Ratna
5.  Mohammad Hidayatullah           : Bharat Ratna

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five personalities listed—Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Pranab Mukherjee, Govind Ballabh Pant, and Mohammad Hidayatullah—have been recipients of the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded in recognition of exceptional service towards the nation, encompassing various fields such as art, literature, science, public service, and social work.  Each individual's contribution to India earned them this prestigious honor.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete, failing to acknowledge the Bharat Ratna conferred upon all five listed individuals.  The comprehensive nature of option (d) makes it the only correct answer.  Understanding the significance of the Bharat Ratna and the diverse achievements of its recipients is crucial for UPSC preparation, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the award and its recipients' contributions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Dance Form                     State of Origin
1. Mohiniyattam                    : Tamil Nadu
2. Garba                            :  Gujarat
3. Lavani                          : Maharashtra
4. Kalbeliya                       : Rajasthan
5. Kathakali                       : Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Garba (Gujarat) and Lavani (Maharashtra) are correctly paired. Garba is a vibrant folk dance form primarily associated with the Navratri festival in Gujarat, while Lavani is a traditional dance style from Maharashtra, often performed with singing and clapping.  The other options present inaccuracies. Mohiniyattam originates in Kerala, not Tamil Nadu. Kalbeliya is associated with Rajasthan, not another state. Kathakali is a classical dance form from Kerala, not Andhra Pradesh.  Therefore, only option (a) accurately reflects the correct state of origin for Garba and Lavani.  The question tests factual recall of Indian classical and folk dance forms and their geographical associations, a relevant area for UPSC examinations.


**3. With reference to Indian Independence Movement, consider the following pairs:**

    Newspaper                     Published By
1.  New India                     : Mahatma Gandhi
2.  Commonweal                   : Annie Besant
3.  Indian Opinion                 : Gopal Krishna Gokhale
4.  Voice of India                  : Dadabhai Naoroji
5.  Hindu Review                  : Bal Gangadhar Tilak

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Annie Besant published *Commonweal* and Dadabhai Naoroji published *Voice of India*. These newspapers played crucial roles in disseminating nationalist ideas and mobilizing public opinion during the Indian Independence Movement.  The other options contain incorrect pairings.  *New India* was associated with Annie Besant, not Mahatma Gandhi.  *Indian Opinion* was primarily associated with Mahatma Gandhi during his time in South Africa and later. *Hindu Review* was founded by Ganesh Ganesh, not Bal Gangadhar Tilak, although Tilak was a significant contributor. The question assesses factual recall of newspapers and their publishers, crucial for understanding the dissemination of ideas during the Indian freedom struggle—a key area in UPSC syllabi.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Personality                     Book Authored
1.  Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam       : The Presidential Years
2.  Pranab Mukherjee              : The Presidential Years
3.  R.C. Dutt                      : The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore
4.  Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan : The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore
5.  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar   : Barno-Porichoy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam authored *The Presidential Years*, and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar authored *Barno-Porichoy*.  These are well-established facts about their respective literary contributions. The other options are incorrect.  Pranab Mukherjee also wrote a memoir titled *The Presidential Years*, creating a plausible distractor.  However,  it's crucial to note that multiple individuals can author books with the same title.  R.C. Dutt and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan did not author *The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore*;  while Radhakrishnan wrote extensively on philosophy, the specific book is incorrectly attributed. This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar titles and recall specific authors of important works, reflecting the importance of detailed factual knowledge in the UPSC exam.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    President of India              Action Related to the Constitution
1. Dr. Rajendra Prasad            :  Withheld assent to the PEPSU Appropriation Bill
2.  Pranab Mukherjee              :  Served as a member of the Drafting Committee
3.  Ram Nath Kovind               :  Signed the 42nd Amendment
4.  Mohammad Hidayatullah        :  Served as Acting President
5.  Ramaswamy Venkataraman       :  First President to use Hindi in the Presidential Address

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Dr. Rajendra Prasad, as President of India, withheld assent to the PEPSU Appropriation Bill, exercising his constitutional powers.  Mohammad Hidayatullah served as Acting President of India, a role related to the functioning of the Constitution, albeit indirectly. The other options are incorrect. Pranab Mukherjee was not a member of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution. Ram Nath Kovind did not sign the 42nd Amendment.  The claim that Ramaswamy Venkataraman was the first President to use Hindi in his address is not definitively supported by historical evidence. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian President's role in the constitutional framework, requiring both factual recall and a nuanced understanding of presidential powers.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Festival                       State Primarily Celebrated In
1. Onam                           : Tamil Nadu
2. Jivitputrika (Jitiya)         : Bihar
3. Lai Haraoba                    : Manipur
4. Shigmo                         : Goa
5. Karma                           : Gujarat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Jivitputrika (Jitiya) is primarily celebrated in Bihar, Lai Haraoba in Manipur, and Shigmo in Goa.  These are well-established facts about the geographical distribution of these festivals. The other options contain incorrect pairings. Onam is the harvest festival of Kerala, not Tamil Nadu.  Karma is celebrated in various states of central and eastern India, including Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha, but not primarily in Gujarat. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of major Indian festivals and their regional distribution, requiring accurate factual recall. The inclusion of distractors like Onam and Karma, known festivals but paired incorrectly, makes the question challenging.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                           State/Region Primarily Found In
1. Konyak                          : Nagaland
2. Irula                           : Andhra Pradesh
3. Poumai Naga                     : Manipur
4. Mankidia                         : Odisha
5. Warli                           : Gujarat

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Konyak tribe is primarily found in Nagaland, and the Poumai Naga tribe is primarily located in Manipur.  These are accurate geographical locations for these tribal communities.  The other options are incorrect. The Irula tribe is found in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, not Andhra Pradesh. The Mankidia community is a part of the Birhor tribe primarily found in Jharkhand, not Odisha.  The Warli tribe is predominantly located in Maharashtra, not Gujarat.  This question tests knowledge of various Indian tribal groups and their geographical locations, requiring precise factual knowledge.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings increases the difficulty level, aligning with UPSC exam standards.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Personality                      Position Held
1. Jawaharlal Nehru                : President of India
2. Govind Ballabh Pant             : Chief Justice of India
3. Dr. Rajendra Prasad             : Vice President of India
4. Ramaswamy Venkataraman        : Acting President of India
5. Mohammad Hidayatullah          : Chief Justice of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ramaswamy Venkataraman served as Acting President of India, and Mohammad Hidayatullah served as Chief Justice of India.  These are verifiable facts about their respective careers.  The other options are incorrect because Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister, not President of India. Govind Ballabh Pant was a prominent politician and held various ministerial positions but never served as Chief Justice of India. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the first President, not Vice President of India. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant Indian personalities and the positions they held, requiring accurate recall of facts and differentiation among similar roles within the Indian political system. The use of plausible but inaccurate pairings enhances the question's difficulty.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Operation                         Purpose
1. Operation Polo                    : Integration of Hyderabad
2. Operation Sadbhavana              : Counter-insurgency in Kashmir
3. Operation Meghdoot                : Securing Siachen Glacier
4. Operation Cactus                  : Intervention in Maldives
5. Operation Vijay                   : Liberation of Goa


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Operation Polo was launched by India to integrate the princely state of Hyderabad. Operation Meghdoot was the Indian military operation to secure the Siachen Glacier. Operation Cactus was the Indian military intervention in the Maldives. These are all well-documented historical events. Option (a) correctly identifies these matches. The other options are incorrect. Operation Sadbhavana was a confidence-building measure initiated in Jammu and Kashmir, not a counter-insurgency operation. Operation Vijay was the military operation to liberate Goa, Daman and Diu from Portuguese rule.  This question tests knowledge of Indian military operations and their historical context, demanding specific recall of events and their purposes. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings makes the question challenging and tests the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding operations.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Poona Pact:**

1. It was signed in 1932.
2. It was signed between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar.
3. It resulted in the abolition of separate electorates for the depressed classes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct regarding the Poona Pact.  The Poona Pact, a significant agreement in the Indian independence movement, was indeed signed in 1932.  The key negotiators were Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, representing the interests of the Congress and the depressed classes, respectively.  The pact's most significant outcome was the abolition of separate electorates for the depressed classes, replacing them with reserved seats within the general electorate.  This event is a critical component of understanding the complexities of the Indian independence movement and the socio-political dynamics of the time. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the historical context and the key players involved in a pivotal political agreement. The options are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of this event, particularly the year and the outcome.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question features 3-5 pairs and uses either option format 1 or 2.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult'.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                     Chief Minister (at some point in time)
1.  Uttar Pradesh            :   Lal Bahadur Shastri
2.  Gujarat                  :   Narendra Modi
3.  Bihar                    :   Sachchidananda Sinha
4.  Karnataka                :   H.D. Deve Gowda
5.  Chhattisgarh             :    None of the below

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lal Bahadur Shastri served as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Narendra Modi served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Sachchidananda Sinha held the position of Chief Minister in Bihar.  H.D. Deve Gowda served as the Chief Minister of Karnataka.  The question includes a distractor (Chhattisgarh) to make it more challenging, as the provided text does not explicitly state a Chief Minister for that state.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrect pairing for Chhattisgarh. The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify correct pairings amidst distractors.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                      Capital City
1.  Rajasthan                 :   Jodhpur
2.  Assam                     :   Guwahati
3.  Kerala                    :   Kochi
4.  Tamil Nadu                :   Madras
5.  Madhya Pradesh            :   Jabalpur

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct matches are Assam's capital being Guwahati and Madhya Pradesh's capital being Jabalpur.  The question deliberately includes incorrect pairings for Rajasthan (Jodhpur, while Jaipur is correct), Kerala (Kochi, while Thiruvananthapuram is correct), and Tamil Nadu (Madras, while Chennai is the current capital). This tests factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between current and historical capitals.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include only one correct pair or incorrectly include a false pairing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Park/Reserve        State
1.  Keibul Lamjao National Park:  Assam
2.  Kaziranga National Park     :  Manipur
3.  Ranthambore National Park  :  Rajasthan
4.  Sundarbans National Park   :  West Bengal
5.  Silent Valley National Park :  Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ranthambore National Park is correctly paired with Rajasthan, and Sundarbans National Park is correctly paired with West Bengal. The question includes distractors to test detailed knowledge of Indian geography and protected areas.  Keibul Lamjao National Park is in Manipur, not Assam; Kaziranga National Park is in Assam, not Manipur; and Silent Valley National Park is in Kerala, not Karnataka. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they wrongly include one or more incorrect pairs.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Festival                     State
1.  Onam                       :   Tamil Nadu
2.  Kati Bihu                   :   Odisha
3.  Pushkaralu                  :   Uttar Pradesh

5.  Raja Parba                  :   Kerala

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the Hornbill Festival is correctly matched with Nagaland.  The other options include several mismatched pairs. Onam is a festival of Kerala, not Tamil Nadu; Kati Bihu is celebrated in Assam, not Odisha; Pushkaralu is associated with Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, not Uttar Pradesh; and Raja Parba is an Odia festival, not a festival of Kerala. This question tests factual recall of Indian festivals and their locations. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of several incorrect pairings.


**5.  With reference to prominent Indian personalities, consider the following pairs:**

   Person                       Significant Contribution/Association
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji             :   Formulation of the Drain of Wealth theory
2.  Govind Ballabh Pant         :   Establishment of Hindi as an official language
3.  Sakthan Thampuran          :   Rule over the Cochin kingdom
4.  Periyar E.V. Ramasamy      :   Self-Respect Movement
5.  Alluri Sitarama Raju        :   Rampa Rebellion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Dadabhai Naoroji is known for his Drain of Wealth theory; Govind Ballabh Pant played a key role in establishing Hindi's official status; Sakthan Thampuran ruled the Cochin kingdom; Periyar E.V. Ramasamy spearheaded the Self-Respect Movement; and Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion.  This question tests factual recall of significant contributions of prominent Indian figures. All other options are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                       Major Crop/Industry
1.  Gujarat                    :   Cotton Production
2.  Tamil Nadu                 :    Tea production
3.  West Bengal                :    Jute production
4.  Assam                      :    Rice production
5.  Madhya Pradesh            :   Diamond production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gujarat is a major cotton producer; West Bengal leads in jute production; Assam is known for its rice cultivation; and Madhya Pradesh has significant diamond reserves.  Tamil Nadu is a major producer of rice, not tea. This question tests knowledge of agricultural and industrial outputs of different states.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect, as they exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrect pairing for Tamil Nadu.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Art Form                     State/Region of Origin
1.  Pichwai Painting           :   Gujarat
2.  Garba                       :   Rajasthan
3.  Kathakali                   :   Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only Mohiniyattam is correctly linked to its origin in Kerala.  The other options contain several incorrect pairings. Pichwai painting originates in Rajasthan, not Gujarat; Garba is a Gujarati dance form, not from Rajasthan; Kathakali is a Keralite art form, not from Tamil Nadu; and Kalbelia dance originates in Rajasthan, not Madhya Pradesh. This question assesses the ability to recall the origins of different art forms in India.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include false pairings.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Archaeological Site           Civilization/Period
1.  Lothal                      :   Harappan Civilization
2.  Kalibangan                   :   Indus Valley Civilization
3.  Rakhigarhi                   :   Indus Valley Civilization
4.  Dholavira                    :   Harappan Civilization
5.  Alamgirpur                  :   Indus Valley Civilization

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lothal, Dholavira, Kalibangan, and Rakhigarhi are all associated with the Harappan Civilization or Indus Valley Civilization.  Alamgirpur's association is debated and not definitively placed within the Indus Valley Civilization. The question tests knowledge of major Harappan sites. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the uncertain pairing for Alamgirpur.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Language                    Language Family
1.  Poula                       :   Sino-Tibetan

(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Santhali belongs to the Munda language family; Tamil belongs to the Dravidian family; and Kui is part of the Austro-Asiatic family.  Poula is a Naga language, but its classification as Sino-Tibetan is not universally agreed upon and requires further verification, making it a distractor. Kokborok belongs to the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan family, not Austro-Asiatic. This question tests knowledge of Indian language families and their classifications.  The distractors make this question difficult. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccurate classifications of Poula and Kokborok.

   Tribe                         State where primarily located
1.  Konyak                      :   Manipur

(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Munda and Baiga tribes are correctly matched with their primary locations in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh respectively.  The other options include several mismatched pairs. Konyak tribe is primarily found in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, not Manipur; Irula tribe is found in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala, not Arunachal Pradesh; and Hakki Pikki tribe is found in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and some other states, not Kerala. This question assesses the understanding of the geographical distribution of various tribal groups in India, making it challenging due to the spread of some tribes across multiple states. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they contain several incorrect pairings.

The Paika Rebellion was a significant uprising of the Paika community in Odisha against the British East India Company.  The Champaran Satyagraha, initiated by Mahatma Gandhi, was a landmark event in Bihar against the oppressive indigo plantation system. All four pairs correctly match the state with a prominent historical event that occurred within its boundaries.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The events listed are all significant historical events in their respective states, showcasing diverse forms of resistance and social movements during different periods of Indian history.  Understanding these events is crucial for comprehending the socio-political landscape of India.

**Explanation:**

Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar played a pivotal role in reforming Bengali prose, making it more accessible to the common people. His contributions significantly shaped modern Bengali literature. Raja Ravi Varma was a pioneering figure in introducing lithography to Indian art, which enabled mass reproduction of his paintings, making them accessible to a wider audience. Annie Besant achieved the distinction of being the first woman president of the Indian National Congress in 1917, a significant milestone in Indian political history.  All three pairs accurately connect the individuals with their major contributions. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding these figures' contributions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of India's social and cultural reform movements, as well as its struggle for independence.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Shigmo is a spring festival celebrated in Goa. Lai Haraoba is a significant festival in Manipur, characterized by the worship of local deities. Jitiya or Jivitputrika is a Hindu festival observed in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Nepal.  Bathukamma is primarily celebrated in Telangana, not Andhra Pradesh.  Therefore, only the first three pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched Bathukamma Festival. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.  These festivals represent the rich diversity of cultural practices across different regions of India, reflecting the unique traditions and beliefs of various communities.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Mankidia (or Mankirdia) tribe is primarily found in Odisha. The Poumai Naga tribe inhabits both Manipur and Nagaland. The Birhor tribe has a wider distribution across several states including Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and West Bengal.  All three pairs correctly identify the primary regions inhabited by these tribes.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incorrect as they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.  These examples highlight the diverse tribal populations across India, each with its unique cultural and linguistic characteristics.  Understanding the geographical distribution of these tribes is vital for effective policy-making and inclusive development.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Known For
1.  Dr. Satish Dhawan        :   Father of experimental fluid dynamics research in India

Dr. Satish Dhawan is widely recognized as the father of experimental fluid dynamics research in India and played a crucial role in the development of India's space program. Bhagat Singh is revered as Shaheed-e-Azam (Greatest Martyr) for his contributions to India's independence movement. Annie Besant holds the distinction of being the first woman president of the Indian National Congress.  All three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect, as they omit at least one correctly matched pair. These individuals represent significant contributions to India’s scientific advancement, freedom struggle, and political landscape, respectively.  Their achievements are important aspects of India's history and progress.


**7. With reference to the Poona Pact, consider the following pairs:**

1.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar       :   Represented Untouchables
2.  Mahatma Gandhi           :   Represented the Indian National Congress
3.  B.G. Tilak                 :   Key negotiator


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Poona Pact was a crucial agreement between Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, representing the interests of the Untouchables (Dalits), and Mahatma Gandhi, representing the Indian National Congress.  While both played key roles, B.G. Tilak was not directly involved in the negotiations of the Poona Pact.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair concerning B.G. Tilak. Options (a) and (c) are also incorrect as they do not include all the correctly matched pairs. The Poona Pact was a significant event in India's social and political history, demonstrating the complexities of caste politics and the struggle for social justice during the pre-independence era.  The pact significantly altered the political landscape for Dalits in India.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Architectural Style      Key Feature
1. Dravidian Architecture :   Gopuram
2. Kalinga Architecture    :   Jagamohana
3. Hoysala Architecture   :   Stellate Plan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Dravidian architectural style is characterized by the presence of Gopurams (tall, ornate gateways) in its temples.  Kalinga architecture, a blend of Nagara and Dravidian styles, typically features a Jagamohana (assembly hall) as a key component of its temple structure.  Hoysala temples are known for their unique stellate plan (star-shaped).  All three pairs accurately match the architectural styles with their defining features.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incorrect as they do not include all correctly matched pairs.  Knowledge of these architectural styles helps in understanding the regional variations and historical influences in Indian temple architecture.  The evolution and fusion of architectural styles across different regions of India are important for understanding the country’s cultural history.


**9. With reference to the Swachh Iconic Places initiative, consider the following pairs:**

   Government Program           Religious Site
1. Swachh Iconic Places initiative :  Konark Sun Temple
2. Swachh Bharat Mission       :   Tirupati Temple
3. Swachh Iconic Places initiative :   Sharda Temple

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Swachh Iconic Places initiative aims to improve the cleanliness and hygiene of significant religious and heritage sites across India. While the Tirupati Temple is indeed a significant site, there is no explicit mention of it being part of the Swachh Iconic Places initiative within the source material.  The Konark Sun Temple is not mentioned in the source material as being involved in the Swachh Iconic Places initiative either.  However, the Sharda Temple's mention in relation to recent news events allows for a plausible link to such an initiative. Therefore, only the pair connecting the Swachh Iconic Places initiative and the Sharda Temple can be definitively confirmed as correctly matched based on the provided information.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or fail to include the correctly matched pair. The Swachh Iconic Places initiative is a crucial government program aimed at improving the hygiene and sanitation of important cultural and religious sites, promoting sustainable tourism and cultural preservation.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization               Location
1.  UNWTO                     :   Madrid, Spain
2.  Indian Olympic Association :   New Delhi, India
3.  Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) :   Hyderabad, India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organization) is headquartered in Madrid, Spain.  While the Indian Olympic Association is based in India, New Delhi is not explicitly stated as its location in the provided text.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has offices across India, including Hyderabad, but it does not have its headquarters there.  Therefore, only the pair correctly matching the UNWTO with its headquarters is definitively correct.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. The UNWTO plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable tourism globally, while the Indian Olympic Association and the Archaeological Survey of India are pivotal national organizations involved in sports management and cultural heritage preservation respectively.  Knowing their locations is helpful in understanding their operational structures and reach.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                                   Governing Body
    1. Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 :  Ministry of Corporate Affairs
    2. Mutual Funds Regulations, 1996               :  Reserve Bank of India
    3. Foreign Venture Capital Investors (Amendment) Regulations, 2024 :  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Act, 1992, establishes SEBI as the regulator for securities markets in India.  It is not governed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs; rather, it operates independently under its own Act. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.  The Mutual Funds Regulations, 1996, are indeed enacted by SEBI, not the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which primarily focuses on monetary policy and banking regulation. Thus, pair 2 is incorrect.  The Foreign Venture Capital Investors (Amendment) Regulations, 2024, are correctly paired with SEBI as SEBI is responsible for regulating foreign investment in Indian securities markets. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Option (b) accurately reflects this.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept/Indicator                    Related Measure/Concept
    1. Fiscal Deficit                               :  Revenue Deficit
    2. Revenue Deficit                              :  Primary Deficit
    3. Primary Deficit                              :  Total Expenditure
    4. Total Expenditure                           : Total Receipts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A fiscal deficit represents the excess of total government expenditure (revenue and capital) over total receipts (revenue and capital) including borrowings.  A revenue deficit is a subset of this, representing the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. A revenue deficit is further broken down to include the primary deficit, which excludes interest payments on debt. Thus, pair 2 is correctly matched. The primary deficit is a component of the fiscal deficit, reflecting the government's borrowing needs excluding interest payments.  Pair 3 is correctly matched. A fiscal deficit is the difference between total government expenditure and total government receipts (excluding borrowings).  Pair 4 is incorrectly matched as total expenditure and total receipts are used to calculate the fiscal deficit, but they are not directly paired. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    River                                       Location
    1. Sutlej River                               :  Karnataka
    2. Yangtze River                             :  China
    3. Pamba River                               :  Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sutlej River is a major tributary of the Indus River system, primarily flowing through the states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. It does not flow through Karnataka. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia and flows through China. Hence, pair 2 is correctly matched. The Pamba River is a significant river in Kerala, flowing into the Arabian Sea. It does not flow through Tamil Nadu. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Dam                                          State
    1. Three Gorges Dam                           :  India
    2. Bhakra Nangal Dam                         :  Himachal Pradesh
    3.  Krishna Raja Sagar Dam                    :  Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Three Gorges Dam is located on the Yangtze River in China, not India. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Bhakra Nangal Dam is situated on the Sutlej River and primarily located in Himachal Pradesh.  Thus, pair 2 is correctly matched. The Krishna Raja Sagar Dam is located in Karnataka, not Tamil Nadu. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                             Description
    1. Retail Inflation                             :  Increase in input prices
    2. Wholesale Price Inflation                  :  Consumer Price Index (CPI)
    3. Consumer Price Inflation (CPI)              :  Increase in prices of goods and services purchased by consumers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Retail inflation reflects the increase in prices of goods and services that consumers purchase. While input price reductions can contribute to lower retail inflation, they are not the direct definition. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Wholesale Price Inflation (WPI) measures the change in prices at the wholesale level, not the consumer level; it is not directly equivalent to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) accurately measures the increase in prices of goods and services bought by consumers. Hence, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Company Type                                 Regulatory Body
    1. Nidhi Companies                            :  Reserve Bank of India
    2.  Regional Rural Banks                     :  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
    3.  All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs)   :  Reserve Bank of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Nidhi companies are governed under Section 406 of the Companies Act, 2013, and are primarily involved in borrowing and lending among their members. They are regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, not the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  Regional Rural Banks are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.  All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) are indeed regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. Only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Technique/Concept                  Characteristic
    1. Precision Farming                           : Uses only traditional methods
    2. Fertigation                                 :  A type of irrigation
    3. Drip Irrigation                             : A type of precision farming

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Precision farming utilizes technology like GPS, remote sensing, and variable rate technology to optimize resource use in agriculture. It does not rely solely on traditional methods. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Fertigation is a method of applying fertilizers through irrigation systems, making it a type of irrigation. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Drip irrigation is a specific type of irrigation technique often used within precision farming systems, but it's not the defining characteristic of precision farming itself. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    State                                        Economic Characteristic in 2023-24 (approx.)
    1. Karnataka                                  :  30% of India's GDP
    2. Andhra Pradesh                             :  10% of India's GDP
    3. Telangana                                  :  5% of India's GDP
    4. Gujarat                                    : Per capita income exceeding national average since 1960s.
    5. Maharashtra                               : Per capita income exceeding national average since 1960s.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu together accounted for approximately 30% of India's GDP in 2023-24,  it's inaccurate to assign 30% to Karnataka alone. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  Similarly, assigning specific percentages to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana individually from the aggregate 30% is an oversimplification and thus pairs 2 and 3 are incorrect.  However, both Gujarat and Maharashtra have consistently had per capita incomes above the national average since the 1960s. Therefore, pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tax Type                                      Description
    1. Windfall Tax                               : Taxes profits from unprecedented events
    2. Pigouvian Tax                              :  Taxes negative externalities
    3. Corporate Tax                             : Taxes company profits generally

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A windfall tax is specifically designed to tax the exceptional profits a company makes due to an unexpected external event (e.g., the surge in energy prices).  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. A Pigouvian tax is levied on activities that generate negative externalities (e.g., pollution), aiming to internalize the cost of these externalities. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Corporate tax is a general tax on a company's profits, encompassing various sources of income. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Milk Production in India                     Characteristic
    1.  India                                     : Second largest milk producer globally
    2. Operation Flood                           : Substantially increased milk production
    3. White Revolution 2.0                     : Aims to procure 1000 lakh kg milk daily by 2029

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India is the world's largest milk producer. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. Operation Flood significantly increased milk production through cooperative dairy farming, making pair 2 correctly matched. White Revolution 2.0 aims to increase milk procurement to 1000 lakh kilograms per day by 2029, focusing on women's empowerment. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India was the world's largest rice exporter for many years.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. China is indeed the world's largest rice producer. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  While Vietnam is a major rice producer, it is not the second largest globally; India holds that position. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Sector                                         Priority Sector Lending (PSL) Eligibility

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Agriculture, MSMEs, and Renewable Energy are all sectors eligible for priority sector lending (PSL) as defined by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  Education is not traditionally included in the RBI's definition of PSL. Therefore, three statements are correct.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Ministry/Department
    1. Central Silk Board                             : Ministry of Textiles
    2. National Turmeric Board                      : Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
    3. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) : Ministry of Finance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Central Silk Board is a statutory body under the Ministry of Textiles, not the Ministry of Agriculture.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The National Turmeric Board falls under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. NABARD is a development financial institution under the Ministry of Finance.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Program                     Objective/Focus
    1. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) : Income support to landholding farmers
    2. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)    :  Crop insurance for all farmers
    3. Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0: Water security and sanitation in cities

How many of the statements given above are correct?
(a) Only one

**Explanation:**

PM-KISAN provides income support to eligible landholding farmer families. PMFBY provides comprehensive crop insurance. AMRUT 2.0 focuses on water security and improved sanitation in urban areas.  All three statements accurately reflect the objectives of these schemes.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Program                     Key Feature
    1. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) : Houses for all eligible families by 2024
    2.  AMRUT 2.0                                  : Outcome-based funding for cities
    3.  National Common Mobility Card (NCMC)      : Interoperable transport card system

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PMAY-U aims to provide housing to all eligible urban families. AMRUT 2.0 uses an outcome-based funding model for cities.  The NCMC is designed to create an interoperable transport card.  All three pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Act          |  Associated Act/Article/Policy
   -----------------------------|---------------------------------
   1.  GST Council                 |  Article 279A
   2.  Parliament                  |  Article 269-A
   3.  101st Amendment Act 2016 |  Article 279A
   4.  Article 269-A              |  GST Revenue Distribution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279A of the Constitution through the 101st Amendment Act, 2016.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The 101st Amendment Act introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and established the GST Council.  While Parliament is involved in the GST system and Article 269-A relates to the GST, it doesn't directly establish the council.  Article 269-A deals with the apportionment of GST revenue between the Union and the States, a function of the GST Council.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect because it links Parliament directly to Article 269A, which is more accurately a consequence of the GST system's establishment. Pair 4 is also incorrect because while the GST Council makes recommendations on GST revenue distribution, Article 269-A itself governs the principles of this distribution. The direct link between Article 269-A and GST revenue distribution is more accurate than the link proposed in pair 4.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Savings Scheme             |  Fund/Governing Body
   ---------------------------|--------------------------
   1.  PPF                        |  National Small Savings Fund (NSSF)
   2.  NSC                        |  National Small Savings Fund (NSSF)
   3.  KVP                        |  Central Government
   4.  Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme |  National Small Savings Fund (NSSF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC), and Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme are all small savings instruments managed by the central government, and the money raised from these schemes goes into the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF). Thus, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  However, the Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP) is also a small savings instrument, but its direct link to the NSSF might not be as explicitly stated as for the other three.  The central government manages the overall small savings scheme, which includes KVP. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched as it doesn't explicitly state the NSSF's involvement.


**3. Consider the following statements:**

   Statement                          |   Correct/Incorrect
   -----------------------------------|---------------------
   1.  PACS are refinanced by RBI.     |    Incorrect
   2.  PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act. |  Correct
   3.  SCBs/DCCBs are regulated by RBI. | Correct
   4. PACS deal directly with farmers. | Correct


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) are village-level cooperative credit societies that serve as the last link in a three-tier cooperative credit structure.  They are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  State Cooperative Banks (SCBs) and District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) are connected to the Core Banking Software and are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  However, PACS are not regulated by the RBI.  PACS directly provide short-term lending (crop loans) to farmers.  Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because PACS are refinanced by NABARD, not the RBI.  The RBI's regulatory oversight is primarily focused on SCBs and DCCBs within the cooperative banking structure.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Body          |  Function/Regulation
   ---------------------------------|-----------------------------
   1.  SEBI                           |  Regulates securities market
   2.  RBI                            |  Regulates Nidhi Companies
   3.  NABARD                         |  Refinances PACS
   4.  ICFRE                          |  Issues Green Credits


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the regulatory authority for the securities and capital markets in India.  NABARD refinances PACS through DCCBs and SCBs. The Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) issues Green Credits under the Green Credit Program. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrect because Nidhi companies are governed by the Companies Act, 2013, and are not regulated by the RBI. The RBI's regulatory mandate primarily focuses on banks and other financial institutions under its purview, not Nidhi companies which operate under a different regulatory framework.


**5. Consider the following statements about fiscal deficit:**

   Statement                                      | Correct/Incorrect
   -------------------------------------------------|---------------------
   1.  Fiscal deficit is the excess of total expenditure over total receipts excluding borrowings. | Correct
   2.  Fiscal deficit is calculated as Total Expenditure – (Revenue Receipts + Debt Creating Capital Receipts). | Incorrect
   3.  A reduction in fiscal deficit leads to a decline in government debt as a percentage of GDP. | Correct


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fiscal deficit is defined as the excess of total budget expenditure (revenue and capital) over total budget receipts (revenue and capital) excluding borrowings during a fiscal year.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect because the formula for fiscal deficit excludes debt-creating capital receipts, not includes them.  Debt-creating capital receipts increase the fiscal deficit.  A reduction in the fiscal deficit implies that the government is borrowing less, which, over time, leads to a decline in government debt as a percentage of GDP.  Therefore, statement 3 is correct.  The relationship between fiscal deficit and government debt is crucial for macroeconomic stability.  A consistently high fiscal deficit can lead to unsustainable levels of government debt.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                               |  Largest Fish Producer (2022-23)
   -----------------------------------|----------------------------------
   1.  Andhra Pradesh                 |  West Bengal
   2.  West Bengal                     |  Andhra Pradesh
   3.  Gujarat                         |  Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Andhra Pradesh is the largest fish producer in India, followed by West Bengal and Gujarat.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The other pairs incorrectly swap the positions of the largest fish-producing states. Accurate data on fish production by state is essential for understanding the country's overall food security and economic output.  Fisheries contribute significantly to the livelihoods of coastal communities and the national economy.


**7. Consider the following statements about dark patterns:**

   Statement                               | Correct/Incorrect
   ----------------------------------------|---------------------
   1. Dark patterns are deceptive design tactics used online to mislead customers. | Correct
   2. Dark patterns are legal under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.  | Incorrect
   3.  Dark patterns exploit human psychology.                    | Correct


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dark patterns are deceptive tactics used by online platforms to manipulate user choices for the benefit of the company. These tactics exploit cognitive biases and heuristics in human psychology to nudge users towards actions they might not otherwise take.  Statement 1 and 3 accurately describe this deceptive design practice. Statement 2 is incorrect because dark patterns are considered unethical and often fall under the category of unfair trade practices under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, making them illegal. The Act aims to protect consumer rights and prevent such manipulative practices.  Understanding dark patterns is crucial for digital literacy and consumer protection.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Hydroelectric Power Plant       |  Location/Feature
   -------------------------------|--------------------------
   1.  Three Gorges Dam            |  Largest hydropower station globally
   2.  Sidrapong                    |  Oldest hydroelectric plant in India
   3.  Tehri Dam                   |  Located in Uttarakhand


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Three Gorges Dam in China is the largest hydropower station in the world. The Sidrapong hydroelectric power plant in West Bengal is the oldest hydroelectric power plant in India.  The Tehri Dam is indeed located in Uttarakhand.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  Knowing the locations and features of significant hydroelectric power plants is important for understanding India's energy infrastructure and its potential for renewable energy generation.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Company Type/Organization      |  Minimum Capital Requirement (in Lakhs)
   --------------------------------|-------------------------------------
   1.  Nidhi Company                |  10
   2.  Scheduled Commercial Bank   |  500
   3.  Small Finance Bank           |  100


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Nidhi companies require a minimum capital of ₹10 lakh. While the exact minimum capital requirements for scheduled commercial banks and small finance banks can vary and are subject to RBI regulations, the figures provided are not accurate representations of the minimum capital requirements.  The provided figures for scheduled commercial banks and small finance banks are distractors intended to test the examinee's knowledge of the financial sector.  Accurate knowledge of minimum capital requirements is crucial for understanding the financial health and stability of different types of financial institutions.


**10. Consider the following statements about precision farming:**

   Statement                                    | Correct/Incorrect
   ---------------------------------------------|---------------------
   1. Precision farming uses information technology to optimize crop and soil management. | Correct
   2. Soft precision farming relies heavily on statistical analysis.          | Incorrect
   3. Hard precision farming utilizes GPS and remote sensing.             | Correct


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Precision farming uses information technology, such as GPS, remote sensing, and variable rate technology, to optimize inputs to crops and soil on a site-specific basis.  Statement 1 accurately describes this approach.  Soft precision farming relies on visual observation and experience, rather than sophisticated data analysis.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Hard precision farming, on the other hand, does indeed use GPS, remote sensing, and variable rate technologies for precise management.  Statement 3 is correct.  Understanding precision farming is important for sustainable agriculture and efficient resource management.  It’s a key element in modern agricultural practices.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                               |  Share in India's GDP (2023-24, approximate)
   -----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
   1.  Karnataka                        |  8.1%
   2.  Andhra Pradesh                  |  6.4%
   3.  Telangana                        |  Approximately 30%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided percentages for Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh's share in India's GDP are distractors based on Gujarat's growth from 6.4% to 8.1% between 2000-01 and 2022-23.  The actual shares of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana in India's GDP in 2023-24 are not precisely specified as individual percentages but collectively accounted for approximately 30%.  Statement 3 is also a distractor, implying an inaccurate collective share.  Understanding the relative economic performance of Indian states is crucial for regional development planning and policy-making.  The data provided highlights the complexities of such analyses.


**12. Consider the following statements:**

   Statement                                 | Correct/Incorrect
   ------------------------------------------|---------------------
   1.  Naga King Chili received a GI tag in 2006. | Incorrect
   2.  Naga King Chili is cultivated in southern India. | Incorrect
   3.  Naga King Chili holds a Guinness World Record for heat. | Correct


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Naga King Chili received a GI tag in 2008, not 2006.  It is primarily cultivated in northeastern India, specifically Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur, not in the southern states. The Naga King Chili does hold a Guinness World Record for its extreme heat, surpassing 1 million Scoville Heat Units.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.  The other statements contain incorrect information regarding the GI tag and cultivation area.  Understanding geographical indications and their significance for agricultural products is crucial for promoting regional identity and protecting unique products.


**13. Consider the following statements:**

   Statement                               | Correct/Incorrect
   ---------------------------------------|---------------------
   1.  India is the world's largest milk producer. | Correct
   2.  Operation Flood was launched in 1970.    | Correct
   3.  The White Revolution aimed at increasing fish production. | Incorrect


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India is indeed the world's largest milk producer. Operation Flood, the program responsible for the White Revolution, was launched in 1970 by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).  However, the White Revolution specifically targeted increasing milk production, not fish production.  Therefore, statements 1 and 2 are correct, while statement 3 is incorrect.  Understanding the White Revolution and its impact on India's dairy sector is important for comprehending the country's agricultural development trajectory.


**14. Consider the following statements about White Revolution 2.0:**

   Statement                                       | Correct/Incorrect
   -------------------------------------------------|---------------------
   1.  White Revolution 2.0 aims to increase milk procurement to 1000 lakh kg/day by 2029. | Correct
   2.  Margdarshika aims to establish 5 lakh new PACS, Dairy, and Fishery Cooperatives. | Incorrect
   3. White Revolution 2.0 focuses on women's empowerment. | Correct

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

White Revolution 2.0 aims to increase milk procurement to 1000 lakh kg/day by 2029. This initiative also emphasizes women's empowerment within the dairy sector.  However, the Margdarshika initiative aims to establish 2 lakh new PACS, Dairy, and Fishery Cooperatives, not 5 lakh as stated.  Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are correct, while statement 2 is incorrect.  Understanding the goals and strategies of White Revolution 2.0 is essential for evaluating India's agricultural and rural development policies.  The focus on women's empowerment highlights the evolving priorities in rural development.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax/Act/Policy                       |  Feature
   ------------------------------------|------------------------
   1.  GST                               |  Subsumed various taxes
   2.  101st Constitutional Amendment Act |  Introduced GST in 2017
   3.  GST Council                       |  Sets tax rates for petroleum products


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) subsumed various indirect taxes into a single, unified system. The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act introduced the GST in 2017. However, the GST Council does not set tax rates for petroleum products; these remain outside the GST ambit for the time being.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Pair 3 incorrectly attributes a function to the GST Council which it does not currently perform,  illustrating the dynamic nature of tax policies and their implementation.  The details of GST implementation, including its coverage and exceptions, are essential to understanding India's indirect tax system.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Slab                                     Applicable Goods/Services
1. 5%                                          :   Luxury items
2. 12%                                         :   Daily necessities
3. 18%                                         :   Sin goods
4. 28%                                         :   Demerit goods

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The provided text mentions a four-slab Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure with rates of 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.  The rationale behind the different slabs was to differentiate between essential goods and luxury or harmful products.  However, the pairings in the question are incorrect.  Daily necessities are typically taxed at the lowest rates (5% or 0%), not 12%.  Luxury items are taxed at the higher end of the spectrum (28%), not 5%. Sin goods (those considered harmful, like alcohol and tobacco) and demerit goods (those with negative externalities,  like junk food) fall under the higher tax brackets (18% and 28%), but the specific association in the question with only one tax rate for each is not accurate. The GST structure aims for a progressive taxation system, where essential goods face lower taxation, and luxury/harmful goods attract higher rates, including a cess on the highest slab. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the GST system's design and its objectives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Component                             Associated Tax
1. Cess                                       :   Goods and Services Tax (GST)
2. Surcharge                                  :   Corporate Income Tax (CIT)
3. Input Tax Credit (ITC)                       :   Central Excise Duty

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The passage explains that a cess is levied on top of the highest GST slab (28%), applicable to luxury, sin, and demerit goods. This correctly matches pair 1. The passage also mentions a surcharge levied on Corporate Income Tax (CIT). This correctly matches pair 2.  Pair 3 is incorrect. While Input Tax Credit (ITC) is a mechanism within the GST system allowing businesses to reduce their tax liability by claiming credit for taxes already paid on inputs, it is not directly associated with a single tax like Central Excise Duty.  Central Excise Duty is a predecessor to the GST. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall and analytical ability to distinguish between different tax components and their application within the Indian tax structure.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regulatory Body                           Area of Regulation
1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) :   Futures and Options (F&O) trading
2. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)              :   Priority Sector Lending (PSL)
3. Central Silk Board (CSB)                 :   Green bonds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) highlighted the risks associated with F&O trading, indicating its regulatory role in this area. This correctly matches pair 1. The passage also details that RBI (Reserve Bank of India) is responsible for the Priority Sector Lending (PSL) initiative, which matches pair 2. Pair 3 is incorrect.  While the CSB (Central Silk Board) is mentioned, its role is in the development of India's silk industry, not the regulation of green bonds.  Green bonds are regulated by SEBI.  Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the regulatory frameworks in India, testing the ability to link regulatory bodies with their specific areas of operation.  It also incorporates interdisciplinary linkage understanding by connecting financial regulations with economic policy.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

   Statement 1: China is the world's largest rice producer.
   Statement 2: India is the world's largest exporter of rice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

The passage directly states that China is the largest rice producer globally, making Statement 1 correct.  It further clarifies that India is the world's largest exporter of rice,  confirming Statement 2.  Therefore, both statements are correct. The question tests factual recall of global agricultural production and trade data. This requires knowledge beyond basic facts, demonstrating a higher level of understanding of global agricultural markets and India's role within them.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                    Subject Matter
1. Article 14                               :   Right to die with dignity
2. Article 19                               :   Safeguards for Scheduled Castes and Tribes
3. Article 21                               :   Freedom of speech and expression
4. Article 32                               :   Right to constitutional remedies
5. Article 280                              :   Composition of the Finance Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, which is correctly paired in option 4. Article 280 deals with the composition of the Finance Commission, correctly paired in option 5. The other options are incorrect. Article 14 deals with equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, not the right to die with dignity (which is interpreted under Article 21). Article 19 deals with freedom of speech and expression, among other fundamental rights; it does not relate to safeguards for Scheduled Castes and Tribes (which are covered under Articles 17, 338, and 46). Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, encompassing the right to die with dignity as interpreted by the Supreme Court, but not explicitly mentioned in the article itself.  Therefore, only options 4 and 5 are correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall of constitutional provisions and their subject matters, assessing detailed knowledge of Indian Polity.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                  Function
1. Public Accounts Committee (PAC)         :   Examines annual audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)
2. Law Commission of India                 :   Appoints members of the Lokpal
3. Selection Committee for Lokpal           :   Advises the government on matters concerning sericulture
4. Collegium System                         :   Reviews the constitutionality of laws

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The PAC examines the CAG's audit reports, making pair 1 correct. The other pairs are incorrect. The Law Commission of India provides legal advice and drafts legislation, it does not appoint Lokpal members (this is done by a selection committee). The Selection Committee for Lokpal recommends appointments to the Lokpal, not advising on sericulture (that's the Central Silk Board's role). The Collegium System is related to the appointment of judges, not the review of laws' constitutionality (that's a function of the Supreme Court). Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the functions of different governmental bodies in India, requiring knowledge of both the legislative and executive branches.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

   Statement 1: The CBI was established by the Special Police Establishment (SPE) Act of 1946.
   Statement 2: The CBI coordinates investigations on behalf of Interpol member countries.
   Statement 3: The CBI can suo moto investigate offences only in Union Territories.

How many of the statements given above are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) Only one

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While the CBI's origins are linked to the SPE, it was established in 1946 but not directly by the SPE act of that year (its powers and structure evolved over time).  Statement 2 is incorrect; the CBI is India's nodal agency for Interpol cooperation but does not coordinate investigations *on behalf of* other member countries.  Interpol facilitates international cooperation but each nation retains its own investigative process. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CBI's jurisdiction extends beyond Union Territories, although it requires consent from states for investigations within their boundaries.  Therefore, only one statement (partially correct) is accurate. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the CBI's structure, functions, and limitations, requiring nuanced understanding of its operation within both national and international contexts.  It assesses evaluation and analytical skills to assess the accuracy of the statements.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   River Basin                        Key Feature
1. Krishna River Basin                : Originates in Maharashtra
2. Godavari River Basin              : Flows through Telangana
3. Mahanadi River Basin             : Empties into Bay of Bengal
4. Cauvery River Basin                :  Originates in Karnataka
5. Brahmaputra River Basin           : Flows through Arunachal Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Krishna River originates in the Western Ghats in Maharashtra.  The Godavari River, while having its source in Maharashtra, flows through several states including Telangana before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The Mahanadi River also drains into the Bay of Bengal. The Cauvery River originates in Karnataka. The Brahmaputra River has its source in the Himalayas and flows through Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, and other states before entering Bangladesh.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  A comprehensive understanding of Indian river systems is crucial for UPSC aspirants.  This question tests the knowledge of the origin and flow of major river systems, a common theme in geography and environment-related questions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Water Dispute Tribunal             Act Under Which Established
1. Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-I : Interstate River Water Disputes Act, 1956
2. Ravi-Beas Water Disputes Tribunal :  Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956
3. Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal   :  Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956
4. Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal :  Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Interstate River Water Disputes Act, 1956, provides the legal framework for resolving water disputes between states in India.  The Krishna, Ravi-Beas, Cauvery, and Godavari water disputes tribunals were all established under this Act. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they incorrectly exclude correctly matched pairs.  Understanding the legal mechanisms for resolving inter-state water disputes is vital for UPSC preparation, particularly for questions related to governance, environmental policy, and federalism.  The question tests the knowledge of specific tribunals and the legal basis for their establishment.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Principle                      Description
1. Riparian Principles                :  Owner of land adjacent to a water body has absolute ownership of water
2. Doctrine of Absolute Liability     :  Strict liability for hazardous activities causing harm
3. Principle of Polluter Pays          :  Responsibility for environmental damage rests solely on the government
4. Public Trust Doctrine              :  Certain natural resources are held in trust for public benefit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The doctrine of absolute liability holds entities strictly liable for harm caused by hazardous activities, regardless of negligence. The public trust doctrine asserts that certain natural resources, like water bodies, are held in trust by the government for public benefit.  Pair 1 is incorrect; riparian principles grant the right to use water, not absolute ownership. Pair 3 is incorrect; the polluter pays principle places the responsibility for environmental damage on the polluter, not solely on the government.  This question tests the understanding of legal principles relevant to environmental law and resource management, a critical area for UPSC.  The carefully crafted distractors test the candidates' ability to differentiate between closely related legal concepts.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Related Judicial Appointment
1. Article 124(2)                     :  Appointment of Judges to High Courts
2. Article 217                       :  Appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court
3. Article 323A                      :  Appointment of Judges to Tribunals
4. Article 312                       :  Establishment of All India Judicial Services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Article 323A empowers Parliament to establish administrative tribunals, and the process of judicial appointment for these tribunals is indirectly linked to this article.  Article 312 enables Parliament to create an All India Judicial Service, a reform aimed at streamlining judicial appointments. Article 124(2) deals with the appointment of Supreme Court judges, not High Court judges; that's covered by Article 217. The question tests the understanding of constitutional provisions related to the Indian judicial system and its appointments, a crucial topic for UPSC. The distractors test the knowledge of specific articles and their application within the judicial context.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                  Key Provision
1. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987:  Establishes Lok Adalats
2. Mediation Act, 2023                :  Defines community mediation
3. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971       :  Specifies punishment for criminal contempt
4. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: Deals with international arbitration agreements


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, establishes Lok Adalats as alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. The Mediation Act, 2023, includes provisions for community mediation. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, outlines punishments for contempt of court.  Pair 4 is incorrect; while the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, deals with arbitration, its primary focus is not solely on international arbitration agreements.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various laws related to dispute resolution in India, testing the understanding of key provisions and their application.  The distractors test the ability to identify the precise scope of each Act.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Body                                   Jurisdiction/Function
1. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG):  Audits Public Undertakings
2. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) :  Investigates corruption cases
3. Lokpal                             :  Deals with complaints against judges
4.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):  Enforces Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The CAG audits the accounts of public undertakings as part of its function to ensure financial accountability of government bodies.  The CVC investigates corruption cases within the government. The NHRC investigates human rights violations and recommends remedial measures, but it doesn't directly enforce Fundamental Rights.  Pair 3 is incorrect; Lokpal deals with complaints against public servants, not judges.  This question tests the knowledge of key constitutional and statutory bodies in India and their respective jurisdictions, a common theme in Polity and Governance questions. The distractors test the precise understanding of each body's role and function.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                      Capital City
1. Jordan                        Amman
2. Syria                          Damascus
3. Iraq                           Baghdad
4. Palestine                     Jerusalem
5. Saudi Arabia                  Riyadh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Amman is the capital city of Jordan. Damascus is the capital city of Syria. Baghdad is the capital city of Iraq.  Jerusalem is a contested city, claimed as a capital by both Israel and Palestine, but neither internationally recognized as such. Riyadh is the capital city of Saudi Arabia. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine or incorrectly match Saudi Arabia's capital.  The question tests factual recall of capital cities in the Middle East, highlighting the complexities of geopolitical claims surrounding Jerusalem.  A thorough understanding of Middle Eastern geography and political dynamics is crucial for accurate matching.  The inclusion of Jerusalem as a distractor underscores the importance of precise knowledge in UPSC-style questions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Bordering Country
1. Jordan                        Syria

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Jordan shares a border with Syria. Israel shares a border with Lebanon. Iraq shares a border with Kuwait. Saudi Arabia shares a border with Yemen.  Option (d) is incorrect because Jordan does not share a border with Egypt.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of Middle Eastern borders, requiring precise geographical awareness. The inclusion of Egypt as a bordering country for Jordan is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's ability to identify inaccuracies based on their comprehensive knowledge of the region's political geography.  This type of question is common in the UPSC exam, emphasizing the importance of detailed factual knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Island                          Volcanic Nature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Barren Island and Narcondam Island are volcanic islands in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago.  Havelock and Neil Islands are not volcanic; they are coral islands. Long Island is also not volcanic. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the volcanic nature of the islands.  The question tests factual recall regarding the geological characteristics of specific islands within the Andaman and Nicobar group.  Understanding the geological formation of islands is crucial for comprehending their geographical features and environmental significance. The inclusion of non-volcanic islands as distractors emphasizes the need for precise knowledge in UPSC-style questions, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between various island types.


**4. With reference to La Niña, consider the following pairs:**

   Phenomenon                     Characteristic
1. Stronger Trade Winds           Increased rainfall in Southeast Asia
2. Warmer Waters towards Indonesia   Reduced rainfall in Australia
3. Below-average Rainfall          Southeast Asia experiences above-average rainfall

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

During La Niña, trade winds are stronger than usual, pushing more warm water towards the Indonesian coast. This increased warm water leads to increased rainfall in regions like Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Conversely, regions like Australia often experience below-average rainfall during La Niña events. Statement 3 is incorrect as Southeast Asia usually experiences above-average rainfall during La Niña. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the mismatching of at least one pair. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the climatic mechanisms and regional impacts of La Niña, demanding a clear grasp of its effects on different parts of the world.  The inclusion of contradictory statements highlights the importance of analytical skills and nuanced understanding of climate patterns.

   Ocean Basin                  Characteristic
1. Arabian Sea                  More cyclones than Bay of Bengal
2. Bay of Bengal                 Experiences fewer cyclones than Arabian Sea
3. Western Arabian Sea            Favourable for cyclone formation due to cooler sea temperatures

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement that the western Arabian Sea is typically favorable for cyclone formation due to cooler sea temperatures is incorrect. Cyclone formation requires warm sea surface temperatures.  The Bay of Bengal generally experiences more cyclones than the Arabian Sea. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they contain at least one mismatched pair.  The question assesses knowledge about the characteristics of cyclone formation and distribution in the North Indian Ocean.  The incorrect statements act as distractors, requiring candidates to apply their understanding of atmospheric dynamics and oceanographic factors influencing cyclone development.  This demonstrates the UPSC's focus on testing in-depth understanding and the ability to identify flawed reasoning.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                        Characteristic
1. Paraguay River               Flows through Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina
2. Paraná River                 Major tributary is the Amazon River
3. Amazon River                 Originates in the highlands of Peru
4. Congo River                  Flows through Gabon, Nigeria, and Equatorial Guinea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Amazon River originates in the Andes Mountains of Peru. The Paraguay River flows through Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. The Paraná River's major tributary is the Paraguay River, not the Amazon. The Congo River does not flow through Nigeria; it flows through the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of the Congo, and other countries. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they contain at least one mismatched pair. The question tests knowledge of major rivers and their geographical courses across South America and Africa.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to recall precise geographical details and differentiate between similar river systems. This aligns with the UPSC's emphasis on detailed geographical knowledge.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, and Pratas Islands are located in the South China Sea. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are located in the Bay of Bengal. The Canary Islands are located in the Atlantic Ocean, not the South China Sea. Option (a) is incorrect because the Canary Islands are not in the South China Sea. Option (b) is incorrect because it excludes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the Canary Islands. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of island groups and their locations, requiring accurate geographical knowledge.  The inclusion of the Canary Islands and their incorrect placement is a deliberate distractor, assessing the candidate's ability to identify and correct geographical inaccuracies.  This type of question reflects the UPSC's expectation of precise geographical awareness.

(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Arunachal Pradesh shares a border with Bhutan. Nagaland shares a border with Myanmar. Sikkim shares a border with Nepal. Manipur does not border Bangladesh; it borders Myanmar. Mizoram does not border China; it borders Myanmar and Bangladesh.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of India's international boundaries and the states that share those borders.  The incorrect pairings act as distractors, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of India's geopolitical context.  This question type is common in UPSC examinations, testing the candidate's ability to recall and apply specific geographical information.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                          Characteristic

**Explanation:**

The Amazon River originates in the Andes Mountains.  The other statements are incorrect. The Congo River does not flow through Nigeria. The Paraguay River does not flow through Bolivia. The Paraná River's major tributary is the Paraguay River, not the Amazon.  The Nile River does not flow through the Sahara Desert; it flows around it. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of at least one mismatched pair. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of major rivers and their geographical courses across different continents. The deliberate inclusion of incorrect statements tests the candidate's ability to identify geographical inaccuracies based on their comprehensive understanding of river systems and their flow patterns. This aligns with the UPSC's expectation of detailed geographical knowledge.

2. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) : Pension scheme for small and marginal farmers
3. Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) : Sustainable development of the fisheries sector
4.  Samagra Shiksha                               : Universal sanitation coverage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY) is a pension scheme for small and marginal farmers, not an affordable housing scheme. Option 1 is incorrect.  The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) indeed aims for the sustainable development of the fisheries sector. Option 2 is correctly matched. Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) provides health insurance coverage, not focusing on fisheries. Option 3 is correctly matched. Samagra Shiksha is a comprehensive education scheme, not directly related to sanitation coverage. Option 4 is incorrect. The correct pairings emphasize the importance of understanding the core objectives of major government schemes and avoiding conflating them with other initiatives.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Technology/Initiative                                 Managing Ministry
1. Graphene-Applied Program (GAP)                 : Ministry of Rural Development

4. Saarthi App                                      : Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Graphene-Applied Program (GAP) is not directly managed by the Ministry of Rural Development; its focus is on graphene technology development. Option 1 is incorrect. The India Innovation Centre for Graphene (IICG) was indeed launched by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Option 2 is correctly matched.  VisioNxt is associated with the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, focusing on fashion trend forecasting. Option 3 is correctly matched. The Saarthi App is developed by the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. Option 4 is incorrect. The correct matches showcase the need for precise knowledge about the ministries responsible for various technological initiatives and digital platforms.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Program                                  Key Feature/Goal
1. National Test House                              : Drone Certification in India (sole provider)
2. Swachh Bharat Mission                           : Universal sanitation coverage by 2019
3. AgriSURE Fund                                    : Managed by Ministry of Earth Sciences
4.  Mission Mausam                                 :  Operates under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Test House is a multidisciplinary testing laboratory involved in quality assurance for various projects, including Jal Jeevan Mission and Metro projects, but it is not the sole provider of drone certification in India. Option 1 is incorrect. The Swachh Bharat Mission did aim for universal sanitation coverage, but the target year was 2019. Option 2 is correctly matched. The AgriSURE Fund is a government initiative to boost investment in agriculture, and it is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, not the Ministry of Earth Sciences. Option 3 is incorrect. Mission Mausam is implemented by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, not the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Option 4 is incorrect.  The question highlights the need for precise understanding of government programs and their objectives.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Program/Scheme                      Key Characteristic/Implementation Detail
1. National Pension System (NPS) Vatsalya Scheme : Only for marginalized children
2. District Agro-Meteorology Units (DAMUs)      : Established under PKVY in 2018
3. Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar (PMRBP) : Awarded to children aged 5-12 years
4.  Samagra Shiksha                               : Subsumes Midday Meal Scheme

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NPS Vatsalya Scheme is open to all children, not just marginalized ones. Option 1 is incorrect. DAMUs were established by the IMD, not under PKVY in 2018. Option 2 is incorrect. PMRBP awards are given to children for exceptional abilities and achievements, and the age group is 5-18 years, not 5-12. Option 3 is partially correct, as the age group is 5-18, not 5-12 years. Samagra Shiksha subsumes SSA and RMSA, but not the Midday Meal Scheme, which is a separate program. Option 4 is incorrect.  The correct answer highlights the importance of accurate recall of specific details associated with various government programs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Ministry                Government Scheme
1. Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises :  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)
2. Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship :  PM Vishwakarma Scheme
3. Ministry of Rural Development           :  National Food Security Act (NFSA)
4. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare    :  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM Vishwakarma Scheme is indeed overseen by the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), focusing on skill development and market linkages for traditional artisans and craftspeople.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) falls under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, aiming to create a national digital health ecosystem.  Option (b) is partially correct but not fully comprehensive. Option (a) is incorrect as the PM-KISAN scheme is related to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, not MSME. Option (d) is incorrect because the National Food Security Act (NFSA) is primarily managed by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme                 Primary Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) :  Skill upgradation of traditional artisans
2. PM Vishwakarma Scheme                :  Boosting fish production and infrastructure development
3. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)       :  Creating a national digital health ecosystem
4. National Food Security Act (NFSA)       :  Ensuring food security for vulnerable populations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) accurately aims at creating a national digital health ecosystem.  The National Food Security Act (NFSA) is designed to ensure food security for vulnerable sections of the population.  Option (b) is incorrect because while the PM Vishwakarma Scheme supports skill upgradation, its primary focus isn't solely on that; it also aims at market linkages and financial assistance.  Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) focuses on improving fish production and related infrastructure.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 reflect the primary objectives correctly.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Organization          Key Responsibility Area
1. Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship :  Managing the National Food Security Act
2. Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises  :  Overseeing the PM Vishwakarma Scheme
3. Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution :  Implementing the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission
4. NITI Aayog                                  :  Developing national development plans

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) accurately oversees the PM Vishwakarma Scheme. NITI Aayog is the government body responsible for formulating national development plans. Option (a) is incorrect because the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship does not manage the National Food Security Act; that responsibility lies with the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. Option (c) is incorrect because the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution does not implement the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission; this is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Option (d) is incorrect due to the errors mentioned above. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme                     Implementing Ministry
1.  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) :  Ministry of Rural Development
2.  National Supercomputing Mission           :  Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)
3.  Jal Jeevan Mission                       :  Ministry of Jal Shakti
4.  PM Vishwakarma Scheme                   :  Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Supercomputing Mission is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), and the Jal Jeevan Mission falls under the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Option (b) is incorrect because Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is implemented by the Ministry of Finance, not the Ministry of Rural Development. Option (c) is incorrect because the PM Vishwakarma Scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), not the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. Option (d) is incorrect due to the errors mentioned above.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme               Key Feature
1.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission :  Provides financial assistance to farmers
2.  PM Vishwakarma Scheme          :  Creates a national digital health ecosystem
3.  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi:  Offers skill development and credit support to artisans
4.  National Food Security Act      :  Provides subsidized food grains to eligible beneficiaries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) creates a national digital health ecosystem.  The PM Vishwakarma Scheme offers skill development and credit support to artisans. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) provides financial assistance to farmers.  The National Food Security Act (NFSA) provides subsidized food grains to eligible beneficiaries. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of the NFSA. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly links the ABDM to providing financial assistance to farmers. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly links the ABDM to providing financial assistance to farmers.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Act                                      Key Feature/Associated Act
    1. Samagra Shiksha                              :  Subsumes Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
    2. Right to Education Act, 2009                 :  Mandates pre-school education
    3. Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar (PMRBP) :  Awarded by the Government of India
    4. National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020)   :  Basis for Samagra Shiksha implementation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Samagra Shiksha is a comprehensive scheme that subsumes several earlier education initiatives, including Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).  The Right to Education Act, 2009, mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14, and also incorporates pre-school education.  The Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar is a national award conferred by the Indian government. Finally, the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) provides the overarching framework and guidelines for the implementation of Samagra Shiksha, guiding its objectives and strategies. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the schemes and their interconnectedness.  A thorough understanding of India's education policies and national awards is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Department                     :  Function/Initiative
    1. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) :  Regulates Startups
    2. India Meteorological Department (IMD)      :  Member of World Meteorological Organization
    3. Ministry of Earth Sciences                  : Implements Mission Mausam
    4.  Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) : Collaborated with Bhashini


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate associations. The DPIIT plays a significant role in the regulation and promotion of the startup ecosystem in India.  The IMD is a member of the prestigious World Meteorological Organization, engaging in international collaborations and data sharing. The Ministry of Earth Sciences is the nodal ministry responsible for the implementation of Mission Mausam. Finally, ONDC, a digital commerce initiative, has collaborated with Bhashini, an AI-powered language translation tool, to enhance its multilingual capabilities. Options (a), (b), and (d) omit one or more of these accurate pairings, reflecting incomplete knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of these organizations and their involvement in national initiatives.  Correctly answering this question requires a strong understanding of the Indian governmental structure and its various departments and their functions.


**3. With reference to Indian Government Schemes, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Name                                  :  Primary Objective
    1. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY) :  Pension for small and marginal farmers
    2. Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) :  Health insurance for senior citizens (irrespective of income)
    3. Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) :  Pucca houses for rural households


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the primary objectives of the respective schemes. PM-KMY aims to provide a social security net for small and marginal farmers by offering a monthly pension after the age of 60.  AB PM-JAY, while initially focused on a specific income criteria, has expanded its coverage to include all senior citizens above 70 irrespective of their income.  PMAY-G focuses on providing affordable pucca houses with basic amenities to eligible rural households. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly omit one or more of these accurate associations, indicating a lack of comprehensive understanding of these crucial government welfare schemes. A clear grasp of the scope and targets of these programs is essential to answer this question correctly.  Understanding the evolution and expansion of these schemes is also important, demonstrating a deeper understanding beyond mere initial objectives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Program/Initiative                 :  Implementing Agency/Ministry
    1.  Samagra Shiksha                             : Department of School Education and Literacy
    2.  Mission Mausam                             : Ministry of Earth Sciences
    3.  Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)  : Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)
    4.  Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) : Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately link the government programs/initiatives with their respective implementing agencies/ministries.  Samagra Shiksha falls under the Department of School Education and Literacy.  Mission Mausam is implemented by the Ministry of Earth Sciences. The ONDC initiative is overseen by the DPIIT. Finally, PMMSY is under the purview of the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs, highlighting the importance of knowing which ministry or department is responsible for the implementation of specific government schemes. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the organizational structure of the Indian government and its responsibility for various initiatives.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

    1. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 is based on Article 21A of the Indian Constitution.
    2. Samagra Shiksha subsumes the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA).
    3.  The India Meteorological Department (IMD) operates the SAFAR system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The RTE Act, 2009, is indeed based on Article 21A, which guarantees the right to education to all children aged 6-14 years. Samagra Shiksha, as a comprehensive scheme, subsumes several previous education schemes, including RMSA.  And the IMD is responsible for operating and maintaining the SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) system for air quality monitoring and forecasting.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correct statement.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of constitutional provisions related to education and the functions of key government organizations.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Scheme                     Implementing Ministry
1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) : Ministry of Rural Development
2. Mission Vatsalya                        : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. PM Vishwakarma Scheme                 : Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises
4. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) : Ministry of Health & Family Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 2:** Mission Vatsalya is indeed overseen by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, focusing on child protection and welfare. This is accurately reflected in the provided information.

* **Pair 3:** The PM Vishwakarma Scheme, designed to support traditional artisans and craftspeople, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises. This aligns perfectly with the scheme's objective of boosting the MSME sector.

* **Pair 4:** The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), aiming to create a digital health infrastructure, is managed by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.  This is a core function of the health ministry, ensuring the digitalization of health records and services.

* **Pair 1:** This pairing is incorrect. While the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) aims to improve fish production, it is primarily implemented by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, not the Ministry of Rural Development. The Ministry of Rural Development focuses on rural development initiatives, whereas PMMSY is a fisheries-specific scheme.  This highlights the importance of understanding the specific mandates of different government ministries.


**2. With reference to Central Government Schemes, consider the following pairs:**

Scheme                                    Primary Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) :  Promote organic farming practices
2. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)     : Provide financial support for crop losses
3. Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY)    :  Incentivize job creation in the formal sector
4. PM-SYM Pension Yojana                   :  Provide social security to unorganized workers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Let's examine each pair:

* **Pair 2:** The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a crop insurance scheme designed to provide financial protection to farmers against crop losses due to various natural calamities. This directly addresses the objective stated in the pair.

* **Pair 3:** The Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) aims to incentivize employers to create new jobs in the formal sector, particularly post-COVID-19. The scheme achieves this by contributing to the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) for newly hired employees.

* **Pair 4:** The Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) Yojana is a pension scheme specifically for unorganized workers, providing them with social security in old age.  This aligns perfectly with the stated objective.

* **Pair 1:**  This pairing is incorrect. While PM-KISAN provides income support to farmers, its primary objective is not to promote organic farming. While organic farming might indirectly benefit from the scheme's financial assistance, it's not the central focus of PM-KISAN.  The scheme primarily aims to supplement the financial needs of landholding farmers.


**3. With reference to the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM), consider the following pairs:**

Supercomputer                      Location of Installation
1. PARAM Siddhi                       : IIT Kharagpur
2. PARAM Shakti                        : IISc Bangalore
3. PARAM Brahma                       :  Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune
4. PARAM Ananta                       :  IIT Hyderabad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  While the NSM has established many supercomputers across India, only pairs 2 and 3 reflect accurate locations.  Specific locations for PARAM-series supercomputers can vary over time as the mission progresses and new installations are made.  Therefore, verifying the current location is crucial.  The other options contain incorrect pairings of supercomputers and their installation locations. This underscores the need for precise knowledge in  UPSC-style questions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Organization              Key Responsibility Area
1. National Informatics Centre (NIC)  :  Development of PARIVESH portal
2. Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) :  Oversees the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM)
3. Department of Science and Technology (DST) : Manages the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)
4. Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying : Regulates Environmental Clearances


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a).

* **Pair 1:** The National Informatics Centre (NIC) is indeed responsible for designing, developing, and hosting the PARIVESH portal, a crucial online platform for environmental clearances.

* **Pair 2:** The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) plays a key role in steering the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM) along with the Department of Science and Technology (DST), underscoring its involvement in India's technological advancement.

* **Pair 3:** This is incorrect.  The Department of Science and Technology (DST) is involved in the NSM, but the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is overseen by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying.

* **Pair 4:** This is also incorrect.  The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying is not responsible for regulating environmental clearances.  This function falls under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).  The incorrect pairings in options (b), (c), and (d) highlight the importance of precise knowledge about the roles and responsibilities of different government organizations.


**5. With reference to Government Schemes for MSMEs, consider the following pairs:**

Scheme                                     Implementing Agency
1. PM Vishwakarma Scheme                   :  SIDBI
2. Interest Subvention Scheme for MSMEs : Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises
3. Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) : Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO)
4.  Fund of Funds for MSMEs                 : Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 3:** The Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY), aimed at boosting formal sector employment, is indeed implemented by the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), which manages provident fund contributions for employees.

* **Pair 4:** The Fund of Funds for MSMEs is a crucial initiative managed by SIDBI to provide financial assistance and support to MSMEs.  SIDBI's role in supporting MSMEs is well-established.

* **Pair 1:** This is incorrect. While SIDBI plays a significant role in financing MSMEs, the PM Vishwakarma Scheme's implementation involves multiple ministries, including the Ministry of MSME, not solely SIDBI.

* **Pair 2:** This is also incorrect.  The Interest Subvention Scheme for MSMEs is not directly implemented by the Ministry of MSME itself.  While the ministry oversees the scheme, the actual disbursement and management involve various financial institutions and banks.  The inaccurate pairings in options (a), (b), and (d) emphasize the necessity of accurate knowledge of implementing agencies for government schemes.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, focusing on factual recall and analysis while incorporating plausible distractors.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills, primarily focusing on factual recall and analysis with plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization      Headquarters City
1.  International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) :  Brussels
2.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)                 :   Paris
3.  World Trade Organization (WTO)                    :   Geneva
4.  International Monetary Fund (IMF)                  :   Washington D.C.
5.  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)    :   Montreal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only statements 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  The FATF is headquartered in Paris, the IMF in Washington D.C., and the ICAO in Montreal.  Statement 1 is incorrect; INTERPOL's headquarters is in Lyon, France, not Brussels. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the WTO's headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland.  The question uses plausible distractors by including Brussels (the headquarters of the EU), which might confuse candidates familiar with international organizations but not their precise locations.  The inclusion of Geneva (WTO) and Washington D.C. (IMF) further enhances the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge rather than general awareness.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country            Major Trade Partner
1. India               :  Pakistan
2. Bangladesh         :  China
3. Nepal               :   India
4. Sri Lanka           :  United States
5.  Myanmar           :  Thailand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a).  India and Nepal have a significant bilateral trade relationship, making statement 3 correct. While India and Pakistan have historically had a trade relationship,  the current status is complex and not consistently "major." Therefore, statement 1 is a plausible distractor, testing nuanced knowledge.  Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect.  Bangladesh's major trade partners include India, China, and others; it's not predominantly one. Similarly, Sri Lanka's major trade partners are diverse. Statement 5 is incorrect; Myanmar’s major trading partners are also diverse. The question's difficulty stems from the need for precise knowledge of current major trade relationships, which can fluctuate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative      Key Feature
1.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :   Focuses solely on road transport
2.  Quad Cancer Moonshot                         :   Led by Australia
3.  Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI) :  First workshop hosted by Japan
4.  Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) :  Headquarters in Geneva


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct as none of the pairs are entirely accurate.  IMEC utilizes multiple transport modes (rail, road, and sea), making statement 1 incorrect. The Quad Cancer Moonshot is a joint initiative, not solely led by Australia, rendering statement 2 false. MAITRI's first workshop is hosted by India, not Japan, making statement 3 incorrect.  While CDRI does focus on disaster management, its headquarters are in New Delhi, India, not Geneva, making statement 4 incorrect.  The question includes several plausible, but ultimately incorrect, options to increase difficulty and test the candidate's detailed knowledge of these initiatives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country          Membership in International Organization
1. Argentina        :  BRICS
2. Iran             :  BRICS
3. Australia         :   BRICS
4. Egypt            :   BRICS
5. Paraguay          : International Solar Alliance (ISA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer.  Iran's recent inclusion in BRICS makes statement 2 correct. Paraguay's membership in the ISA makes statement 5 correct.  Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect.  Argentina, Australia, and Egypt are not current members of BRICS. The question’s difficulty comes from the recent changes in BRICS membership, requiring up-to-date knowledge.  The inclusion of Paraguay (a less prominently discussed ISA member) further enhances the difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Lending Mechanism         Institution
1. Extended Fund Facility (EFF) :    World Bank
2. Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) :   International Monetary Fund (IMF)
3. Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) :  Asian Development Bank (ADB)
4. Flexible Credit Line (FCL)     :   International Monetary Fund (IMF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The IMF administers the RFI and FCL lending mechanisms. Statement 1 is incorrect; the EFF is an IMF mechanism, not a World Bank one. Statement 3 is incorrect; the PRGT is managed by the IMF, not the ADB. The question uses plausible distractors by including the World Bank and ADB, institutions known for development finance, which might lead candidates to incorrectly associate them with these specific IMF lending mechanisms. The question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of international financial institutions and their functions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country          Member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
1. Kuwait           :  Yes
2. Egypt            :  No
3. Qatar            :  Yes
4. Iran             :  No
5. United Arab Emirates: Yes
6.  Bahrain          : Yes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, 5, and 6 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Bahrain are all members of the GCC. Egypt and Iran are not members. The question includes Egypt and Iran as plausible distractors, testing detailed knowledge of the GCC's membership.  The inclusion of Bahrain adds another level of difficulty, requiring precise knowledge of all GCC members.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization    Mandate
1.  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) :  Regulating military and civil aviation globally
2.  International Monetary Fund (IMF)                 :   Tackling global money laundering and terrorist financing
3.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)              :    Providing loans to governments facing currency crises


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are completely accurate. The ICAO regulates international civil aviation, but its mandate does not extend to military aviation in the same comprehensive way, making statement 1 partially incorrect.  The IMF’s mandate is primarily concerned with international monetary cooperation and financial stability, not directly with money laundering and terrorist financing (statement 2 is incorrect). The FATF focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing but doesn't directly provide loans to governments (statement 3 is incorrect).  The question's difficulty lies in the subtle nuances of the mandates of these organizations, requiring a deeper understanding beyond surface-level knowledge.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country             Member of BRICS
1.  Argentina          : Yes
2.  Iran               : Yes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1,2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). Argentina, Iran, and Egypt are all members of BRICS. Australia is not a member.  The question's difficulty lies in the recent expansion of BRICS, testing the candidate's knowledge of the updated membership.

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched. The 18th G20 summit was held in New Delhi, India; the 15th BRICS summit took place in Johannesburg, South Africa; the 8th Eastern Economic Forum meeting was in Vladivostok, Russia; the 49th G7 summit was held in Hiroshima, Japan; and the 1st UNCITRAL South Asia Conference was indeed convened in Colombo, Sri Lanka.  These are all verifiable facts easily found through reputable news sources and official records of these international events.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading information in any of the pairings. The question tests factual recall of the locations of significant global summits and conferences.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Option (d) is the only option that encompasses all the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Pair 1 is incorrect; the Commonwealth Games have been held in New Delhi. Pair 4 is incorrect; the National Institute of Disaster Management is located in New Delhi. Pair 5 is incorrect; the GlobE Network is supported by the UNODC, not the World Bank. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between correct and incorrect information presented within a context related to New Delhi.  Understanding the significance of international events and organizations hosted in New Delhi is important for the UPSC exam.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Institution                      Head/Key Figure/Founder
    1.  INTACH                                    :  A. Mehdi Husain
    2.  CCRT                                     :  Jawaharlal Nehru
    3.  PFRDA                                    :  Rajiv Gandhi
    4.  National Institute of Disaster Management:  Manmohan Singh

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. A. Mehdi Husain is associated with the founding of INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage).  The other pairs are incorrect. CCRT (Central Cottage Industries Emporium) is not directly linked to a single founder figure like Jawaharlal Nehru (although he was instrumental in its development).  Similarly, PFRDA (Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority), NIDM (National Institute of Disaster Management), and NHRC (National Human Rights Commission) don't have single individuals directly attributed to their founding in the same way as INTACH.  This question tests factual knowledge about the key figures associated with important Indian organizations and institutions.  Understanding the historical context and leadership of these organizations is important for the UPSC.


**5. With reference to New Delhi's infrastructure, consider the following pairs:**

    Infrastructure Type                        Associated Government Body/Organization
    1.  Northern Railway Zone                   :  Ministry of Railways
    2.  Major Ports                              :  Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
    3.  National Waterways                       :  Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways
    4.  Airports                                  :  Ministry of Civil Aviation
    5.  Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC)     :  Ministry of Urban Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Northern Railway Zone falls under the Ministry of Railways; National Waterways under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways; and Airports under the Ministry of Civil Aviation.  Pair 2 is incorrect because the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways is responsible for major ports, not the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. Pair 5 is incorrect because while the Ministry of Urban Development plays a role, DMRC is a separate entity with its own board. The question tests the examinee's knowledge of the organizational structure of the Indian government and the allocation of responsibilities for different infrastructure projects.  This type of question is frequently found in the UPSC exam.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization/Initiative         Focus Area/Objective
    1.  Mineral Security Partnership (MSP)      :  Promoting sustainable agriculture
    2.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB):  Financing infrastructure projects

    4.  Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP)       :  Supporting Pacific Island nations
    5.  Group of Twenty (G20)                   :  Coordinating global health responses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The AIIB focuses on infrastructure financing; PBP supports Pacific Island nations; and the G20 plays a significant role in coordinating global responses to health crises.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the MSP focuses on critical mineral supply chains, not sustainable agriculture. Pair 3 is incorrect; the IMF's primary focus is on international monetary and financial issues, not maintaining international peace and security (that is the UNSC's mandate). The question assesses understanding of the objectives and functions of various international organizations and initiatives.  Knowledge of these organizations and their roles in global governance is essential for the UPSC.


These questions demonstrate the variety and difficulty level achievable within the specified format.  Remember to replace the example content with other relevant pairs from the provided text to create a comprehensive set of questions.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                      Treatment/Cure

4. Tuberculosis                               :   Bedaquiline
5. Dengue                                     :   TAK-003 Vaccine

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Gene therapy is an emerging treatment for sickle cell anemia, aiming to correct the underlying genetic defect. Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is a crucial treatment for cholera, replenishing fluids and electrolytes lost due to diarrhea.  MVA-BN (Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic) vaccine is used in the prevention and control of mpox. Bedaquiline is a key drug in the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.  TAK-003 is a dengue vaccine currently undergoing trials and showing promise.  These treatments represent significant advancements in medical science, addressing diverse infectious and genetic diseases. The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of specific treatments for these conditions, avoiding general knowledge about the diseases themselves.  Incorrect options strategically omit one or more correctly matched pairs to act as plausible distractors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetic Disorder                           Inheritance Pattern
1. Sickle Cell Anemia                         :   X-linked recessive
2. Down Syndrome                             :   Autosomal dominant
3. Hemophilia                                 :   Autosomal recessive
4. Cystic Fibrosis                            :   Trisomy 21

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Sickle cell anemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, not X-linked recessive. Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 (an extra copy of chromosome 21), not an autosomal dominant inheritance. Hemophilia A is typically X-linked recessive, and Hemophilia B is also X-linked. Cystic fibrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  The question is designed to test the candidate's understanding of the different modes of inheritance for common genetic disorders.  Incorrect options include plausible distractors by offering single pairs that are partially correct (e.g., Hemophilia being X-linked), but ultimately, none of the provided matches are entirely accurate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                   Phosphoric Acid Import Source
1. India                                      :   Morocco
2. China                                     :   Senegal
3. Brazil                                     :   Jordan
4. United States                             :   Tunisia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. India imports significant quantities of phosphoric acid from Morocco.  The other countries listed (Senegal, Jordan, and Tunisia) are also significant exporters of phosphate rock and phosphoric acid globally, but there's no definitive data to suggest they are major suppliers to China or Brazil in the same way Morocco is to India. The specific import-export relationships between countries can fluctuate based on various economic and geopolitical factors. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific international trade patterns and highlights the complexity of global commodity markets.  The incorrect options create plausible distractors by including countries known for their phosphate production, making it challenging to eliminate them without detailed knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Planet                                     Characteristic
1. Venus                                      :   Coldest planet
2. Mars                                       :   Presence of liquid water (past)
3. Jupiter                                    :   Largest planet
4. Earth                                      :   Highest surface gravity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Mars is known to have had liquid water on its surface in the past, although it is currently mostly frozen. Jupiter is indeed the largest planet in our solar system. Venus is the hottest planet, not the coldest.  Earth does not have the highest surface gravity in the solar system; Jupiter does. The question aims to test factual knowledge about planetary characteristics.  The distractors (incorrect pairs) are designed to be plausible given common misconceptions about planets or by using characteristics that are somewhat true but not the most accurate or significant for the planet in question.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                                    Causative Agent
1. Sickle Cell Anemia                         :   Plasmodium falciparum
2. Cholera                                     :   Vibrio cholerae
3. Mpox                                       :   Monkeypox virus
4. Tuberculosis                               :   Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Cholera is caused by *Vibrio cholerae*, mpox by the monkeypox virus, and tuberculosis by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  However, pair 1 is incorrect. Sickle cell anemia is not caused by a pathogen; it's a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene. The question tests understanding of the causative agents of different diseases. The distractor (incorrect pair) uses a pathogen, *Plasmodium falciparum* (which causes malaria), to create a plausible yet incorrect association with a genetic disorder.  The other options strategically omit correctly matched pairs to increase the difficulty.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                  Application
1. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing                :   Treating cystic fibrosis
2. CAR T-cell therapy                        :   Treating leukemia
3. Gene drive technology                     :   Eradicating malaria

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is a powerful tool with applications in treating various genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy used to treat certain cancers, including leukemia. Gene drive technology, while still under development, has the potential to eradicate vector-borne diseases like malaria.  Fetal hemoglobin can alleviate symptoms of thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders.  This question tests knowledge of advanced biotechnological applications. The options are structured to test detailed knowledge, making simple elimination strategies less effective.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Micronutrient                               Source
1. Vitamin B12                               :   Meat and dairy products
2. Vitamin C                                  :   Citrus fruits
3. Iron                                      :   Leafy green vegetables
4. Calcium                                   :   Dairy products

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products like meat and dairy. Vitamin C is abundant in citrus fruits and other fruits and vegetables. Iron is present in leafy green vegetables and other foods. Calcium is a key component of dairy products. This question tests knowledge of nutrition and food sources of essential micronutrients. The options are designed to be challenging by including all four correct matches, making it difficult to guess the answer without thorough knowledge.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Renewable Energy Source                    Application

4. Convention on Migratory Species   :   Protection of Amur Falcons
5. Vienna Convention                   :   Regulation of Ozone-Depleting Substances


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the knowledge of different international organizations and treaties concerning environmental conservation. The IUCN is indeed responsible for the first global freshwater fish assessment. The Montreal Protocol focuses on phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol specifically targets the phase-down of HFCs. The Paris Agreement is a framework for climate action, and India has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) protects various migratory species, including the Amur Falcon. The Vienna Convention serves as the framework for the Montreal Protocol, addressing ozone-depleting substances.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they wrongly associate certain organizations/treaties with actions or focuses.  Option (c) accurately reflects the primary mandates and actions of the given organizations and treaties, indicating a strong understanding of global environmental governance.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of the geographical locations of various protected areas in India. Hemis National Park is correctly located in Ladakh. Khangchendzonga National Park is accurately situated in Sikkim. Kuno National Park is in Madhya Pradesh, not Kerala. Mathikettan Shola National Park is in Kerala, not Assam. Barak Bhuban Wildlife Sanctuary is in Assam, not Madhya Pradesh. Option (a) is correct because it includes only the correctly matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair, demonstrating a lack of precise geographical knowledge about these Indian protected areas.  The correct option highlights the importance of accurate location identification for understanding conservation efforts.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Biofuel                      Example
1. Biodiesel                           :   Ethanol
2. First-generation biofuel           :   Biodiesel
3. Renewable fuel                       :   Biobutanol
4. Cleaner-burning diesel replacement :   Biodiesel
5. Made from plant materials           :   Biodiesel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge about different types of biofuels. Biodiesel is a type of biofuel produced from renewable sources like vegetable oils and animal fats.  Therefore, the pairing of biodiesel with "cleaner-burning diesel replacement" and "made from plant materials" is correct.  First-generation biofuels include biodiesel and ethanol, so the pairing of "first-generation biofuel" with "biodiesel" is also correct. Biobutanol is a renewable fuel produced from biomass.  Ethanol is a first-generation biofuel, but it is not a biodiesel. Option (a) accurately pairs the different types of biofuels with their characteristics. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive knowledge of biofuel types and their properties.  The correct option emphasizes the need for precise understanding of biofuel classifications.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    State                                 Invasive Species Banned/Controlled
1. Gujarat                               :   Conocarpus
2. Telangana                            :   Conocarpus
3. Tamil Nadu                            :   Ludwigia peruviana
4. Manipur                               :   Amur Falcon (hunting banned)
5. Andhra Pradesh                        :   Red fire ant


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question examines the actions taken by different Indian states to control invasive species.  The Gujarat and Telangana governments have both banned the Conocarpus mangrove species due to its invasive nature. Tamil Nadu has taken steps to control the spread of Ludwigia peruviana because of its impact on elephant habitats. Manipur has imposed a ban on hunting Amur Falcons, protecting this migratory bird species.  The Red fire ant's introduction and impact in Andhra Pradesh are mentioned, but a state-level ban is not explicitly stated. Option (c) correctly identifies the states and their actions related to invasive species control. Options (a), (b), and (d) are partially or completely incorrect, indicating a lack of precision in recalling specific state-level actions regarding invasive species. The correct option illustrates the importance of understanding regional conservation initiatives.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Commons are resources shared by a community.
2.  Forests, ponds, grazing lands, and rivers are examples of Commons.
3.  International agreements govern the use of all Commons.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question tests an understanding of the concept of "Commons" in resource management. Statement 1 correctly defines Commons as resources collectively owned and managed by a community, distinguishing them from privately or governmentally owned resources. Statement 2 accurately provides examples of Commons, highlighting the diverse range of resources that fall under this category.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While international agreements exist for some global Commons like the polar regions and outer space, many other Commons are managed at local or national levels.  Therefore, option (a) is the only correct answer, showcasing an accurate understanding of the concept of Commons and the limitations of international governance in this area.  The incorrect options demonstrate potential misconceptions about the scope and management of Commons.


**9. Consider the following statements about India's climate commitments:**

1.  India aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.
2.  India plans to increase renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030.
3.  India targets reducing its cumulative emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of India's climate change commitments.  All three statements accurately reflect India's pledges and targets under the Paris Agreement and its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS).  India has officially committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.  The target of increasing renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 is a key component of India's strategy for reducing its carbon footprint. The goal of reducing cumulative emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030 is another significant aspect of India's climate action plan.  All three statements are correct, demonstrating a strong understanding of India's climate policies and international commitments.  Incorrect options show potential gaps in knowledge about the details of India's climate targets.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Convention/Protocol              Key Provision/Focus
1. Vienna Convention                 :   Phase-down of HFCs
2. Montreal Protocol                 :   Regulation of ODS
3. Kigali Amendment                  :   Protection of the ozone layer
4.  Paris Agreement                   :  Climate Change Mitigation
5.  UN Convention on the Law of the Sea : High Seas Protection


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of environmental treaties and their provisions. The Montreal Protocol is correctly paired with its focus on regulating ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The Paris Agreement correctly addresses climate change mitigation. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides the legal framework for managing activities on the high seas. The Vienna Convention provides a framework for international cooperation on the protection of the ozone layer, but the phase-down of HFCs is a key provision of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, not the Vienna Convention itself. The Kigali Amendment is part of the Montreal Protocol, and its purpose is to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), not directly to protect the ozone layer (though it contributes to it). Option (a) correctly identifies the matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies reflecting potential misconceptions about the specific provisions and focuses of these international agreements.  The correct option emphasizes the need for detailed knowledge of these agreements.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                     Publishing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                 :    World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
2. Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI)     :    World Economic Forum (WEF)
3. Agritech Report                                 :    Cornell University
4. Energy Transition Index (ETI)                   :    INSEAD Business School


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Economic Forum (WEF) publishes the Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI), a biennial report assessing the travel and tourism competitiveness of countries.  Option 2 is correctly matched.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not WIPO. WIPO publishes the Global Innovation Index (GII).  Cornell University and INSEAD Business School co-publish the Global Innovation Index (GII) along with WIPO, not the Agritech Report or the Energy Transition Index.  Therefore, options 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Activity/Publication
1. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) :   Administers patents related to energy transition
2. Cornell University                               :   Publishes the Energy Transition Index (ETI)
3. INSEAD Business School                         :   Regulates patents related to medical technology
4. World Economic Forum (WEF)                    :   Publishes the Global Innovation Index (GII)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Economic Forum (WEF) does *not* publish the Global Innovation Index (GII). The GII is co-published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Cornell University, and INSEAD.  Therefore, option 4 is the only correctly matched pair.  WIPO's activities are broader than just administering patents related to energy transition;  Cornell and INSEAD are not solely involved in publishing the ETI; and INSEAD does not regulate patents.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Agreement                 Organization Involved
1. TRIPS Agreement                               :    Cornell University
2. Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge:  INSEAD Business School
3. Riyadh Design Law Treaty (DLT)                :    World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
4.  Assam Accord                                  : World Economic Forum (WEF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option 3 is correctly matched. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) adopted the Riyadh Design Law Treaty (DLT).  The TRIPS Agreement is associated with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and WIPO, not Cornell University. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge is related to WIPO, not INSEAD. The Assam Accord is an Indian domestic agreement, unrelated to the WEF.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Ruling/Action                        Legal Concept/Area
1. Legalization of Passive Euthanasia               :   Right to Education
2.  Interpretation of Fundamental Rights             :   Environmental Protection
3.  Judicial Review of Government Actions           :   Right to Privacy
4.  Invalidation of the 99th Constitutional Amendment:   Appointment of Judges


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Supreme Court of India exercises judicial review over government actions, and its invalidation of the 99th Constitutional Amendment (relating to the NJAC) directly impacted the process of appointing judges.  The legalization of passive euthanasia was linked to the right to life and dignity, not the right to education. The interpretation of fundamental rights by the Supreme Court encompasses various areas, not just environmental protection.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Committee                           Focus/Area of Work
1. Santhanam Committee                             :   Banking Reforms
2. Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS)          :   Tax Reforms in India
3. National Instructional Media Institute (NIMI)    :   Development of Instructional Materials
4.  National Florence Nightingale Awards              : Women's Safety at Workplace


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option 3 is correctly matched.  The National Instructional Media Institute (NIMI) focuses on developing instructional materials, e-content, and question banks. The Santhanam Committee dealt with the prevention of corruption. The Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS) deals with statistical matters, not tax reforms. The National Florence Nightingale Awards recognize meritorious services by nurses, not women's safety at the workplace.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

   Index/Report                                     Top-ranked Country/Entity in 2024 (as per the text)

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Madhya Pradesh is known for its significant soya bean production, and Rajasthan has a notable Indian wolf population.  The provided text does not explicitly state that Uttar Pradesh is known for strawberry cultivation, although it mentions the possibility of its cultivation in Rajasthan.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                      Function/Responsibility
1. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) :  Oversees functioning of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF)
2. Lokpal                             : Investigates allegations of corruption against public servants
3. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):  Promotes integrity and accountability in the public sector
4. Ministry of Home Affairs           : Supervises State Vigilance Commissions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is the apex anti-corruption body in India, tasked with overseeing and ensuring the proper functioning of various government departments and public sector undertakings.  It investigates allegations of corruption and malpractices but doesn't directly supervise the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF); that falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The Lokpal is an anti-corruption ombudsman dealing with complaints against central government officials, including investigating allegations of corruption.  However, its primary focus is on investigating complaints at a higher level than the CVC's day-to-day oversight. The CBI is primarily an investigative agency.  The Ministry of Home Affairs oversees the CAPFs and also has a supervisory role over State Vigilance Commissions.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly attribute functions to organizations.  The distractors are designed to be plausible based on the general understanding of the roles of these organizations in governance and anti-corruption efforts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                         Area of Focus
1. Santhanam Committee                : Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Soybeans
2. States Reorganisation Commission : Establishment of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)
3. Justice J.S. Verma Committee       :  Prevention of Corruption


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Santhanam Committee, officially known as the Committee on Prevention of Corruption, was set up to address issues of corruption in India. Its recommendations led to the establishment of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). The States Reorganisation Commission dealt with redrawing state boundaries based on linguistic and administrative considerations. The Justice J.S. Verma Committee was established to review the criminal justice system's response to sexual assault cases. Only the statement regarding the Santhanam Committee and its focus on corruption is correctly matched. The distractors are carefully chosen to represent areas of government policy and committees that are related but not directly connected to the correct pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                  Designated Authority
1.  Right to Information Act, 2005     :  Central Information Commission (CIC)
2.  The Citizenship (Amendment) Act   :  Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)
3.  Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003:  Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Right to Information Act, 2005, designates the Central Information Commission (CIC) as the appellate authority for information requests. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act deals with citizenship matters and is not connected to the CVC. The FRBM Act, related to fiscal management, doesn't directly involve the DoPT.  Only the pairing of the RTI Act and the CIC is accurately matched.  The other options include plausible distractors that involve relevant legislation and governmental bodies, but they are not correctly linked in the given pairings. The question tests factual recall and the understanding of the roles of different governmental bodies in India.


**4. With reference to the Indian Government's initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                 Implementing Ministry

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi is a government initiative aimed at capacity building for civil servants, implemented by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. The Study in India Programme aims to attract international students and is managed by the Ministry of Education. The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana focuses on skill development and is under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The distractors are designed to be plausible by using closely related ministries and schemes, testing the examinee's knowledge of government schemes and their implementing ministries.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Award                                     Awarding Body

2.  Ramon Magsaysay Award               : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3.  Indira Gandhi Peace Prize            : Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Florence Nightingale Awards are conferred by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to recognize meritorious services rendered by nurses. The Ramon Magsaysay Award is given by the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation for outstanding contributions to Asian society. The Indira Gandhi Peace Prize is awarded by the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust. Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The distractors are designed to confuse the candidate by mixing up awards and awarding bodies, testing their knowledge of Indian and international awards and their respective institutions.


**6. With reference to Government Acts and their key features, consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                     Key Provision/Feature
1.  Right to Information Act, 2005       :  Exemption for intelligence and security organizations
2. Information Technology Act, 2000    :  Regulation of online gaming intermediaries
3.  Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964:  Acceptance of awards by government servants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Right to Information Act, 2005, includes exemptions for certain information, including that held by intelligence and security organizations. The Information Technology Act, 2000, provides the legal framework for regulating online platforms, including online gaming intermediaries.  The Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964, govern the conduct of government employees, including the acceptance of awards. All three pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of key features of important legislation and their application in the Indian context.  The option choices are designed to test the candidate's comprehension and ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Language                         Scheduled in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution (as of a specific date)
1. Kui Language                      : Yes, as of the year 1992
2.  Dogri Language                    : Yes, as of the year 2003
3.  Konkani Language                  : Yes, as of the year 1967


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Kui is a Dravidian language spoken primarily in Odisha and is not currently included in the 8th schedule. Dogri was added to the 8th schedule in 2003 through the 92nd Amendment Act. Konkani was added in 1992. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of Indian languages and the evolution of the 8th schedule of the Constitution.  The dates are strategically incorrect to increase the difficulty level.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                  Objective

Maulana Abul Kalam Azad's political biography, "India Wins Freedom," is a well-known and widely studied text on the Indian independence movement.  The Autobiography of a Delinquent was written by Kazi Nazrul Islam, not Raja Ravi Varma, who was a prominent painter.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Pairs 2 and 3 incorrectly attribute authorship to the wrong individuals, showcasing plausible but ultimately incorrect connections.

Rukmini Lakshmipathi's participation in the Salt Satyagraha and her distinction as the first female prisoner in that movement are well-documented facts.  Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion, not the Tebhaga Movement. The Tebhaga movement was primarily a peasant movement in Bengal. The question assesses factual recall related to lesser-known freedom fighters and their specific contributions to the Indian independence movement, requiring a nuanced understanding of different regional movements.  The incorrect pairings provide strong distractors, testing the candidate's ability to accurately associate individuals with their specific actions within the broader context of the freedom struggle.

The incorrect pairings are strategically designed to include related but ultimately inaccurate information, thereby increasing the difficulty level.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kartar Singh Sarabha was associated with the Ghadar Movement, not the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Bhagat Singh was a prominent revolutionary leader, but he did not found the Bombay Presidency Association (Pherozeshah Mehta is associated with it). Jawaharlal Nehru was a key figure in the Indian National Congress and the independence movement, but he was not directly associated with the Ghadar Movement.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the Indian freedom struggle, requiring the candidate to differentiate between various personalities and their roles.

Rani Lakshmibai was the queen of Jhansi, a fact widely known.  This question tests knowledge about historical figures and their respective contributions, requiring accurate recall of their roles and achievements. The incorrect pairings use plausible but incorrect associations to increase the difficulty.  The question demands precise historical knowledge and the ability to distinguish between different individuals and their accomplishments.

While Mahatma Gandhi was influential in the Bardoli Satyagraha, it was primarily led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

This question evaluates the candidate's knowledge of important literary works and their authors, requiring accurate recall of specific titles and their creators.


**5. With reference to the Indian National Congress, consider the following pairs:**

   President                      Year of Presidency

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Sarojini Naidu and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad did preside over the Indian National Congress, the years mentioned are incorrect. Sarojini Naidu was the first woman president of the INC in 1925 and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was the president in 1940.  Dadabhai Naoroji was the president of the INC in 1886. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly state the years of presidency for at least one of the persons. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian National Congress presidents and the years they held office, demanding precise chronological recall.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

All three pairs correctly match the temple/monument with its notable architectural feature or technique. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of Indian architecture, requiring knowledge of specific structural techniques and design elements.

Nana Jagannath Shankarseth founded the Native School of Bombay, which later became Elphinstone College, showcasing his contribution to education. Ayyavaikunda Swamikal introduced the Thottu Namam, a practice that challenged caste-based discrimination in temple entry.  All three pairs correctly link the person to their significant contribution.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

P.V. Narasimha Rao received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. Ravi Kannan was a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award.  However, Jon Fosse received the Nobel Prize in Literature, not the Sahitya Akademi Award. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

This question tests the candidate's awareness of prominent awards and their recipients, requiring accurate knowledge of specific awards and individuals.

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Sikh history and the actions of significant Sikh Gurus, demanding accurate recall of events and locations.

This question evaluates the candidate's understanding of Indian political history, specifically focusing on key figures and their involvement in different political groups and movements.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the facts and figures related to the individuals and events mentioned.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Title/Association
1.  Raja Raja Chola I          :   Pandya-kulasani
2.  Lachit Borphukan         :   National Defence Academy Gold Medal
3.  Rani Lakshmibai           :   Doctrine of Lapse
4.  Acharya Vinoba Bhave     :   Bharat Ratna

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Raja Raja Chola I was indeed adorned with the title "Pandya-kulasani," among others, signifying his dominance over the Pandya dynasty.  Lachit Borphukan's legacy is commemorated through the Lachit Barphukan Gold Medal awarded to the best cadet at the National Defence Academy. Rani Lakshmibai's conflict with the British stemmed directly from the application of the Doctrine of Lapse to her kingdom.  Finally, Acharya Vinoba Bhave was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1983.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to link historical figures with their significant achievements and titles.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring the candidate to possess precise knowledge to eliminate them.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Religious Figure             Significant Teaching/Movement
1.  Guru Nanak                 :   Bhoodan Movement
2.  Dadu Dayal                 :   Nirguna School
3.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati :   Integral Yoga

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Guru Nanak is the founder of Sikhism and his teachings are central to the religion, the Bhoodan Movement is associated with Acharya Vinoba Bhave.  Dadu Dayal, a prominent figure in the Nirguna school of Bhakti, correctly pairs with this philosophical tradition.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj, not Integral Yoga, which is associated with Sri Aurobindo. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's ability to connect religious figures with their specific beliefs and movements, highlighting the differences between closely related concepts.  The inclusion of Integral Yoga as a distractor tests knowledge beyond the primary focus on the Nirguna school.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Birthplace
1.  Rani Lakshmibai           :   Talwandi
2.  Kartar Singh Sarabha      :   Varanasi
3.  Acharya Vinoba Bhave     :   Ulihatu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Rani Lakshmibai was born in Varanasi, not Talwandi (which is Guru Nanak's birthplace). Kartar Singh Sarabha was not born in Varanasi; his birthplace is not explicitly mentioned in the text.  Acharya Vinoba Bhave's birthplace, Ulihatu, is correctly stated.  Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the birthplaces of significant historical figures, introducing plausible distractors to increase the difficulty level.  The options are designed to make the elimination process challenging, requiring precise knowledge to arrive at the correct answer.



**4.  With reference to the Indian Freedom Struggle, consider the following pairs:**

   Revolutionary/Leader          Significant Movement/Association

2.  Alluri Sitarama Raju       :   Manyam Rebellion
3.  Kartar Singh Sarabha       :   Servants of People Society


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lala Lajpat Rai's association with the Ghadar Movement is not directly mentioned in the provided text, but he was a prominent figure in the Indian freedom struggle. Alluri Sitarama Raju is correctly associated with the Manyam Rebellion (also known as the Rampa Rebellion).  Kartar Singh Sarabha was a key member of the Ghadar Party, not associated with the Servants of People Society (founded by Lala Lajpat Rai). Therefore, only pairs 2 is clearly and definitively correct. The other options are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the Indian freedom struggle, using plausible distractors to increase difficulty.  The candidate needs precise knowledge to avoid being misled by the close relationships between some of the figures and events.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                      Founder/Key Figure
1.  Arya Samaj                       :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale
2.  Servants of India Society         :   Swami Dayanand Saraswati
3.  Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College:   Sir Syed Ahmed Khan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Arya Samaj was founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, not Gopal Krishna Gokhale.  The Servants of India Society was founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, not Swami Dayanand Saraswati. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan is correctly identified as the founder of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of the founders of important organizations, using incorrect but plausible distractors to challenge the candidate's understanding.  The question requires precise knowledge to distinguish between closely related historical figures.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Award                     Recipient Mentioned in Text

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kazi Nazrul Islam was awarded the Padma Bhushan. Acharya Vinoba Bhave received the Bharat Ratna posthumously. Raja Ravi Varma was awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal.  All three pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of awards and their recipients, incorporating plausible distractors that require specific knowledge to eliminate. The question's difficulty stems from the need for precise recall of awards and recipients.


**7. With reference to the religious and social reform movements in India, consider the following pairs:**

3.  Suddha Sanmarga Sangam:  Rejection of idolatry and ritualistic worship


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The slogan "One Caste, One Religion, One God" is associated with Sree Narayana Guru and Ayyavazhi. The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, is correctly linked to the rejection of idolatry and ritualistic worship and the emphasis on Vedic principles. Suddha Sanmarga Sangam is the key idea of Shri Ramalinga Swamigal's philosophy, not a slogan.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of different reform movements and their core tenets, utilizing carefully selected distractors to challenge the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar concepts and slogans.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Location                    Event/Historical Figure
1.  Lahore                       :   Raja Raja Chola I

Raja Raja Chola I is associated with Thanjavur, not Lahore. Guru Nanak's birthplace, Talwandi, is correctly paired. Birsa Munda's birthplace, Ulihatu, is also correctly matched.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of locations associated with important historical figures and events.  The inclusion of Lahore as a distractor requires precise knowledge to avoid being misled.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Book/Writing             Author
1.  Satyartha Prakash         :   Sri Aurobindo Ghosh
2.  Essays on the Gita       :   Swami Dayanand Saraswati
3.  Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind :   Sir Syed Ahmed Khan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Satyartha Prakash was authored by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, not Sri Aurobindo Ghosh. Essays on the Gita was written by Sri Aurobindo Ghosh, not Swami Dayanand Saraswati.  Sir Syed Ahmed Khan authored Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of literary works and their authors, using carefully constructed distractors to increase the difficulty level.  The candidate needs precise knowledge to avoid being misled by the close relationships between some of the authors and their works.  The question demands  accurate recall.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    State/Region          Prominent Tribe
1.  Tripura                  :   Juangs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Juangs are primarily found in Odisha, not Tripura. The Reangs are predominantly in Tripura, not Odisha.  The Khonds are found in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, not Assam. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of tribal distribution across different states, using carefully chosen distractors. The candidate needs to possess accurate knowledge to answer correctly.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test various cognitive skills, including factual recall, analysis, and evaluation.  Note that the questions do not explicitly refer to the provided text as their source.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                     Capital City
1.  Tripura                       :   Imphal
2.  Maharashtra                  :   Mumbai
3.  Kerala                         :   Thiruvananthapuram
4.  Gujarat                        :   Gandhinagar

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only Maharashtra's capital is Mumbai and Gujarat's capital is Gandhinagar. Imphal is the capital of Manipur, not Tripura.  Vijayawada is a major city in Andhra Pradesh, not the capital of Telangana; Hyderabad is Telangana's capital. Thiruvananthapuram is indeed the capital of Kerala. The question includes plausible distractors by using incorrect capital cities and closely related but incorrect state-capital pairings.  This necessitates careful factual recall and analytical skills to arrive at the correct answer.  Understanding the geographical distribution of Indian states and their capitals is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Social Reformer/Activist        Significant Contribution/Work
1.  Jyotiba Phule                   :   Founded the Arya Samaj
2.  Savitribai Phule                :   Authored 'Gulamgiri'

(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Sree Narayana Guru is correctly paired with his significant contribution of propagating the idea of 'One Caste, One Religion, One God,' reflecting his social reform ideology. Similarly, Raja Ram Mohan Roy is accurately linked to the establishment of the Brahmo Samaj.  The other options are incorrect because Jyotiba Phule did not found the Arya Samaj (Dayanand Saraswati did), and Savitribai Phule did not author 'Gulamgiri' (Jyotiba Phule did). This question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant social reformers and their contributions to Indian society, a crucial area for the UPSC exam. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related figures and their actions.



**3. With reference to Indian tribal groups, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State Primarily Located In
1.  Reang                            :   Mizoram
2.  Koraga                           :   Odisha
3.  Siddi                            :   Gujarat
4.  Bru (Reang)                       :   Tripura

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only


**Explanation:**

The Siddi community is correctly paired with Gujarat, reflecting their significant presence in that state.  The Bru (Reang) tribe is correctly associated with Tripura. The other options are incorrect. While Reang are found in Tripura, they are not primarily located in Mizoram.  The Koraga tribe is primarily found in Karnataka and Kerala, not Odisha.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of various tribal groups across India, a key aspect of Indian diversity often tested in the UPSC.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings serves as a strong distractor, demanding careful analysis of the facts.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Personality                         Significant Contribution/Association
1.  Birsa Munda                       :   Led the Rampa Rebellion
2.  Alluri Sitarama Raju             :   Led the Ulgulan movement

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Alluri Sitarama Raju is correctly paired with his leadership of the Rampa Rebellion.  Rabindranath Tagore is accurately linked to the composition of 'Amar Sonar Bangla,' the national anthem of Bangladesh. The other options are incorrect. Birsa Munda led the Ulgulan movement, not the Rampa Rebellion.  Kazi Nazrul Islam did not author 'Gulamgiri' (Jyotiba Phule did). This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of prominent figures in Indian history and their contributions, demanding both factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar historical events and individuals. The distractors are carefully chosen to challenge the candidate’s understanding of Indian history and culture.


**5. With reference to significant literary awards in India, consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Sangeet Natak Akademi Amrit Awards are correctly matched with the Sangeet Natak Akademi, which is the awarding body.  The other options are incorrect. The Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded by the Swedish Academy, not the Sahitya Akademi.  The Sahitya Akademi Award is given by the Sahitya Akademi, not the Swedish Academy. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various literary awards and their respective governing bodies, an important aspect of cultural understanding for the UPSC.  The distractors effectively test the ability to distinguish between similar-sounding awards and their origins.

(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Alluri Sitarama Raju was influenced by the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Bhagat Singh's involvement in the Kakori Conspiracy is well-documented. Malati Mem's participation in the anti-opium campaign in Assam is also a known fact. However, Ashfaqulla Khan's primary association is with the Kakori Conspiracy and the Hindustan Republican Association, not the Quit India Movement. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures in the Indian independence movement and their involvement in specific events.  The distractor involving Ashfaqulla Khan and the Quit India Movement requires careful evaluation of historical facts.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person/Organization           Award Received
1.  Jon Fosse                     :   Ramon Magsaysay Award
2.  Ravi Kannan                   :   Nobel Prize in Literature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Jayant Vishnu Narlikar is correctly paired with the Govind Swarup Lifetime Achievement Award.  The other options are incorrect. Jon Fosse received the Nobel Prize in Literature, not the Ramon Magsaysay Award.  Ravi Kannan received the Ramon Magsaysay Award, not the Nobel Prize in Literature. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of award recipients, requiring precise recall of names and the awards they received. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar individuals and awards, demanding careful evaluation of the facts.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                     Major Language Spoken
1.  Tripura                       :   Bengali

(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Maharashtra's major language is Marathi, Gujarat's is Gujarati, and Telangana's is Telugu.  The other options are incorrect.  While Bengali is spoken in Tripura, it is not the major language; Kokborok is. Tamil is the major language of Tamil Nadu, not Kerala; Malayalam is. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the major languages spoken in different Indian states, demanding precise factual recall.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to identify the primary language in each state, demanding careful analysis of linguistic diversity in India.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Festival                           State/Region
1.  Ambubachi Mela                   :   Kerala
2.  Pushkaralu Festival               :   Uttar Pradesh
3.  Kati Bihu                         :   Assam
4.  Hornbill Festival                  :   Nagaland
5.  Raja Parba                        :   West Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Kati Bihu is correctly associated with Assam, and the Hornbill Festival is correctly linked to Nagaland. The other options are incorrect. Ambubachi Mela is celebrated in Assam, not Kerala. Pushkaralu is a festival associated with Telugu-speaking regions, primarily Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, not Uttar Pradesh.  Raja Parba is celebrated in Odisha, not West Bengal. This question tests the candidate's awareness of various Indian festivals and their geographical locations, demanding accurate factual recall.  The distractors effectively challenge the candidate's knowledge of the specific states/regions where these festivals are prominently celebrated.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Entity/Feature
1. Companies Act, 2013                         :  Defines criteria for Accredited Investors
2. Consumer Protection Act, 2019               :  Establishes the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA)
3. Pension Fund (Amendment) Regulations 2023 :  Governs the National Pension System (NPS)
4.  Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985             :  Underpins the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) policy
5.  Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976              :  Regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Companies Act, 2013, indeed sets the criteria for identifying and regulating Accredited Investors, who are permitted to invest in certain financial instruments not available to the general public.  Option (a) is therefore partially correct but incomplete.  The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, explicitly establishes the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to protect consumer rights and enforce regulations, making option (b) partially correct.  The Pension Fund (Amendment) Regulations, 2023, are directly related to the governance and regulation of the National Pension System (NPS), but the statement is not a perfect match as the Regulations amend, rather than solely govern, the NPS. The Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985, provides the legal basis for the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) policy, regulating the pricing and distribution of fertilizers. Finally, the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976, establishes Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) acts as their regulator and supervisor.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, 4, and 5 represent accurate pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Function/Characteristic
1. National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) : Monitors and enforces accounting standards for all companies registered in India.
2. Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) : Conducts investigations into violations of consumer rights.
3.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)   : Issue cheques drawn on themselves.
4.  Asian Development Bank (ADB)              : Headquartered in Shanghai, China.
5. International Solar Alliance (ISA)           : Focuses on renewable energy.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NFRA is responsible for overseeing the quality of corporate financial reporting in India, but its scope is not limited to *all* companies; it focuses on listed companies and large unlisted companies.  The CCPA indeed investigates consumer rights violations. NBFCs do *not* issue cheques drawn on themselves; this is a function of banks.  The ADB is headquartered in Manila, Philippines, not Shanghai. The ISA's primary focus is on solar energy, a form of renewable energy. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                             Characteristic
1. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                     : Tracks changes in prices paid by producers.
2. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)                   : Measures retail inflation.
3.  Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)             : Provides direct ownership of company assets.
4.  Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC)                  : A fiscal policy tool.
5.  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)           : Includes fertilizers, cement, and crude oil.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CPI tracks changes in prices paid by *consumers*, not producers. The WPI measures *wholesale* inflation, not retail inflation. FPI does *not* provide direct ownership; it represents indirect investment in securities. The NBC is indeed a fiscal policy tool used to manage state government borrowing. The ICI comprises eight core industries, including fertilizers, cement, and crude oil. Thus, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Concept                           Application/Feature
1. Blockchain technology                        : Centralized ledger system.
2. Cryptocurrencies                             : Operate on decentralized networks using blockchain.
3.  Geographical Indication (GI) tag             : Valid for 5 years.
4.  Agrivoltaic farming                          : Combines agriculture with solar energy generation.
5.  Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) policy          : Fixes the MRP of urea.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Blockchain technology is a *decentralized* ledger system. Cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology for decentralized operation.  GI tags are valid for 10 years, renewable. Agrivoltaic farming combines agriculture and solar energy. The NBS policy does *not* fix the MRP of urea; urea's MRP is government-fixed, while NBS applies to other fertilizers. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/Region                                  Characteristic/Feature
1. Assam                                         : Largest tea producer in India.
2. Tamil Nadu                                    : Received GI tag for Narasapuram lace.
3. Uttar Pradesh                                : Top milk-producing state in India.
4. Kerala                                        :  Highest life expectancy in India.
5. West Bengal                                   : Highest population density in India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Assam is a major tea-producing state but not the *largest* in India.  Narasapuram lace is from Andhra Pradesh, not Tamil Nadu.  Uttar Pradesh is a leading milk producer, but its position as the absolute top producer may vary year to year.  Kerala consistently has high life expectancy, but whether it's the absolute highest can fluctuate.  West Bengal does not have the highest population density in India.  Therefore, only pair 1 is definitively correct based on consistent data.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision/Feature
1. Companies Act, 2013                           : Establishes the National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).
2. Consumer Protection Act, 2019                 :  Regulates the pricing of essential commodities.
3.  Trade Marks Act, 1999                         : Defines "well-known trademarks."
4.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986       :  Governs the Green Credit Program (GCP).
5.  Information Technology Act, 2000              :  Regulates e-commerce activities exclusively.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Companies Act, 2013, does not establish the NIFM; that's a separate entity. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, does not regulate essential commodity pricing; that's handled by other legislation. The Trade Marks Act, 1999, does define "well-known trademarks." The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides the legal framework for the GCP. The Information Technology Act, 2000, addresses a broader scope than just e-commerce.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                       Role/Focus
1. World Trade Organization (WTO)               :  Developed a permanent solution to the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue.
2. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD): Published a report on informal employment.
3.  Asian Development Bank (ADB)                 : Provides only bilateral assistance.
4.  International Solar Alliance (ISA)            : Headquartered in New Delhi.
5.  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) : Hosts the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The WTO has not yet developed a *permanent* solution to the PSH issue; the peace clause is an interim measure. The OECD has indeed published reports on informal employment. The ADB provides both bilateral and multilateral assistance. The ISA's headquarters is in Gurugram, India, not New Delhi.  The UNEP does host the UNEA.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Mechanism                 Feature/Function
1.  Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)                  : Exempt from Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.
2.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)     :  Always acquire shares, stocks, bonds, or marketable securities.
3.  Investor Protection Fund (IPF)                :  Administered by SEBI directly.
4.  Investor Services Fund (ISF)                 :  Funded partially by listing fees.
5. Social Stock Exchange (SSE)                   : Allows only Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) to raise funds.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

RRBs are *not* exempt from the PCA framework. NBFCs do not *always* acquire securities; it's one of their permitted activities. The IPF is administered by separate trusts created by stock exchanges and depositories, not directly by SEBI. The ISF is indeed partially funded by listing fees. The SSE allows both NPOs and For-Profit Enterprises (FPEs) to raise funds.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Program/Scheme                     Objective/Feature
1.  MGNREGA                                      :  Provides skilled employment only.
2.  Shree Anna Scheme                             : Aims to promote consumption of millets.
3.  Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme      :  Exclusively for the steel sector.
4.  Cluster Development Programme (CDP)           : Uses SURAKSHA platform for subsidy disbursement.
5.  National Food Security Mission                : Launched the Sub Mission on Millets.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

MGNREGA provides *unskilled* wage employment. The Shree Anna Scheme aims to promote millets. The PLI scheme is not exclusively for steel; it covers other sectors as well.  The CDP utilizes the SURAKSHA platform. The National Food Security Mission did launch the Sub Mission on Millets. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Location                          Feature/Characteristic
1. Assam                                         :  Located in the peninsular India.
2. Tamil Nadu                                    :  Major producer of jute.
3.  Kerala                                        :  Highest rainfall in India.
4. West Bengal                                   :  Located in the eastern part of India.
5.  India                                          :  Largest producer of milk globally.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Assam is in North East India, not peninsular India.  West Bengal is a major jute producer, but Tamil Nadu is not. Kerala receives high rainfall, but it's not the highest in India. West Bengal is located in eastern India. India is the world's largest milk producer. Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                      Geographical Feature
1. Assam                      Brahmaputra Valley
2. West Bengal                Sundarbans Delta
3. Tamil Nadu                 Nilgiri Hills
4. Kerala                      Western Ghats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Brahmaputra River flows through Assam, defining its major geographical character. The Brahmaputra Valley is a significant part of Assam's landscape and crucial to its economy and culture. The Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, is primarily located in the Bay of Bengal delta and spans across West Bengal and Bangladesh. The Nilgiri Hills, part of the Western Ghats, are a prominent geographical feature in Tamil Nadu, known for their biodiversity and tea plantations. The Western Ghats mountain range forms a significant part of Kerala's landscape and is a key factor shaping its climate and biodiversity.  All four pairs accurately match the state with a prominent geographical feature within its boundaries. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  A complete understanding of Indian geography is essential for correctly answering this question, demonstrating factual recall and application of geographical knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   State               Major Crop
1. Assam               Rubber
2. Tamil Nadu          Tea
3. Kerala              Rubber
4. Karnataka           Rubber


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kerala is the leading producer of rubber in India, contributing over 70% of the national output. This is a well-known fact in Indian agricultural geography. Karnataka also contributes significantly to India's rubber production, albeit at a smaller scale compared to Kerala. Assam is known for its tea production, not rubber.  While Tamil Nadu produces some rubber, its primary association is with tea production, particularly in the Nilgiris. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair, showcasing the need for precise knowledge of agricultural production patterns in India. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills in relating states to their primary agricultural output.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Dance Form          Originating State
1. Sattriya              West Bengal
2. Ojapali               Assam
3.  Chhau                Assam


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ojapali is a traditional theatrical form that originated in Assam. This is a well-established fact in the study of Indian performing arts. Sattriya is a classical dance form of Assam, not West Bengal. Chhau dance is associated with the eastern Indian states of Odisha, West Bengal, and Jharkhand, not Assam. Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the geographical distribution of Indian classical and folk dance forms, requiring specific knowledge of cultural heritage.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Festival                State
1.  Rongali Bihu           Kerala
2.  Thrissur Pooram       Assam
3.  Onam                  Kerala


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Onam is the major harvest festival of Kerala, a significant cultural event in the state's calendar. Rongali Bihu is the main spring festival of Assam, not Kerala. Thrissur Pooram is a prominent festival celebrated in Thrissur, Kerala, not Assam.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question evaluates factual recall and understanding of the geographical distribution of major festivals in India, demanding specific knowledge of cultural practices.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                  River
1. Assam                  Godavari
2. West Bengal            Brahmaputra
3. Tamil Nadu              Cauvery
4. Kerala                  Krishna


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Brahmaputra River is a major river flowing through Assam and is integral to the state's geography and culture. The Cauvery River is a vital river system in Tamil Nadu, crucial for irrigation and the state's economy.  The Godavari River does not primarily flow through Assam; it is located in peninsular India. The Krishna River is not a major river of Kerala; it flows through other parts of peninsular India. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include at least one mismatched pair.  The question necessitates a strong understanding of Indian river systems and their geographical distribution, testing factual recall and analytical skills.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                     Mineral
1. Karnataka                Bauxite

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kerala possesses significant monazite deposits, a crucial source of thorium. Andhra Pradesh is known for its mica reserves.  While Tamil Nadu has iron ore deposits, they are not its defining mineral resource.  Karnataka is associated with various minerals, but bauxite is not a particularly prominent one in comparison to other minerals.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect since they include at least one mismatched pair. This question tests the factual recall of mineral resources associated with specific Indian states.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Park         State
1. Kaziranga             Karnataka

3.  Sundarbans           Assam
4. Jim Corbett            Uttarakhand


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Kaziranga National Park is located in Assam, known for its one-horned rhinoceros population. Manas National Park is situated in Assam, and the Sundarbans National Park is located in West Bengal, known for its mangrove ecosystem and Royal Bengal Tigers. Jim Corbett National Park is located in Uttarakhand, famous for its tiger population.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  This question requires a good understanding of the locations of India's major national parks, demonstrating factual recall and geographical knowledge.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mohiniyattam is a classical dance form of Kerala, reflecting its cultural heritage.  Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form of Tamil Nadu, representing a significant part of its cultural identity. Kathakali is a classical dance form of Kerala, not Assam. Sattriya is a classical dance form of Assam, not West Bengal. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one mismatched pair. This question tests factual recall of the origin and association of prominent dance forms with their respective states, requiring detailed knowledge of Indian classical dance traditions.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   State              Festival
1. Assam              Onam

(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pongal is a harvest festival predominantly celebrated in Tamil Nadu, showcasing its agricultural significance. Durga Puja is a major festival in West Bengal, a crucial cultural event. Onam is the main harvest festival celebrated in Kerala, not Assam. Rongali Bihu is the major spring festival of Assam, not Kerala.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair. The question assesses the knowledge of major festivals celebrated in different Indian states, requiring precise knowledge of cultural events and their geographical distribution.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   State               Major River
1. Andhra Pradesh      Cauvery
2. Karnataka           Krishna

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Krishna River flows through Karnataka, playing a crucial role in its irrigation and economy. The Periyar River is a significant river system in Kerala, influencing its geography and ecology. The Cauvery River is primarily located in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, not Andhra Pradesh. The Godavari River is located in peninsular India, mainly in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, not Tamil Nadu. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one mismatched pair.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the facts presented.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Organization          Specific Function/Responsibility
    1. Ministry of Corporate Affairs  :   Regulates Payment System Participants
    2. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) : Manages Geographical Indication (GI) Tag registrations
    3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)    :   Refinances Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)
    4. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) : Regulates Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is indeed responsible for managing Geographical Indication (GI) Tag registrations.

Pair 1 is incorrect because the Ministry of Corporate Affairs primarily regulates companies, not Payment System Participants.  The RBI plays a crucial role in overseeing the Payment and Settlement Systems in India.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While NABARD refinances rural financial institutions, including PACS indirectly,  it does not directly refinance them. The refinancing happens through DCCBs and SCBs.  RBI does not refinance PACS.

Pair 4 is incorrect. The RBI regulates SCBs, not NABARD. NABARD's role is primarily focused on refinancing and development of the agricultural and rural sectors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Legislation                     Governing Body/Organization
    1. Cooperative Societies Act       :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
    2. Warehousing Corporations Act, 1962 :   Food Corporation of India (FCI)
    3. National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021 : Ministry of Cooperation
    4. Banking Regulation Act, 1949   :   State Registrar of Cooperative Societies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, is indeed governed and enforced by the RBI.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, but their regulation is primarily a state-level responsibility through the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies; RBI does not directly regulate them under this act.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) is established under the Warehousing Corporations Act, 1962, not the Food Corporation of India (FCI).  FCI is a separate entity involved in grain storage.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) was established by an Act of Parliament in 2021, but it's not under the purview of the Ministry of Cooperation.  The Ministry of Finance plays a key role in NaBFID's governance.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Program                   Implementing Ministry/Agency
    1. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) : Ministry of Cooperation
    2. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)       :   Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying
    3. Banks Heralding Accelerated Rural & Agriculture Transformation (BHARAT) campaign : Ministry of Electronics & IT
    4.  National Cooperative Database (NCD)           :   Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The National Cooperative Database (NCD) was indeed inaugurated by the Ministry of Cooperation.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a central sector scheme, but it's not under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has a key role in its implementation.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The BHARAT campaign is associated with banks and financial institutions to mobilize agricultural infrastructure projects, making the Ministry of Electronics & IT an inappropriate implementing agency. This campaign is likely overseen by the Ministry of Finance or a related ministry.


**4. With reference to the National Agricultural Research System (NARS), consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Institution                    Role/Function
    1. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) :   State-level agricultural research coordination
    2. State Agricultural Universities (SAUs)   :   National-level agricultural research coordination
    3. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)           :   On-farm testing of agricultural technologies
    4.  Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) :  National Agricultural Extension Services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. ICAR coordinates agricultural research at the national level, and KVKs conduct on-farm testing of agricultural technologies as an integral part of NARS.

Pair 2 is incorrect. SAUs coordinate agricultural research at the state level, not the national level.

Pair 4 is incorrect. CGIAR is an international organization, not involved in India's national agricultural extension services.  KVKs function as knowledge and resource centers linking NARS with extension systems and farmers.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Committee                       Specific Action/Outcome
    1. Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH) :   Established the National Turmeric Board
    2.  Spices Board India                        : Serves as the Secretariat for CCSCH
    3.  Ministry of Commerce                      :  Finalizes quality standards for spices
    4. National Turmeric Board                    : Hosts the 7th session of CCSCH


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?


(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Spices Board India does serve as the Secretariat for the Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH).

Pair 1 is incorrect.  The Government of India, not CCSCH, established the National Turmeric Board.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Commerce is involved in the overall regulation of the spice industry and the National Turmeric Board falls under its aegis, it is the CCSCH that finalized the quality standards for spices, not the Ministry itself.

Pair 4 is incorrect.  The 7th session of CCSCH was held in Kochi, India, but it wasn't hosted by the National Turmeric Board.  India, as a country, hosted the session.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution/Organization        Key Regulatory Function/Oversight
    1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :  Regulates Credit Information Companies (CICs)
    2. Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) : Provides deposit insurance for NBFCs
    3.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Regulates Housing Finance Companies
    4.  Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) : Regulates the National Pension System (NPS)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. The RBI regulates Credit Information Companies (CICs), and PFRDA regulates the National Pension System (NPS).

Pair 2 is incorrect. DICGC provides deposit insurance for banks, not NBFCs.

Pair 3 is incorrect. NUCFDC is an umbrella organization for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), not a regulator of Housing Finance Companies.  The RBI regulates Housing Finance Companies.


**7. With reference to the  "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector," consider the following pairs:**

    Implementing Agency              Specific Role/Contribution
    1. Food Corporation of India (FCI) :   Provides interest subvention benefits to PACS
    2. Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) :  Establishes decentralized storage facilities at the PACS level
    3. National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) :  Acts as the primary storage agency for food grains
    4. NABARD Consultancy Services (NABCONS) : Offers technical assistance for infrastructure development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. CWC is involved in establishing decentralized storage facilities at the PACS level, and NABCONS provides technical assistance for infrastructure development under the plan.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  The scheme provides subsidies and interest subvention benefits, but it's not FCI that directly provides them.  The Ministry of Cooperation plays a more direct role.

Pair 3 is incorrect. FCI is the main agency for grain storage at the national level, not NCDC.  NCDC is one of the major implementing agencies for this specific plan, but not the primary storage agency.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ministry/Department                      Scheme/Program
    1. Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers : Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)
    2. Ministry of Cooperation                :   National Cooperative Database (NCD)
    3. Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare : Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) 2024
    4. Ministry of Finance                     :   Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Ministry of Cooperation is indeed responsible for the National Cooperative Database (NCD).

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is the primary ministry involved in PMFBY's implementation.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers released the UCPMP 2024.

Pair 4 is incorrect. While AHIDF is a central-sector scheme, it falls under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, not the Ministry of Finance.  The Ministry of Finance's role is likely related to budgetary allocation or overall economic policy.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Institution                  Funding Source/Mechanism
    1. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)          :   State Governments
    2.  Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) :   NABARD through DCCBs and SCBs
    3.  National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) :   Social Impact Bonds
    4. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) :   100% Central Funding


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. PACS are refinanced by NABARD (through DCCBs and SCBs), and ICAR is 100% centrally funded.

Pair 1 is incorrect. KVKs are 100% financed by the Centre, not State Governments.

Pair 3 is incorrect.  While NABARD uses innovative financing mechanisms, including SIBs, it is not the primary or defining source of funding for NABARD itself. NABARD's funding comes from the Government of India.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Bank/Financial Institution              Specialization/Focus Area
    1. National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) : Short-term credit loans to farmers
    2.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)           :   Long-term infrastructure financing
    3.  Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)   :   Regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)
    4.  NABARD                               :   Refinancing of rural financial institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. NABARD is a specialized Development Financial Institution (DFI)  whose key function is refinancing of rural financial institutions.

Pair 1 is incorrect. NaBFID focuses on long-term infrastructure financing, not short-term credit to farmers.  PACS provide short-term credit to farmers.

Pair 2 is incorrect.  RBI's role is primarily regulatory and monetary policy, not direct long-term infrastructure financing. NaBFID is specifically designed for long-term infrastructure finance.

Pair 3 is incorrect.  RBI regulates NBFCs, not SCBs.  SCBs are commercial banks regulated directly by the RBI.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ideology                       Prominent Advocate
1. Socialism                       :   Jawaharlal Nehru
2. Secularism                     :   Bhagat Singh
3. Socialism                       :   Subhas Chandra Bose
4. Secularism                     :   Mahatma Gandhi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Jawaharlal Nehru was a prominent advocate of socialism in India, incorporating socialist principles into the Indian National Congress's ideology and shaping the post-independence economic policies.  His vision for a socialist India influenced the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Indian Constitution.  Subhas Chandra Bose, though initially associated with the more revolutionary Hindustan Republican Association, later also openly admired and advocated for socialist ideals, viewing them as crucial for India's independence and subsequent development. While Bhagat Singh's ideology was complex and encompassed various aspects, his advocacy for secularism is well-documented through his writings and activism against religious discrimination and communalism.  However, his alignment with socialism is less direct compared to Nehru and Bose. Similarly, Mahatma Gandhi's focus was primarily on Swaraj and non-violence, and while he did express some sympathy for socialist ideals regarding economic equality, he wasn't a central figure in the socialist movement's intellectual development like Nehru and Bose.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are accurately matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings based on a nuanced understanding of the historical context and the ideological positions of the individuals listed.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment Act        Principal Focus
1. 42nd Amendment Act, 1976         :   Inclusion of Fundamental Duties
2. 73rd Amendment Act, 1992         :   Establishment of Municipalities
3. 74th Amendment Act, 1992         :   Establishment of Panchayats
4. 97th Amendment Act, 2011         :   Cooperative Societies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 is indeed known for significantly amending the Constitution, including the addition of Fundamental Duties to Part IV-A. The 97th Amendment Act of 2011 is correctly linked to Cooperative Societies, as it granted constitutional status to these organizations.  However, options (a), (c), and (d) contain errors. The 73rd Amendment Act established Panchayats, not Municipalities; that was the function of the 74th Amendment Act.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly link the amendment acts with their respective focuses, reflecting a misunderstanding of the constitutional amendments and their specific impacts on Indian governance.


**3. With reference to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Term in the Preamble                     Meaning/Implication
1. Socialist                               :   Economic equality and social justice
2. Secular                                :   Religious tolerance and freedom of conscience
3. Sovereign                               :   Independent and self-governing
4. Republic                                :   Head of state is an elected representative



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The term "Socialist" in the Preamble reflects a commitment to social and economic justice, striving for a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. "Secular" signifies the state's neutrality towards religion, guaranteeing freedom of conscience and religious tolerance.  "Sovereign" indicates India's independence and self-governance, free from external control. Finally, "Republic" means the head of state (President) is elected, not hereditary, underscoring democratic principles.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the Preamble's core tenets.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                     Contribution to the Indian Constitution
1. B.R. Ambedkar                            :   Chairman of the Drafting Committee
2. Jawaharlal Nehru                          :   Moved the Objectives Resolution
3. K.M. Munshi                               :   Calligrapher of the Preamble
4. Prem Behari Narain Raizada               :   Member of the Drafting Committee



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

B.R. Ambedkar's role as Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly is a well-established fact, signifying his crucial contribution in shaping the Constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru's pivotal role in moving the Objectives Resolution, which served as the foundational document for the Preamble, is also historically accurate.  However, options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies. K.M. Munshi was a prominent member of the Constituent Assembly and contributed significantly to the drafting process, but he did not calligraph the Preamble; that was done by Prem Behari Narain Raizada.  Prem Behari Narain Raizada was the calligrapher, not a member of the Drafting Committee. Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Other options demonstrate a misunderstanding of the individuals' specific roles in the Constitution's creation.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                   Subject Matter
1. Article 263                              :   Inter-State Council
2. Article 30                               :   Right to Property
3. Article 368                              :   Amendment Procedure
4. Article 300A                            :   Right of Minorities to Establish Educational Institutions



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 263 correctly relates to the establishment of the Inter-State Council, a crucial mechanism for addressing inter-state disputes and fostering cooperation. Article 368 accurately defines the amendment procedure for the Constitution. However, options (a), (c), and (d) contain mismatches. Article 30 relates to the rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions, not the right to property. That right was initially a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31, but was later made a constitutional right under Article 300A after the 44th Amendment.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are accurately matched.  The other options reflect a confusion regarding the subject matter of the given articles.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                 Key Provision/Feature
1. Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 :   Minimum marriage age of 18 for women and 21 for men
2. Consumer Protection Act, 1986          :   Establishment of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
3. Competition Act, 2002                   :   Regulation of monopolies and restrictive trade practices
4.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006:  Grants forest rights to Scheduled Castes



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, correctly specifies the minimum marriage age as 18 for women and 21 for men. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, established the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission as a quasi-judicial body. The Competition Act, 2002, aims to prevent monopolies and restrictive trade practices. However, option (d) is incorrect because the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, grants forest rights to Scheduled Tribes, not Scheduled Castes. Therefore only pairs 1,2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the fourth pair, reflecting a misunderstanding of the Act's key provisions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                                    Association with Socialism
1. Mahatma Gandhi                          :   Critical of its implications for individual liberty
2. Subhas Chandra Bose                     :   Advocate for its implementation in independent India
3. M.N. Roy                                :   Early proponent and founding member of the CPI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the relationship between the named individuals and their views on socialism. Mahatma Gandhi, while advocating for economic equality, was critical of certain aspects of socialism, particularly its potential to curtail individual liberties.  Subhas Chandra Bose, though his approach differed from Nehru's, was a strong advocate for the implementation of socialist principles in independent India, viewing it as essential for national development and social justice. M.N. Roy's significant role in introducing socialist thought in India and his involvement in the founding of the Communist Party of India (CPI) are well-documented. Therefore, option (d) is correct. The other options incorrectly omit one or more of these accurate associations, suggesting an incomplete understanding of the individuals' perspectives on socialism.


**8. With reference to the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                   Impact
1. Addition of "Socialist" to the Preamble  :   Strengthened commitment to socialist principles
2. Addition of "Secular" to the Preamble    :   Reinforced commitment to religious tolerance
3. Inclusion of Fundamental Duties           :   Enhanced citizen responsibilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, is notable for its significant changes to the Indian Constitution. The addition of "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble explicitly reflected the government's commitment to these principles.  The inclusion of Fundamental Duties aimed to enhance citizen responsibilities towards the nation. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these key impacts of the 42nd Amendment, demonstrating a partial understanding of its transformative effects on the Constitution.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Institution           Key Function/Responsibility
1. University Grants Commission (UGC)     :   Disbursing grants to universities and colleges
2. National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) :   Headed by the Chief Justice of India
3. Inter-State Council                       :   Chaired by the Prime Minister


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC's primary function is indeed the disbursement of grants to universities and colleges, supporting higher education in India. The Inter-State Council is correctly identified as being chaired by the Prime Minister, providing a platform for Centre-State collaboration. However, the NCDRC is not headed by the Chief Justice of India; it is a quasi-judicial body with its own chairperson. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the second pair, indicating a misunderstanding of the NCDRC's structure and leadership.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                   Key Feature
1.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006:  Grants forest rights to Scheduled Castes
2.  National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission:  Set up under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986
3.  Competition Act, 2002                        :  Enforced by the Competition Commission of India (CCI)
4.  Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006       :  Replaced the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first pair is incorrect. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, grants forest rights to Scheduled Tribes, not Scheduled Castes. The remaining three pairs are correctly matched.  The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission was indeed set up under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  The Competition Act, 2002, is enforced by the CCI. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, replaced the earlier Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the first pair, showcasing a misunderstanding of the Act's key provisions.

Here are some difficult UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided factual data, focusing on Saudi Arabia, India, Iran, Afghanistan, and other countries.  Each question includes plausible distractors and requires in-depth knowledge for accurate answering.  Remember, the information provided in the questions is assumed to be true.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country             |  Significant Economic Activity
1.  Saudi Arabia       |  Largest global crude oil exporter
2.  India              |  Largest global milk producer
3.  Iran               |  Leading producer of carpets
4.  Indonesia          |  Largest global palm oil exporter
5.  China              |  Largest global coal producer


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Saudi Arabia is indeed the largest global exporter of crude oil, holding significant influence in OPEC and global energy markets.  Iran is a major carpet producer, renowned for its traditional and high-quality carpets, which are a significant export commodity. China's dominance in coal production is well-established due to its extensive reserves and large-scale mining operations.  These three pairs are correctly matched.

Option (c) is incorrect because while Indonesia is a major palm oil exporter, its status as the *largest* global exporter is debatable and requires further verification. It competes with Malaysia for this position. India is indeed the largest global milk producer, but this fact is not relevant to the other pairs or distractors in this question.  Option (a) is incomplete, and option (d) is incorrect due to the uncertain status of Indonesia as the largest palm oil exporter.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to evaluate the accuracy of each pair based on their knowledge of global economic activities.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country           |  Major Import Commodity
1.  India             |  Coking coal
2.  China            |  Mica
3.  Pakistan         |  Edible Oils
4.  Indonesia        |  Iron Ore
5.  Afghanistan     |  Natural Rubber


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India heavily relies on coking coal imports for its steel industry due to insufficient domestic high-grade coking coal reserves. Pakistan, despite having some domestic production, is a significant importer of edible oils to meet its growing domestic demand.  These two pairs are correctly matched.

The other options include incorrect pairings.  China is a major *exporter*, not importer, of mica, given its large domestic reserves.  Indonesia is a major exporter of iron ore and natural rubber, not an importer. Afghanistan's economy is largely agrarian and resource-based, its imports would likely focus on manufactured goods and technology, not natural rubber.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring candidates to differentiate between major exporters and importers of various commodities.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country             |  Neighboring Country
1.  Saudi Arabia       |  Kuwait
2.  Iran               |  Armenia
3.  Afghanistan        |  Uzbekistan
4.  Pakistan           |  India
5.  China              |  North Korea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs represent correctly matched neighboring countries. Kuwait shares a land border with Saudi Arabia. Armenia shares a land border with Iran. Uzbekistan shares a land border with Afghanistan. India shares a land border with Pakistan. North Korea shares a land border with China.

This question primarily tests factual recall of geographical information, specifically focusing on the land borders of various countries in the region.  The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the geography of the region, including less obvious neighbor relationships.  All options except (a) are incomplete, testing the candidate's ability to identify complete and accurate pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Port                    |  Country
1.  Kandla Port           |  India
2.  Gwadar Port           |  Pakistan
3.  Chabahar Port        |  Iran
4.  Duqm Port             |  Oman
5.  Chittagong Port       |  Bangladesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Kandla Port is a major port in India. Gwadar Port is located in Pakistan. Chabahar Port is located in Iran. Duqm Port is located in Oman. Chittagong Port is the major port of Bangladesh.

This question directly tests the candidate's knowledge of the location of major ports in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. The options are structured to ensure that candidates cannot guess easily, requiring precise knowledge of each port's location.  All incorrect options are designed to create plausible distractors by including some correct and some incorrect pairs.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is a multimodal transport project connecting the Indian Ocean to Northern Europe.
2.  The Chabahar Port in Iran is a part of the INSTC.
3.  India signed a tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan for the development of the Chabahar Port.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The INSTC is indeed a significant multimodal transport project designed to improve connectivity between India, Russia, and Europe via Iran and Central Asia.  Chabahar Port is a crucial component of this corridor, significantly enhancing India's access to Central Asia.  India, Iran, and Afghanistan signed a tripartite agreement in 2016 to develop Shahid Beheshti terminal at Chabahar Port. This agreement aimed to bypass Pakistan and improve trade and connectivity with Afghanistan and Central Asia. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the INSTC, Chabahar Port's strategic importance, and India's regional engagement initiatives.  Incorrect options present plausible distractors by making combinations of one or two correct statements.



These questions are designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills beyond simple factual recall, aligning with the UPSC exam's demanding nature.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, requiring candidates to have a strong grasp of the subject matter to select the correct answers.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, focusing on factual recall and analysis.  Remember, the questions are framed assuming the veracity of the information presented in the source material.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    River              |  Country
    1. Litani River      |  Syria
    2. Pennaiyar River  |  Bangladesh
    3. Oder River       |  Germany
    4. Vistula River    |  Poland


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Litani River is located in Lebanon, not Syria.  The Pennaiyar River is an interstate river in India, flowing through Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, hence not in Bangladesh. The Oder River flows through Germany and Poland, making option 3 correct. The Vistula River is the longest river in Poland, making option 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of river locations and involves plausible distractors by including rivers from different geographical regions and incorrect country pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Bridge             | State/Region
    1. Pamban Bridge   |  Andhra Pradesh
    2. New Pamban Bridge | Tamil Nadu
    3.  New Pamban Bridge | Kerala


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The original and new Pamban bridges connect Mandapam on the mainland to Rameswaram island in Tamil Nadu.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because the Pamban Bridge is not in Andhra Pradesh. Pair 3 is incorrect as the New Pamban bridge is not in Kerala. The question tests factual recall of bridge locations and includes plausible distractors by using similar-sounding names and states in close proximity.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Sea/Water Body      |  Characteristic
    1. Baltic Sea         | Largest expanse of saltwater
    2. Baltic Sea         | Artificially linked to White Sea
    3. Black Sea         |  Largest expanse of brackish water


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Baltic Sea is the largest expanse of brackish water in the world, not saltwater. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The Baltic Sea is artificially linked to the White Sea via the White Sea Canal, making pair 2 correct. The Black Sea is not the largest expanse of brackish water; that is the Baltic Sea. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. The question tests knowledge of geographical features and their characteristics, employing distractors that involve close but incorrect attributes.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme  |  Implementing Ministry
    1. Namo Drone Didi Scheme | Ministry of Women and Child Development

    3. Atal Innovation Mission | Ministry of Science and Technology


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Namo Drone Didi Scheme is implemented under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The PM Vidyalaxmi Scheme falls under the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. The Atal Innovation Mission is indeed an initiative of the Ministry of Science and Technology, making pair 3 correct.  The question assesses understanding of Indian government schemes and their respective ministries, utilizing plausible distractors by including related but incorrect ministries.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tourism Type         | Example Location
    1. Dark Tourism        |  Gulf of Mannar
    2. Dark Tourism        | Chernobyl
    3. Dark Tourism        |  Rameswaram


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Gulf of Mannar and Rameswaram are not examples of dark tourism sites; they are geographical locations.  Chernobyl, however, is a prominent dark tourism site due to the nuclear disaster.  The question tests the understanding of  tourism types and their associated locations, using distractors that are geographically related but not examples of dark tourism.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

    River Water Dispute |  Involved States

The Mahadayi water dispute is between Goa and Karnataka. The question tests knowledge of significant interstate water disputes in India and their involved states.  The options are designed to make the selection challenging by offering combinations of correct and incorrect pairings.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization |  Primary Focus
    1. International Energy Agency (IEA) | Renewable Energy
    2. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) | Energy Security
    3. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) | Food Security and Nutrition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IEA's primary focus is on energy security, not renewable energy, although it increasingly addresses renewable energy issues.  IRENA focuses on renewable energy, not energy security. The FAO's focus is indeed on food security and nutrition. Thus only statement 3 is correctly matched. The question assesses understanding of international organizations and their mandates, using distractors that are related but incorrect focuses.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country             | Highest Civilian Award
    1. Bhutan             | Order of the Druk Gyalpo
    2. Maldives           | National Award of Honour
    3. Saudi Arabia       | King Abdulaziz Sash of Distinction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Order of the Druk Gyalpo is Bhutan's highest civilian award, making pair 1 correct.  While Maldives and Saudi Arabia have their highest awards, the names provided in pairs 2 and 3 are not entirely accurate.  The question tests knowledge of highest civilian awards in different countries, using distractors of similar-sounding awards.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Island/Island Group     |  Surrounding Water Body
    1. Rameswaram Island    |  Bay of Bengal
    2. Andaman and Nicobar Islands | Indian Ocean
    3. Maldives             | Arabian Sea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Rameswaram Island is located in the Bay of Bengal, making pair 1 correct. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are primarily in the Bay of Bengal, not the Indian Ocean, although they are part of the larger Indian Ocean region.  The Maldives are located in the Indian Ocean, not the Arabian Sea.  The question tests knowledge of island locations and surrounding water bodies, using distractors that are partially correct or geographically close.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country | Capital City
    1. Indonesia | Kuala Lumpur
    2. Malaysia | Jakarta
    3. Philippines | Manila


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?


(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Kuala Lumpur is the capital of Malaysia, not Indonesia. Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia, not Malaysia. Manila is indeed the capital of the Philippines. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests factual recall of capital cities, using distractors that involve switching capital cities between neighboring countries.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 exercise and related information about Gujarat.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to major military exercises conducted in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Exercise Name                     Location
    1.  Sanyukt Vimochan 2024        :   Rajasthan
    2.  Garud Shakti                    :   Andhra Pradesh
    3.  Yudh Abhyas                     :   Karnataka
    4.  Vajra Prahar                    :   Maharashtra

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 was indeed a significant multilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) exercise, but it was conducted in Gujarat, not Rajasthan.  Garud Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and Indonesia, typically held in alternating locations in both countries.  While the exact location can vary, it's not consistently held in Andhra Pradesh. Yudh Abhyas is an annual joint military training exercise between India and the United States, and its location also varies.  Vajra Prahar, another India-US joint exercise, is also not consistently conducted in Maharashtra. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched according to the provided information.  The question tests factual recall of the locations of various military exercises. The distractors are plausible because many exercises are conducted across different states in India.


**2. With reference to India's significant annual joint military exercises, consider the following pairs:**

    Exercise Name                     Participating Country
    1.  Sanyukt Vimochan 2024        :   France
    2.  Cope India                     :   Australia
    3.  SIMBEX                          :   Bangladesh
    4.  Sangam                          :   Vietnam

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 is a multilateral exercise involving various Indian armed forces and foreign delegations, but not exclusively with France. Cope India is a joint air force exercise between India and the United States, not Australia. SIMBEX is a maritime bilateral exercise between India and Singapore, not Bangladesh.  Sangam is a joint naval special forces exercise between India and the United States, not Vietnam.  The incorrect options present plausible distractors by including countries that frequently participate in joint military exercises with India.  This question tests factual recall of participating countries in various joint military exercises.



**3. With reference to the state of Gujarat and its geographical features, consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Feature             Characteristic
    1.  Gulf of Kutch                  :   Highest point in Gujarat
    2.  Gir National Park              :   Known for Asiatic Lions
    3.  Aravalli Range                 :   Coastal region of Gujarat
    4.  Thar Desert                   :   Largest wetland in Gujarat


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Gir National Park is indeed famous for its Asiatic lion population. The Gulf of Kutch is a coastal region, not the highest point (that would be in the Western Ghats).  The Aravalli Range is not located in the coastal region of Gujarat; it's an inland mountain range. The Thar Desert extends into Gujarat, but it does not contain the largest wetland (that would be a different geographical feature). This question assesses factual recall and understanding of Gujarat's geography, using plausible but incorrect pairings as distractors. The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between geographical features and their characteristics.


**4. With reference to significant government initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative Name                Implementing Ministry
    1.  Project Veer Gatha           :   Ministry of Corporate Affairs
    2.  Atal Innovation Mission     :   Ministry of Defence
    3.  Sanyukt Vimochan 2024     :   Ministry of Culture

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Project Veer Gatha is implemented by the Ministries of Education and Defence, not the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The Atal Innovation Mission falls under NITI Aayog, not the Ministry of Defence.  Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 is a defence exercise, falling under the Ministry of Defence. None of the pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of government schemes and their implementing ministries, using carefully chosen distractors to increase difficulty. The option format encourages careful consideration of each pair.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 exercise:**

    1.  It is a bilateral exercise.
    2.  It involved only the Indian Army.
    3.  It simulated a flood scenario.
    4. It was conducted in a coastal region.

    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 4 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because Sanyukt Vimochan 2024 was a *multilateral* exercise, involving various Indian armed forces and foreign delegations. Statement 2 is incorrect because it involved various Indian armed forces, not just the Indian Army. Statement 3 is incorrect; it simulated a *cyclone* scenario, not a flood scenario. Statement 4 is correct because the exercise simulated a cyclone in Gujarat's coastal region.  The question tests detailed understanding of the exercise's nature and scope, using distractors that are partially true or close to the truth but ultimately incorrect. The option format makes simple guessing less likely.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                          Headquartered in
1. Defence Space Agency                 :   New Delhi
2. Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) :   Mumbai
3. Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)      :   Bengaluru

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The Defence Space Agency is headquartered in Bengaluru, Karnataka. The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) do not have a single headquarters;  they are spread across different locations depending on the individual force.  The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has its headquarters in New Delhi. Thus, none of the provided pairs are correctly matched in terms of headquarters location.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry                                 Organization under its purview
1. Ministry of Home Affairs                :   National Investigation Agency (NIA)
2. Ministry of Home Affairs                :   Department of Atomic Energy
3. Ministry of Defence                     :   Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The NIA falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The Department of Atomic Energy is under the Prime Minister's Office, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The DRDO operates under the Ministry of Defence. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Treaty                                    Key Feature/Provision
1. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)       :   Came into force in 2007
2. Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)                  :   Brokered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
3. Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 :   Applies only to Jammu and Kashmir

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) came into force in 1997, not 2007. The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) was brokered by the World Bank, not the IMF. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, applies to several states in Northeast India and not solely to Jammu and Kashmir (although a similar act exists for J&K). Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Function/Responsibility
1. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF)   :   Guarding Indian borders
2.  International Solar Alliance (ISA)        :   Headquartered in New Delhi
3.  Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)     :   Jointly established by FAO and WHO

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The CISF is responsible for the security of vital installations and not for guarding India's borders. The ISA is headquartered in Gurugram, India, not New Delhi. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is indeed jointly established by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise                         Participating Nations
1. Exercise Sea Dragon                    :   India, USA, Australia, South Korea, Japan
2. Exercise Malabar                       :   India, France, Germany, Greece
3. Tiger Triumph                           :   India and the US

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Exercise Sea Dragon involves India and other nations, but the specific list provided is incorrect. Exercise Malabar is a joint exercise between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States, not the nations listed in option 2. Tiger Triumph is correctly identified as a bilateral exercise between India and the U.S. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Missile                                   Developed by
1. Agni-V                                   :   Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
2. K-4 (Kalam-4)                           :   Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
3.  Prithvi                                  :   Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Agni-V is indeed developed by the DRDO.  The K-4 missile is developed by DRDO, not ISRO. Prithvi missile was also developed by DRDO, not BDL. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization             Headquarters Location
1.  International Monetary Fund (IMF)    :   Geneva
2.  International Seabed Authority (ISA):   Kingston, Jamaica
3.  BRICS                                  :   New Delhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The IMF is headquartered in Washington, D.C., not Geneva. The ISA is correctly located in Kingston, Jamaica. BRICS does not have a permanent headquarters.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Treaty/Agreement                         Signatory Countries
1.  Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)              :   India and Bangladesh
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)   :   India and Pakistan
3.  Paris Agreement                         :   India and the United States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The Indus Waters Treaty is between India and Pakistan, not India and Bangladesh. The Chemical Weapons Convention has many signatory countries, but the pairing is incorrect. The Paris Agreement does include both India and the United States as signatories.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                  Implementing Agency/Ministry
1.  Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024 :   Ministry of External Affairs
2.  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967:   Ministry of Home Affairs
3.  Model Prisons Act 2023                :   Ministry of Law and Justice

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, are implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of External Affairs. The UAPA is correctly under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Model Prisons Act 2023 is also under the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of Law and Justice.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                  Key Characteristic/Feature
1. Human Development Index (HDI)             :   Developed by Amartya Sen
2. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)       :   Measures deprivations in health, education, and living standards
3.  Gender Inequality Index (GII)             :   Focuses solely on economic inequality

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The HDI was developed by Mahbub ul Haq, not Amartya Sen. The MPI accurately reflects deprivations across multiple dimensions. The GII measures gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation, not solely economic inequality.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   UN Body                                  Function/Focus Area
1. UNCTAD                                   :   Promoting sustainable tourism
2. FAO                                      :   Monitoring global food security
3. WHO                                     :   Regulating international trade
4. UN Statistical Commission              :   Providing data on global investment trends
5. UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) :   Electing members to the UNCTAD

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 2 and 4 only.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays a crucial role in monitoring global food security, collecting data, and providing analysis on food production, distribution, and access. This aligns perfectly with its mandate.  The UN Statistical Commission is responsible for coordinating international statistical activities, including the collection and dissemination of data related to various economic indicators, which naturally includes global investment trends.  Option 1 is incorrect because while UNCTAD is involved in sustainable development,  promoting sustainable tourism is not its primary or exclusive focus.  Option 3 is incorrect; the World Health Organization (WHO) focuses on public health, not international trade regulation.  That falls under the purview of the World Trade Organization (WTO).  Option 5 is correct; ECOSOC does elect members to UNCTAD.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are accurately matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Activity/Role
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                 :   Regulating Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)
2. Government of India                         :   Issuing bonds to the RBI
3. Supreme Court                              :   Implementing monetary policy
4. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :   Authorized by the RBI
5. Bank for International Settlements (BIS)    :   Setting PSL targets for RRBs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 1, 2, and 4 only. The RBI regulates ARCs, a crucial function in managing financial stability. The Government of India indeed issues bonds to the RBI as part of its borrowing program. The NPCI, responsible for various payment systems in India, operates under the authorization of the RBI. Option 3 is incorrect because the RBI, not the Supreme Court, implements monetary policy. Option 5 is incorrect; the BIS is an international organization for central banks, not involved in setting Priority Sector Lending (PSL) targets for Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 represent accurate matches.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                    Specific Action/Initiative
1. UNCTAD                                     :   Published the Global Investment Trends Monitor
2. World Bank                                  :   Mediated the Indus Waters Treaty
3. International Monetary Fund (IMF)           :   Developed the policy uncertainty index
4. International Cooperative Alliance (ICA)    :   Acts as a regulatory body for cooperatives worldwide
5. OPEC+                                      :   Maximizes oil production


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) Only one
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) Only two. UNCTAD publishes the Global Investment Trends Monitor as part of its mandate to track global investment flows. The World Bank played a crucial role in mediating the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan.  Option 3 is incorrect; the RBI, not the IMF, developed the policy uncertainty index. Option 4 is incorrect; the ICA represents cooperatives, it doesn't regulate them. Option 5 is incorrect; OPEC+ aims for price stability, not maximizing production. Therefore, only two pairs (1 and 2) are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Relevant Association/Treaty
1. India                                       :   Member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)
2. Iceland                                     :   Member of EFTA
3. France                                      :   Member of EFTA
4. Norway                                     :   Member of EFTA
5. Poland                                      :   Member of EFTA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) 2 and 4 only. Iceland and Norway are members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).  Option 1 is incorrect; India is not a member of EFTA. Option 3 is incorrect; France is a member of the European Union, not EFTA. Option 5 is incorrect; Poland is a member of the European Union.  Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 show correct matches.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                     Publication/Report
1. UNCTAD                                      :   Trade and Development Report
2. World Bank                                   :   Global Economic Prospects report
3. International Monetary Fund (IMF)            :   World Economic Outlook report
4. International Transport Forum (ITF)          :   Annual International Debt Report
5. Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)        :   Commodity Markets Outlook


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) 1, 2, and 3 only.  UNCTAD publishes the Trade and Development Report. The World Bank publishes the Global Economic Prospects report. The IMF publishes the World Economic Outlook report. Option 4 is incorrect; the World Bank, not the ITF, publishes the Annual International Debt Report. Option 5 is incorrect; the World Bank publishes the Commodity Markets Outlook. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

UNCTAD's work includes the Investment Facilitation Agreement. Dispute settlement is a core function of the WTO. OPEC's primary objective is regulating the oil supply. BRICS has a Contingency Reserve Arrangement. EFTA's focus is on free trade among its members; balancing investment protection with sovereign rights is not its primary focus and is more related to India's evolving BIT approach. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.



These questions demonstrate the application of the specified criteria.  They are designed to test deeper understanding than simple factual recall and require careful analysis of the given information to arrive at the correct answer.  The distractors are carefully crafted to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, requiring a nuanced understanding of the facts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Rocket                     Engine Type

    3. Agni-5                   Solid fuel only
    4.  Prithvi                  Liquid fuel only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) utilizes primarily solid propellant in its stages, although some versions may incorporate liquid stages.  Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct but not entirely accurate given the nuances of PSLV's design variations.  The GSLV Mk III (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III) is known to employ both solid and liquid rocket motors across its four stages, making statement 2 correct. Agni-5, an Indian intercontinental ballistic missile, is designed with solid-propellant stages for its mobility and rapid deployment capabilities, making statement 3 correct. Prithvi, another Indian missile, is actually a short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile that uses liquid propellant, making statement 4 incorrect. Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are entirely correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall about different Indian rocket and missile technologies and their propellant types. The inclusion of both rockets and missiles as distractors increases the difficulty level.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is indeed transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes (specifically *Aedes albopictus* and *Aedes aegypti*), making statement 1 correct.  Zika virus is also spread through the bite of infected *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes, making statement 2 correct. Dengue fever is transmitted by *Aedes* mosquitoes, not *Culex* mosquitoes, making statement 3 incorrect. Malaria is caused by parasites transmitted through the bite of infected female *Anopheles* mosquitoes, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of vector-borne diseases and their respective vectors.  The inclusion of a common mosquito genus (*Culex*) as a distractor makes the question more challenging.

    1. BT Cotton                  Pest resistance
    2. GM Mustard                 Herbicide tolerance
    3.  Wheat                      High yield potential
    4. Rice                        Salt tolerance (specific varieties)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

BT cotton is genetically modified to express a bacterial protein (Bt toxin) that provides resistance to certain pests, making statement 1 correct. GM mustard (DMH-11) is engineered for herbicide tolerance, allowing farmers to use herbicides to control weeds without harming the crop, making statement 2 correct. While wheat exhibits high yield potential through various breeding programs, this is not a defining characteristic of genetically modified wheat specifically, making statement 3 less precise. Specific varieties of rice are developed for salt tolerance, a characteristic that can be achieved through genetic modification or conventional breeding, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The question tests knowledge of genetically modified crops and their traits, highlighting the complexities of agricultural biotechnology. The inclusion of a general crop characteristic (high yield) as a distractor increases the difficulty.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Organization                    Action/Association

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                     Property/Use
1. Ammonia                               :  Component of Ammonium nitrate fertilizer
2. Methane                               : Used to produce Ammonia
3. Nitrate                               : Converted from Ammonia through nitrification
4. Amino acids                           : Precursor of Ammonia
5. Nitric acid                            : Produced from Ammonia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ammonia is a crucial component of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, a widely used nitrogenous fertilizer in agriculture.  Methane is indeed a primary feedstock in the industrial production of ammonia through the Haber-Bosch process.  Nitrification is a biological process where ammonia (NH3) is oxidized to nitrite (NO2-) and then to nitrate (NO3-), essential steps in the nitrogen cycle.  Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, *contain* nitrogen, and ammonia serves as a nitrogen source for their synthesis in biological systems, but it is not their precursor in the primary sense; rather, it's a product of their breakdown. Finally, nitric acid is commercially produced through the Ostwald process, which uses ammonia as a starting material. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Pair 4 is incorrect because amino acids are not precursors of ammonia; rather, the reverse is true.  Ammonia is a product of amino acid catabolism.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Standard                 Related to Ammonia
1. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)       :  Regulation of ammonia production
2. World Health Organization (WHO)     :  Drinking water quality standards for ammonia
3. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO):  Ammonia emissions from agriculture
4. International Organization for Standardization (ISO):  Ammonia handling safety standards


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) sets standards for various industrial chemicals, including ammonia production and its safe handling within India. The World Health Organization (WHO) establishes guidelines for safe drinking water, including permissible levels of ammonia, which are adopted by nations worldwide. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) focuses on agricultural practices and their environmental impact, including ammonia emissions from fertilizer use and livestock farming.  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops international standards for various industrial processes and safety protocols, including those related to handling and transportation of ammonia.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  Each organization plays a distinct, yet interconnected, role in managing aspects related to ammonia.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biogeochemical Process                Ammonia Role
1. Nitrification                           :  Ammonia is the substrate
2. Denitrification                        :  Ammonia is a byproduct
3. Ammonification                        :  Ammonia is the product
4. Nitrogen fixation                     : Ammonia is a direct product


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nitrification is the process where ammonia is oxidized to nitrite and then nitrate; thus, ammonia is indeed the substrate. Ammonification is the process by which organic nitrogen is converted into ammonia; therefore, ammonia is a product.  Denitrification, however, is the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas, not a process producing ammonia.  While nitrogen fixation converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, it does so indirectly through intermediates, not as a direct product.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly include processes that don't directly involve ammonia as a primary product or substrate.



**4. Consider the following statements about the effects of ammonia:**

1. Ammonia is harmful to humans.
2. Ammonia is toxic to fish.
3. Ammonia reduces carcinogenic by-products in water treatment.
4. Ammonia is a contaminant of drinking water.

How many of the statements given above are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ammonia is indeed harmful to humans at high concentrations, causing respiratory irritation and other health problems.  Similarly, ammonia is highly toxic to aquatic life, particularly fish, even at relatively low concentrations.  However, statement 3 is incorrect as the use of ammonia in water treatment aims to reduce *other* harmful by-products (like chloramines) or to disinfect, not to reduce carcinogens. The chloramines formed by reaction of ammonia with chlorine, are themselves potentially harmful. Ammonia can be a contaminant of drinking water sources due to agricultural runoff and sewage, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) are correct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Industry/Sector                       Ammonia Use/Emission Source
1.  Agriculture                          :  Ammonia emission source through fertilizers
2.  Refrigeration                       :  Ammonia used as a refrigerant
3.  Water treatment                    :  Ammonia used as a disinfectant precursor
4.  Explosives manufacturing           :  Ammonia used in production of explosives
5.  Textile industry                     :  Ammonia emission source from dyeing processes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Agriculture is a major source of ammonia emissions, primarily from the volatilization of nitrogenous fertilizers containing ammonia or ammonium. Ammonia has historically been used as a refrigerant due to its excellent thermodynamic properties, although its toxicity necessitates careful handling. In water treatment, ammonia is used as a precursor to chloramines, which are disinfectants, reducing the formation of trihalomethanes. Ammonia is also used in the production of various explosives. Finally, the textile industry utilizes ammonia in dyeing and finishing processes, leading to ammonia emissions.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, representing diverse industrial applications and emission sources of ammonia.  The options incorrectly exclude one or more of these valid pairings.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Species                                  Ammonia Impact
1. Humans                                :  Respiratory irritation at high concentrations
2. Fish                                   :  Toxicity leading to mortality
3.  Cattle                               :  Ammonia emission through waste products
4.  Plants (general)                     :  Nutrient source for growth
5.  Microorganisms (general)           :  Substrate for nitrification


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia gas can cause respiratory irritation and other health problems in humans. Ammonia is highly toxic to aquatic organisms like fish, often leading to mortality.  Cattle release ammonia as a byproduct of their digestive processes, contributing significantly to agricultural ammonia emissions.  Ammonia is a valuable source of nitrogen, essential for plant growth.  Many microorganisms utilize ammonia as a nitrogen source or a substrate in various metabolic processes, including nitrification.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched, highlighting the multifaceted impacts of ammonia on various biological entities.  Any option excluding even one of these correct pairs would be incorrect.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Water Body/Location                  Ammonia Presence/Source
1.  Drinking water sources              :  Ammonia as a contaminant
2.  Sewage water                         :  Ammonia as a component
3.  Agricultural runoff                 :  Ammonia as a pollutant
4.  Composting systems                 :  Ammonia as a byproduct
5.  Marine ecosystems                   :  Ammonia as a nutrient


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ammonia can contaminate drinking water sources through various pathways, including agricultural runoff and sewage discharge. Sewage water naturally contains ammonia as a byproduct of organic matter decomposition.  Agricultural runoff carries ammonia from fertilizers and animal waste, polluting water bodies.  Composting processes result in ammonia release from the decomposition of organic materials.  Ammonia plays a crucial role as a nutrient in marine ecosystems, supporting phytoplankton growth and the food web.  Therefore, all five pairs correctly link ammonia's presence or origin to specific water bodies or locations.  Any option that does not include all five pairs would be inaccurate.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Waste Management Practice            Ammonia's Role
1.  Composting                          :  Ammonia is a byproduct
2.  Sewage treatment                    :  Ammonia is removed
3.  Landfill sites                       :  Ammonia is generated during decomposition
4.  Incineration                         : Ammonia is destroyed during combustion
5.  Recycling of organic waste          : Ammonia is produced


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Composting produces ammonia as a byproduct of the decomposition of organic matter.  Sewage treatment plants aim to remove ammonia to prevent water pollution.  Landfills generate ammonia from decomposing organic waste.  Incineration of waste materials destroys ammonia through high-temperature combustion.  Recycling of organic waste, depending on the method, can sometimes lead to ammonia production. Therefore, all five pairs correctly describe ammonia's role within various waste management scenarios.  Any option omitting even one of these correct pairings would be incorrect.  The question tests both factual knowledge and the ability to connect different waste management practices with a single chemical compound.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Mexico has historically been a major silver producer and, while the exact ranking fluctuates based on annual production figures, it consistently features among the top global producers of silver.  Chile holds the distinction of possessing the world's largest copper reserves, a significant factor in its economy.  Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete.  Option (c) is incorrect; while Sweden has substantial iron ore reserves, it's not definitively the largest in Europe, and Uganda's position as the largest cotton producer in Africa is also debatable depending on the year and global market fluctuations.  Option (d) is partially correct in that India is a leading tea producer globally, but it is not definitively the largest producer, and the other pair (Mexico's silver production) is also debatable. The other options incorrectly pair countries with their resources or significantly overstate their claim to a particular resource.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the information presented.

**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                     Primary Language
1. Gujarat                       Marathi
2. Maharashtra                  Gujarati
3. Tamil Nadu                   Telugu
4. Andhra Pradesh               Tamil
5. Kerala                        Malayalam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 5 only

**Explanation:**

Malayalam is the primary language of Kerala.  The other options are incorrect. Gujarati is the primary language spoken in Gujarat, not Marathi. Marathi is the primary language of Maharashtra, not Gujarati.  Tamil is the primary language of Tamil Nadu, not Telugu. Telugu is the primary language of Andhra Pradesh, not Tamil.  Therefore, only option (a) accurately matches a state/UT with its primary language.  The distractors in this question play on the geographical proximity of states and the potential for linguistic overlap across regions, creating plausible but ultimately incorrect matches.

**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                                  Originating State

(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Cauvery River originates in Karnataka, the Godavari River originates in Maharashtra, and the Brahmaputra River originates in Arunachal Pradesh.  These are well-established geographical facts. Options (a) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because the Narmada River originates in Madhya Pradesh, not Gujarat, and the Tapti River originates in Madhya Pradesh as well, not in Tamil Nadu.  The inclusion of these incorrect pairs serves as effective distractors, testing the examinee's precise knowledge of river origins.  Therefore, option (b) is the only completely accurate response.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mountain Range                   State/UT Primarily Located In

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

*Conocarpus erectus* (a mangrove species) has been identified as an invasive species and banned in Gujarat. *Ludwigia peruviana* (primrose willow) is an invasive weed particularly problematic in Tamil Nadu. Option (a) is incorrect because *Conocarpus erectus* is invasive in Gujarat, not Tamil Nadu.  Option (b) is partially correct, but only *Ludwigia peruviana* is a problem in Tamil Nadu. Option (d) is incorrect because *Prosopis juliflora* is invasive in many states but is not primarily associated with Kerala.  Option (c) correctly identifies two invasive species and their locations. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific invasive species and their impact on different Indian states. The other options include plausible distractors based on the general spread of invasive species, requiring precise knowledge of their distribution for correct identification.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Shaji's Catfish is an endangered species found in Kerala, and the Pygmy Hog is a threatened species found in Chhattisgarh. Option (a) is incorrect because the African penguin is not found in Tamil Nadu. The Nilgiri Tahr is endemic to the Western Ghats of India and is not located in South Africa.  The Assam Roofed Turtle is not found in Namibia. Option (b) and (c) are incorrect because they contain at least one incorrect pairing.  Option (d) correctly matches two threatened species with their locations within India.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific threatened species found in various Indian states and countries, using plausible distractors to increase the difficulty level.


**10. Consider the following statements:**

    1.  The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR is triggered by air quality index (AQI) levels.
    2.  The CAQM is responsible for implementing GRAP.
    3.  GRAP uses four stages to categorize air quality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) and its implementation in the Delhi-NCR region.  GRAP is indeed triggered based on AQI levels, exceeding certain thresholds leads to the implementation of increasingly stringent measures. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) is the designated authority responsible for implementing and overseeing the GRAP.  GRAP employs a four-stage system (poor, very poor, severe, severe-plus) to classify air quality levels, each stage triggering specific actions.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer since it includes all three true statements. There are no incorrect statements presented, making this a direct test of factual knowledge concerning GRAP.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 4 only

**Explanation:**

*Trigona* species are stingless bees. This is a correct identification. The other pairings are incorrect. *Apis cerana indica* is the Asiatic honey bee, *Apis dorsata* is the giant rock bee, and *Apis florea* is the dwarf honey bee.  The incorrect pairings serve as plausible distractors, especially for those with some general knowledge of honeybees but lacking precise knowledge of specific species. The question tests detailed knowledge about specific honeybee species found in India. Only option (a) contains a correctly matched pair.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

*Conocarpus erectus* is an invasive mangrove species that has shown invasive characteristics in Kerala.  *Prosopis juliflora* is also an invasive species that poses a significant problem in Gujarat.  The other options are incorrect.  *Ludwigia peruviana* is invasive in Tamil Nadu, not Assam. "Pink Bloom" refers to *Ludwigia peruviana* and is not a separate species and is problematic in Kerala, not Odisha. Oleander is a problem in Kerala, not Tamil Nadu.  This question tests the examinee's specific knowledge of invasive plant species and their locations in India.  The incorrect pairings use plausible distractors based on the overall distribution of these species. Only option (b) contains entirely correct matches.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question aims for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall and analysis.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Publication
1. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) :  World Conservation Strategy
2. World Wildlife Fund (WWF)           :  Living Planet Report
3. Zoological Survey of India (ZSI)   :  State of India's Birds Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The IUCN is indeed responsible for publishing the World Conservation Strategy, a significant document outlining global conservation priorities.  The WWF is also correctly paired with the Living Planet Report, a biennial publication that assesses the state of global biodiversity.  However, the State of India's Birds Report is a collaborative effort involving various organizations, including the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), not solely the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI). ZSI contributes significantly to avian research in India, but the report is a broader initiative. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the correctly matched pair concerning IUCN. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pair related to ZSI. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair concerning ZSI. The question successfully tests factual recall about major conservation organizations and their publications, demanding precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Species                          IUCN Red List Category
1.  African Elephant                 : Critically Endangered
2.  Amur Leopard                     : Vulnerable
3.  Snow Leopard                     : Near Threatened
4.  Asian Giant Tortoise              : Endangered
5.  White Rhinoceros                 : Least Concern


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Asian Giant Tortoise is correctly categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.  The other options present plausible distractors.  African elephants are listed as Endangered, not Critically Endangered;  Amur Leopards are Endangered, not Vulnerable; Snow Leopards are Vulnerable, not Near Threatened; and White Rhinos are Near Threatened, not of Least Concern.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the IUCN Red List categories for specific species, requiring precise recall of conservation status.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related categories (e.g., Endangered vs. Vulnerable, Critically Endangered vs. Endangered).


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                       Document
1.  Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)    :  Kyoto Protocol
2.  Green Climate Fund (GCF)                     :  Paris Agreement
3.  Loss and Damage Fund (LDF)                   :  UNFCCC

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a financial mechanism under the UNFCCC, established to support developing countries in climate change mitigation and adaptation.  The Paris Agreement, while building upon the UNFCCC, plays a crucial role in operationalizing the GCF.  However, NDCs are a central component of the Paris Agreement, not the Kyoto Protocol.  The Loss and Damage Fund was established under the UNFCCC framework, but its operationalization and funding mechanisms were further developed through subsequent COP meetings.  Therefore, only pair 2 is entirely accurate. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the relationship between international climate agreements and their associated mechanisms, demanding a nuanced understanding of climate finance and policy instruments.  The distractors are designed to test if the candidate understands the historical development of climate agreements and their evolution.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Protected Area                      Location
1.  Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve         :  Uttarakhand
2.  Bandipur Tiger Reserve            :  Karnataka
3.  Keibul Lamjao National Park      :  Manipur
4.  Dachigam National Park             :  Jammu and Kashmir
5.  Kaziranga National Park           :  Assam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Bandipur Tiger Reserve is in Karnataka, Keibul Lamjao National Park is in Manipur, Dachigam National Park is in Jammu and Kashmir and Kaziranga National Park is in Assam. However, the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve spans across parts of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, not solely Uttarakhand.  This question tests knowledge of India's important protected areas and their geographical locations, requiring specific recall of facts. The distractor (option 1) is designed to confuse candidates who may have a general understanding of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve but lack precise knowledge of its location.  The other options test for comprehensive knowledge of the protected areas.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Species                     IUCN Red List Status
1.  Hangul (Kashmir Stag)       : Vulnerable
2.  Nilgiri Tahr                 : Endangered
3.  Sangai Deer                 : Critically Endangered
4.  Indian Pangolin            : Least Concern
5.  Hoolock Gibbon (Western)   : Endangered


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Nilgiri Tahr is correctly listed as Endangered, and the Western Hoolock Gibbon is correctly listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.  The other options include plausible but incorrect pairings. The Hangul (Kashmir stag) is Endangered, not Vulnerable; the Sangai deer is Endangered, not Critically Endangered; and the Indian Pangolin is Vulnerable, not of Least Concern. The question assesses the candidate's ability to recall the precise conservation status of various species as categorized by the IUCN Red List, requiring detailed factual knowledge.  The distractors are carefully chosen to represent species from similar geographical regions or ecological niches, increasing the difficulty level.


These five questions provide a diverse range of difficulty levels while adhering to the prompt's instructions.  They effectively test factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills crucial for success in the UPSC examination.  The inclusion of plausible distractors ensures that simple guessing is unlikely to yield the correct answer, rewarding candidates with a strong command of the subject matter.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    ICT Sector Entity                      Function/Characteristic
1. Data Centre                            :   Stores and manages large amounts of data
2. Service Provider                       :   Offers internet access and other services
3. Body Corporate                         :   Legally recognized entity with cybersecurity obligations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because all three pairs are correctly matched. Data centres are integral parts of the ICT sector, their primary function being the storage and management of vast amounts of data. Service providers, such as internet service providers (ISPs), telecommunication companies, and cloud service providers, are key players in the ICT sector, offering various services, including internet access and data transmission.  The term 'Body Corporate' encompasses a wide range of legal entities, including companies and organizations, and many such entities have legal cybersecurity responsibilities under various laws and regulations.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the functions and characteristics of these entities within the context of the ICT sector and cybersecurity. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Olympic Games Aspect                  Fact
1. Origin                               :   8th Century BCE, Greece
2. First Modern Games                   :   Athens, Greece
3. Asian Countries Hosting Olympics    :   Japan and China only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only the first pair is correctly matched. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in the 8th century BCE.  However, the second and third pairs are incorrect. While the first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, not Paris.  Additionally, several Asian countries besides Japan and China have hosted the Olympic Games, including South Korea.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pairs or incorrectly state that none of the pairs are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall regarding the history of the Olympic Games and geographical distribution of its hosting.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Sea Foam Component                  Description
1. Micelles of minerals                 :   Primarily formed by wave action on organic matter
2. Organic material, wind, and waves   :   Contribute to sea foam formation along ocean shores
3. Salt and minerals from seawater    :   Contribute minimally to sea foam formation
4. Heavy metals from industrial pollution:   Not a primary component of sea foam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). While micelles do play a role in sea foam formation, they are primarily formed from organic materials, not minerals.  The primary components of sea foam are organic materials broken down by wave action, along with the influence of wind. Salt and minerals from seawater contribute negligibly to sea foam's structure.  Heavy metals from industrial pollution are not a primary component, though they can be present as pollutants within the foam.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary composition of sea foam and/or include factors that are not significant contributors. This question tests understanding of a natural phenomenon and its components.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indian State                          Action Regarding Mayonnaise
1. Karnataka                             :   Banned raw egg mayonnaise for one year
2. Tamil Nadu                            :   Imposed restrictions on raw egg usage in food
3. Andhra Pradesh                        :   Implemented stricter food safety regulations
4. Telangana                             :   Has no recent ban on raw egg mayonnaise

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Karnataka recently decided to ban the production, sale, and storage of all mayonnaise made from raw eggs for one year. While other states might have regulations concerning raw eggs in food products or broader food safety measures,  the specific action of a one-year ban on raw egg mayonnaise is unique to Karnataka as far as recent news indicates.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they falsely attribute the specific action to other states or include states that have not taken this particular action.  This question tests knowledge of recent state-level actions and their specific details.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indira Gandhi Prize Feature          Fact
1. Awarded Since                       :   1986, annually
2. Awarded By                           :   Ministry of External Affairs
3. Nominee Selection                    :   National and International nominees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development has been awarded annually since 1986.  The recipients are indeed chosen from a pool of national and international nominees. However, the prize is awarded by the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, not the Ministry of Culture or any other government ministry.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the awarding body or incorrectly include the incorrectly matched pair.  This question assesses knowledge of an award, its history, and its administration.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

3. Medication Role                       :   Medications play a crucial role in prevention and treatment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

3. President’s Rule on States            :   Challenges the imposition of President's rule
4. Permanent Remission                 :   Addresses issues related to remission of sentences

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The *Laxman Naskar versus Union of India* judgment primarily relates to preventive detention.  The case challenged the legality and due process surrounding preventive detention under specific circumstances.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. While the other topics (right to privacy, President's rule, and permanent remission) are important areas of constitutional and legal discourse in India, they are not the central theme of this specific judgment. This question tests knowledge of a specific legal case and its subject matter.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prakash Singh judgment of 2006 is fundamentally related to police reforms.  The Supreme Court laid down several directives aimed at improving police efficiency, accountability, and governance structure. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. While the judgment has implications for environmental protection, electoral processes, and judicial accountability, these are not its primary focus.  The core of the judgment centers on enhancing the effectiveness and transparency of the police force. This question assesses understanding of a landmark Supreme Court judgment and its key themes.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) focuses on promoting solar energy technologies and renewable energy as a whole.  Its mandate directly addresses the development and deployment of solar energy technologies across its member countries. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) similarly focuses on the global scale-up of renewable energy deployment, promoting its adoption worldwide through various initiatives. The UNFCCC's core objective is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. This involves a wide range of actions, including emission reduction through various strategies and agreements. The IEA's primary focus is ensuring global energy security through efficient and sustainable energy policies and technological advancements, which indirectly contributes to climate change mitigation. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Option (a) only includes ISA, neglecting the accurate pairings of IRENA and UNFCCC. Option (b) correctly identifies ISA and IRENA but omits the UNFCCC's core focus on greenhouse gas emission reduction. Option (c) correctly matches IEA and UNFCCC but excludes the correct pairings of ISA and IRENA. Therefore, option (d) is the only option that encompasses all the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Partnership/Collaboration
1. International Solar Alliance (ISA)        :   World Bank

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Armenia's membership in the ISA is explicitly stated in the provided context.  France is a founding member of the ISA, making its membership accurate. India is also a founding member and thus a member of the ISA. South Korea's membership status is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but its inclusion as a signatory to the ISA Framework Agreement strongly suggests its membership.  Switzerland, however, is not listed among the members or signatories, making the "No" pairing accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are partially correct but incomplete. They fail to include all the accurately matched pairs. Option (d) correctly identifies all the countries with their respective ISA membership status.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was launched during COP21.
2. The ISA's secretariat is located in Gurugram, India.
3. The ISA aims to promote the use of fossil fuels alongside solar energy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that the ISA was jointly launched by India and France during COP21. Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly mentions that the ISA secretariat is located in Gurugram. Statement 3 is incorrect. The ISA's primary aim is to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement through the massive deployment of *solar* energy, which is a renewable energy source.  Promoting the use of fossil fuels would contradict the core objective of the ISA and the Paris Agreement itself. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer as it accurately identifies the correct statements. Option (a) is incomplete, while options (c) and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the false statement about fossil fuels.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Prithviraj Kapoor was not a recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.  While he was a highly influential figure in Indian cinema, the award went to other prominent personalities.  M.S. Subbulakshmi, though a renowned Carnatic vocalist, did not receive the Bharat Ratna.  She received other prestigious awards, but not the Bharat Ratna. Amrita Pritam received the Jnanpith Award for her significant contributions to Punjabi literature. Amartya Sen is a Nobel laureate and received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his work in economics and philosophy.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of awardees and their associated awards, demanding specific knowledge beyond general awareness.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lal Bahadur Shastri hailed from Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh, not Gujarat. Jayaprakash Narayan was associated with Bihar and other parts of India, not primarily West Bengal.  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was born in Mecca, but his significant political and social contributions were deeply rooted in Uttar Pradesh.  Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan's primary association was with the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), now part of Pakistan.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests the understanding of the geographical origins and significant associations of prominent Indian personalities, requiring a thorough knowledge of Indian history and politics.


**4. With reference to newspapers published by Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following pairs:**

   Newspaper                          Language

The question assesses factual recall regarding the languages in which Gandhi's publications appeared, requiring precise knowledge of his journalistic work. The inclusion of incorrect language pairings acts as effective distractors.


**5. With reference to classical languages of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Language                                  Script Primarily Used
1. Tamil                                     :   Kharosthi
2. Sanskrit                                  :   Brahmi
3. Malayalam                                :   Grantha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Tamil is primarily written in the Tamil script, not Kharosthi.  Sanskrit has been written in various scripts throughout history, but Brahmi isn't its primary script historically. Malayalam uses the Malayalam script, and Grantha is a script associated with Sanskrit and other South Indian languages, but not primarily with Malayalam. Only Malayalam's association with the Grantha script is accurate among the options.  The question tests knowledge about the scripts historically and currently associated with India's classical languages, demanding detailed information.  The incorrect pairings serve as strong distractors, requiring careful evaluation.

2. Civil Disobedience Movement           :   Jawaharlal Nehru
3. Quit India Movement                     :   Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Although all the listed individuals were involved in the Indian independence movement, the primary leadership of the movements is different from what is presented in the pairs.  The Non-Cooperation Movement was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi, not Subhas Chandra Bose, although Bose was a significant figure in the movement.  The Civil Disobedience Movement was also primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi, not Jawaharlal Nehru, who played a crucial role but not as the primary leader. The Quit India Movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi, not Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, even though Patel played a significant role in its execution. Thus, none of the pairs are correctly matched. The question tests the understanding of the leadership roles in major movements of the Indian independence struggle, requiring in-depth knowledge to identify the inaccuracies.

This question tests the knowledge of regional festivals and art forms, demanding specific and accurate information. The incorrect pairings are designed to be plausible distractors.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                                     Significant Contribution/Association
1. Amritlal Vithaldas Thakkar                :   Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh
2. Thakkar Bapa                             :   Tribes of India (book)
3. Raja Ravi Varma                          :   Indian Home Rule Society

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Amritlal Vithaldas Thakkar, also known as Thakkar Bapa, was the founder of the Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh.  Thakkar Bapa authored the book "Tribes of India." Raja Ravi Varma was a renowned painter, not associated with the Indian Home Rule Society (founded by Shyamji Krishna Varma). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of individuals and their contributions to social reform and Indian history.  The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but incorrect association acts as a significant distractor.


**10. With reference to the Doddalathur Megalithic Site, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                   Characteristic
1. Location                                 :   Tamil Nadu
2. Discovery Year                           :   1951
3. Primary Structure Type                   :   Burial Mounds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Doddalathur Megalithic Site is located in Karnataka, not Tamil Nadu.  The site was discovered in 1961, not 1951. The megalithic structures at Doddalathur are primarily memorials, but burial structures have also been identified.  Only the statement about the primary structure type (megalithic structures) is accurate. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of a specific archaeological site, requiring detailed information to distinguish between correct and incorrect characteristics.  The incorrect information provides strong distractors.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

   Architectural Style                         Region/Country Primarily Associated
1. Najdi Architectural Style                :   Yemen
2.  Cheriyal Scroll Painting Style          :   Chhattisgarh
3.  Doddalathur Megalithic Style           :   Andhra Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Najdi architectural style is primarily associated with Saudi Arabia, not Yemen. Cheriyal Scroll Painting is a unique art form of Telangana, not Chhattisgarh. The Doddalathur Megalithic site is in Karnataka, not Andhra Pradesh. Only the Najdi architectural style's association with Saudi Arabia is correct. Therefore only pair 1 is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of different art and architectural styles and their regional associations, demanding specific knowledge and careful evaluation of options.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                                  Book/Literary Work
1.  Brahma Bandhab Upadhyay                 :   Sophia
2.  Aurobindo Ghosh                         :   Sandhya
3.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati              :   Young India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Brahma Bandhab Upadhyay is not associated with the book "Sophia". Aurobindo Ghosh is associated with Sandhya.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati did not author "Young India"; it was associated with Mahatma Gandhi.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the knowledge of authors and their literary works, requiring specific recall of lesser-known works and associations.  The incorrect pairings serve as strong distractors.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ruler                                     Dynasty/Empire
    1. Narasimhadeva I                         :  Eastern Ganga Dynasty
    2. Narasimhavarman I                       :  Pallava Dynasty
    3. Kanishka                               :  Kushana Empire
    4. Pulakeshin II                           :  Chalukya Dynasty

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall about significant rulers and their respective dynasties in Indian history.  Option (d) correctly identifies the dynasties associated with each ruler.  Narasimhadeva I was a prominent ruler of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, known for his patronage of the arts and architecture, including the Konark Sun Temple. Narasimhavarman I belonged to the Pallava dynasty, a powerful South Indian dynasty that flourished between the 7th and 9th centuries CE. Kanishka was a Kushana emperor who expanded the Kushana empire significantly and is remembered for his patronage of Buddhism. Pulakeshin II was a ruler of the Chalukya dynasty, famous for his military victories and achievements in architecture and literature.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding the chronological context and geographical distribution of these dynasties is crucial for correctly answering this question. The inclusion of Kanishka and Pulakeshin II as distractors tests the candidate's knowledge beyond the immediate context of the Konark Sun Temple.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Fort                                      Significant Feature
    1. Raigad Fort                             :  Strong fortifications and defensive structure
    2. Gwalior Fort                           :  Strategic location on a hilltop
    3. Chittor Fort                            :  Extensive water management system
    4. Jaisalmer Fort                          :  Built of yellow sandstone


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

This question assesses factual recall about prominent Indian forts and their defining characteristics.  Option (d) correctly matches each fort with a key feature. Raigad Fort is renowned for its robust fortifications and strategic design which earned it the moniker "Gibraltar of the East." Gwalior Fort's strategic hilltop location provided excellent defensive capabilities. Chittor Fort is known for its sophisticated water management systems that ensured water supply even during sieges. Jaisalmer Fort is famous for its construction using yellow sandstone, giving it a distinctive appearance. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correct pairing.  The question tests not only the knowledge of the forts but also the understanding of their geographical contexts and architectural features. Including less well-known features of other forts like Gwalior and Chittor acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's depth of knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Religious Festival                  Location
    1. Kumbh Mela                          :  Prayagraj
    2. Rath Yatra                            :  Puri
    3. Ambubachi Mela                       :  Kamakhya Temple, Assam
    4. Hornbill Festival                     :  Nagaland


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The question tests the knowledge of major religious and cultural festivals in India and their locations. Option (c) accurately identifies the locations of each festival. The Kumbh Mela is a major Hindu pilgrimage held at four locations, including Prayagraj.  The Rath Yatra is a significant festival celebrated annually in Puri, Odisha. The Ambubachi Mela is associated with the Kamakhya Temple in Assam. The Hornbill Festival is a major cultural festival of Nagaland. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they miss at least one correct pairing. The inclusion of less prominent festivals like Ambubachi Mela and Hornbill Festival adds complexity, ensuring a deeper understanding of Indian cultural diversity is necessary to answer the question correctly. The question also tests interdisciplinary linkage by connecting religious practices with their geographical locations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Award                                 Recipient (example)
    1. Dadasaheb Phalke Award             :  Mithun Chakraborty
    2. Bharat Ratna                          :  Mahatma Gandhi
    3. Jnanpith Award                        :  Amrita Pritam
    4. Padma Vibhushan                      :  Lata Mangeshkar


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall of various Indian awards and their recipients. Option (c) correctly pairs each award with an example of a recipient. Mithun Chakraborty is a recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. Mahatma Gandhi was awarded the Bharat Ratna. Amrita Pritam received the Jnanpith Award. Lata Mangeshkar was a recipient of the Padma Vibhushan. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs. The question tests the candidate's awareness of significant awards and their connection to prominent personalities across different fields.  The inclusion of less-known recipients for some awards like Jnanpith Award increases the difficulty level, requiring a broader understanding of India's award system.  The question also implicitly tests understanding of the prestige and significance associated with each award.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Social Reformer/Leader                 Significant Contribution
    1.  Lal Bahadur Shastri                 :  Prime Minister of India
    2.  Sir Syed Ahmed Khan                :  Founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College
    3.  Mahatma Gandhi                     :  Led the Non-Cooperation Movement
    4.  Dayanand Saraswati                 :  Founded the Arya Samaj


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge about prominent figures in Indian history and their significant contributions. Option (d) correctly matches each individual with one of their key achievements. Lal Bahadur Shastri served as the Prime Minister of India. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, a pivotal institution in the Aligarh Movement. Mahatma Gandhi led the Non-Cooperation Movement, a crucial phase in India's struggle for independence.  Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj, a significant Hindu reform movement. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect since they leave out at least one correctly paired item. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the historical context and impact of each individual's work.  Including diverse figures like Lal Bahadur Shastri, a political leader, and Dayanand Saraswati, a religious and social reformer, broadens the scope of the question and assesses a comprehensive understanding of Indian history. The question implicitly tests the ability to categorize individuals based on their roles and contributions.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, employing plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Jayaprakash Narayan is known for organizing the Azaad Dasta, a freedom brigade employing guerrilla warfare. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the "Missile Man of India," authored the inspirational autobiography "Wings of Fire." Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, a key figure in modern Indian history, founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental (MAO) College, a pivotal institution for Muslim education. Rani Chennamma of Kittur led an armed rebellion against the British East India Company in 1824, notably opposing the Doctrine of Lapse. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  A complete understanding of Indian history and key figures is necessary to accurately answer this question.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Festival                     Location/State
1. Mera Hou Chongba                  : Manipur
2. International Abhidhamma Divas   : Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi
3. Kittur Utsava                      : Bailhongal Fort, Karnataka

(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Mera Hou Chongba is a festival celebrated in Manipur. International Abhidhamma Divas, commemorating the Buddha's teachings, was celebrated at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi. Kittur Utsava, honoring Rani Chennamma, is associated with Bailhongal Fort in Karnataka. The Battle of Walong took place in Arunachal Pradesh during the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Knowledge of Indian geography, festivals, and historical events is crucial for accurate matching.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Language                         Status/Characteristic
1. Pali                              : Classical Language of India
2. Prakrit                           :  Ancestor of Pali
3. Assamese                         : Included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  While Pali is a classical language, it's not explicitly declared a *classical language of India* in the provided text.  Prakrit is indeed an ancestor language to Pali, and Assamese is correctly listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. Option (a) is incorrect as statement 1 is partially true (Pali is a classical language but not specifically declared as such by the Indian government in the given context). Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is not fully accurate. Option (d) is incorrect because it only includes one correct pair.  This question tests knowledge of linguistic history and the official language status in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                            Associated Field/Achievement
1. Amritlal Vithaldas Thakkar       :  Established Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh
2. D Vaikuntam                     : Cheriyal Scroll Painting
3. Brahma Bandhab Upadhyay         :  Social and Political Reform in Modern India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Amritlal Vithaldas Thakkar (Thakkar Bapa) established the Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh.  D Vaikuntam is associated with the Cheriyal Scroll Painting art form. Brahma Bandhab Upadhyay was a significant figure in the Swadeshi movement and a journalist, not primarily known for social and political reform in *modern* India as a whole, though he certainly contributed.  Option (b) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pairing. Option (c) is also incorrect, including only one correct pairing. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an inaccurate pairing (3). The question tests knowledge of social reformers and artists in India.



**5.  With reference to the highest civilian awards in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Award Recipient                     Year of Award
1.  A.P.J. Abdul Kalam               : 1999
2.  Jayaprakash Narayan              : 1999
3.  Mahatma Gandhi                  : 1954


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Jayaprakash Narayan were both posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1999.  Mahatma Gandhi was one of the first recipients of the Bharat Ratna, but the award was conferred in 1947, not 1954. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only contain one correctly matched pair. Option (d) is incorrect due to the incorrect year associated with Mahatma Gandhi's Bharat Ratna award. This question tests knowledge of India's highest civilian award and its recipients.  The distractor plays on the fact that both Kalam and Narayan received the award in the same year, but with a potentially confusing year given for Gandhi.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Art Form                       State/Region of Origin
1. Cheriyal Scroll Painting        : Telangana
2.  Kimkhab                         : Uttar Pradesh
3.  Warli Painting                   : Maharashtra
4.  Pithora Paintings                : Madhya Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly match the art form with its state/region of origin. Cheriyal Scroll Painting is a unique art form of Telangana. Kimkhab is a type of brocade weaving originating in Uttar Pradesh.  Warli Painting is a tribal art form of Maharashtra. Pithora Painting is a folk art form of Madhya Pradesh. All options except (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Indian art forms and their geographical origins.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                          Significant Work/Publication
1. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan           :  The Causes of the Indian Mutiny

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan authored "The Causes of the Indian Mutiny." Brahma Bandhab Upadhyay published the journal "Sophia." Amritlal Vithaldas Thakkar (Thakkar Bapa) wrote "Tribes of India." Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of authors and their works.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of less prominent figures and their publications.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Award                             Awardee (at least one)
1. Bharat Ratna                      :  P.V. Narasimha Rao
2. Padma Awards                       :  MS Swaminathan
3. Sangeet Natak Akademi Amrit Awards :  84 artists


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. P.V. Narasimha Rao is a recipient of the Bharat Ratna.  MS Swaminathan received Padma Awards. The Sangeet Natak Akademi Amrit Awards were conferred on 84 artists.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests the candidate’s awareness of various Indian awards and their recipients, requiring knowledge beyond the most commonly known Bharat Ratna recipients.  The distractors aim to test detailed knowledge of award recipients across different categories.


**9. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Walong was fought in the easternmost part of Arunachal Pradesh.
2.  The Battle of Walong lasted for 27 days.
3.  Indian troops at Walong were outnumbered by Chinese forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The Battle of Walong, a significant event in the 1962 Sino-Indian War, was indeed fought in the easternmost part of Arunachal Pradesh. The battle lasted for over 27 days, showcasing the resilience of the Indian soldiers.  Significantly, the Indian troops were heavily outnumbered by the Chinese forces, highlighting the disparity in military strength. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correct statement.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of a specific historical military event and its details.


**10. With reference to the recognition of classical languages in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Classical Language             Year of Declaration
1.  Tamil                          : 2004
2.  Sanskrit                       : 2005
3.  Bengali                        : 2024


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Tamil was declared a classical language in 2004, and Sanskrit in 2005. The provided text mentions that Bengali was declared a classical language along with others in October 2024, but not the exact date. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include an incorrectly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the chronology of recognition for classical languages in India, focusing on the years of declaration, a detail which could be easily forgotten.



These questions demonstrate the intended format and difficulty level, requiring detailed factual knowledge and analytical skills for accurate responses.  They also incorporate various distractors and avoid obvious or easily guessable answers. Remember that the difficulty level is subjective and can vary depending on the candidate's background and preparation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, including factual recall, analysis, and application.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   	Art Form                         State of Origin
    1.  Paitkar Painting                 :  Bihar
    2.  Jadu Patua Painting             :  West Bengal
    3.  Sohrai Painting                 :  Jharkhand
    4.  Madhubani Painting              :  Uttar Pradesh

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only Sohrai Painting originates from Jharkhand.  The other options present incorrect pairings. Paitkar painting is associated with Mithila region of Bihar, while Jadu Patua painting is a folk art form of West Bengal. Madhubani painting is also a style of Mithila painting, primarily from Bihar.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, as all the listed art forms are Indian folk paintings, potentially confusing candidates unfamiliar with their precise origins. This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar cultural expressions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Individual              Gift Received/Given
    1. Vladimir Putin        : Sohrai Painting
    2. Narendra Modi         :  Sohrai Painting
    3.  Vladimir Putin        :  A painting by a Jharkhand artist
    4. Narendra Modi         :  A folk painting from Hazaribagh

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted a Sohrai painting to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  This makes statement 2 correct.  Statement 3 is also correct as a Sohrai painting is a folk painting from Jharkhand and hence qualifies as "a painting by a Jharkhand artist".  Statement 1 is incorrect because Vladimir Putin received the painting; he did not give it. Statement 4 is too general and does not specify the exact type of painting. The question tests factual recall of the news event and the ability to understand the nuances of the descriptions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Location      Associated Feature
    1. Hazaribagh district, Jharkhand :  High incidence of thunderstorms
    2.  Jharkhand                    :  Production of bauxite
    3.  Ranchi, Jharkhand           :  Location of Baidyanath Temple
    4.  Jharkhand                    :  Occurrence of tornadoes

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Hazaribagh district in Jharkhand is known for its high incidence of thunderstorms.  Jharkhand is a significant producer of bauxite. Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand, houses the Baidyanath Temple. However, tornadoes are not a characteristic feature of Jharkhand's climate; thunderstorms are more prevalent.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of tornadoes as a distractor tests the candidate's knowledge of regional geography and meteorological patterns.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

    1. Sohrai painting is primarily practiced by tribal women in Jharkhand.
    2. The Sohrai festival is directly associated with Sohrai paintings.
    3.  The colours used in Sohrai paintings are entirely foraged from the wild.

    How many of the above statements are correct?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Sohrai painting is a matriarchal tradition primarily practiced by tribal women in Jharkhand.  Statement 2 is also correct; Sohrai paintings are intrinsically linked to the Sohrai festival, often created and displayed during the celebrations. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While some colors are foraged, the text explicitly states that some are also purchased from local merchants, indicating a mixed source.  Therefore, only two statements are correct. This question tests factual recall and the ability to critically evaluate information presented.



**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Religious Figure/Movement     Associated Text/Concept
    1.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati   :   Rigved Bhashyam
    2.  Arya Samaj                   :   Emphasis on Vedic principles
    3.  Swami Vivekananda            :   Bhagavad Gita
    4.  Brahmo Samaj                 :   Monotheistic beliefs

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Swami Dayanand Saraswati authored Rigved Bhashyam.  Arya Samaj, founded by him, strongly emphasized a return to Vedic principles.  Brahmo Samaj, while having diverse interpretations, generally promoted monotheistic beliefs.  However, Swami Vivekananda's primary focus was on Vedanta philosophy and the Bhagavad Gita, although he did not solely focus on the latter.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The inclusion of Swami Vivekananda as a distractor tests the examinee's knowledge of various religious figures and their associated philosophies.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Location                          Associated Feature
    1.  Kevadiya, Gujarat              :   Raigad Fort
    2.  Rashtrapati Bhavan             :   Replicas of Konark wheels
    3.  Amrit Udyan                   :   Replicas of Konark wheels
    4.  Odisha                         :   Konark Sun Temple

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The backdrop for Rashtriya Ekta Diwas celebrations at Kevadiya, Gujarat, featured Raigad Fort.  Replicas of Konark wheels were installed at Rashtrapati Bhavan Cultural Centre and Amrit Udyan. The Konark Sun Temple is located in Odisha.  All four pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall related to recent events and their geographical locations.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    River                               Location of Kumbh Mela
    1. Shipra River                      :   Ujjain
    2. Godavari River                    :   Nashik
    3. Ganges River                     :   Haridwar
    4. Yamuna River                     :   Prayagraj

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kumbh Mela is held at various locations on different rivers.  The Shipra River in Ujjain, the Godavari River in Nashik, and the Ganges River in Haridwar are all correct locations for the Kumbh Mela. However, while the Kumbh Mela takes place at the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers in Prayagraj,  the Yamuna River alone is not a sole location. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of the Kumbh Mela's diverse locations and the ability to differentiate between the correct and incorrect locations.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Core Sector Industry             Description
    1. Automobile                      :  A core sector industry in India
    2. Electricity                      :  Contributes to 40.27% of IIP weight
    3. Fertilizer                       :  One of the eight core industries
    4. Cement                          : A core sector industry in India

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 and 3 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The automobile industry is *not* listed among the eight core sector industries in India.  Electricity is a core sector industry, but its contribution to IIP weight is stated as 40.27%. Fertilizer and cement are both included in the eight core industries. Thus, only statements 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of the automobile industry and the precise IIP weight as distractors tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of India's core sector and industrial production index.




These examples demonstrate the creation of challenging MCQs that require in-depth knowledge and careful analysis, fulfilling all aspects of the prompt.  Remember that the difficulty level is subjective and can vary depending on the candidate's background.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, including factual recall, analysis, and evaluation.  Plausible distractors are included to make the questions more difficult.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                      State/Region of Significant Production
1.  Rapeseed-Mustard                        :   Andhra Pradesh
2.  Sunflower                               :   Tamil Nadu
3.  Sesamum                                  :   Rajasthan
4.  Groundnut                                :   Gujarat
5.  Soybean                                 :   Uttar Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Sesamum is significantly produced in Rajasthan, and Soybean is a major crop in Uttar Pradesh.  The other options contain incorrect pairings.  Rapeseed-Mustard is primarily grown in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, not Andhra Pradesh.  Sunflower cultivation is prominent in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, not Tamil Nadu.  While Gujarat produces groundnuts, it's not the region of *most* significant production.  The question tests factual recall of major crop-producing regions in India.  It uses plausible distractors by including states known for other oilseed crops, making it difficult to answer without precise knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument/Body             Description/Function
1.  Participatory Notes (P-Notes)          :   Used by foreign investors to invest in Indian stock markets without direct SEBI registration.
2.  Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT)   :   Established under the Companies Act, 2013.
3.  Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)      :   Determines the policy interest rate to achieve the inflation target (as per Section 45ZA of the RBI Act, 1934).
4.  NAFED                                   :   Registered under the Indian Cooperative Societies Act.
5.  Dry Port                                :   A seaport located inland.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly matches P-Notes with their function, MPC with its role in determining interest rates to meet inflation targets (although the Act section is slightly incorrect, the function is correct), and NAFED with its registration under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act. The other options include inaccurate statements.  The SAT is established under the SEBI Act, 1992, not the Companies Act.  A dry port is an inland terminal connected to a seaport, not a seaport itself. The question tests knowledge about Indian financial instruments and regulatory bodies. Distractors are carefully chosen to include related but incorrect information about the entities listed, making it a challenging question.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article/Schedule        Subject Matter
1.  Article 39(e)                          :   Right to work
2.  Article 42                             :   Provision for just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief
3.  Article 340                            :   Appointment of a commission to investigate the conditions of backward classes
4.  Sixth Schedule                          :   Administration of tribal areas in four states
5.  Article 243G                           :   Powers of Panchayats

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Article 42 correctly deals with just and humane working conditions and maternity relief. Article 340 accurately relates to the appointment of a commission to investigate the conditions of backward classes. The Sixth Schedule appropriately governs the administration of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Option (a) is incorrect because Article 39(e) deals with equal pay for equal work, not the right to work. Option (c) is incorrect as Article 243G deals with the powers of Panchayats, not directly with the Sixth Schedule. The question tests knowledge of the Indian Constitution.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring precise knowledge of the articles and their content to answer correctly.  This makes it a difficult question.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                            Head/Appointing Authority
1.  NAFED                                   :   Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution
2.  UPSC                                    :   Chief Justice of India
3.  Election Commission of India           :   President of India
4.  NCBC                                   :   Parliament
5.  RBI                                     :   Government of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 5 are correctly matched. The President of India appoints the Election Commissioners, and the Government of India appoints the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.  The other options are incorrect. NAFED falls under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, not the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India, not the Chief Justice. The NCBC is a constitutional body established under Article 338B, not appointed by Parliament. This question tests knowledge of the appointing authorities of various Indian organizations. Distractors are selected to be closely related to the actual appointing authorities, increasing the difficulty level.


**5. With reference to the Indian Textile Industry, consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                 Correctness
1.  India is the largest textile exporter globally. :   Incorrect
2.  The domestic apparel & textile industry contributes approximately 2.3% to India's GDP. :  Correct
3.  India is one of the largest producers of cotton and jute in the world. :  Correct

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched as true and correct respectively.  Statement 1 is incorrectly matched as false because while India is a major textile exporter, it does not hold the largest share of global trade in textiles and apparel. The question tests factual knowledge about the Indian textile industry's contribution to the GDP and its status as a major producer of raw materials.  The distractor is designed to be plausible, requiring specific knowledge about India's global ranking in textile exports.  This makes it a difficult question.


These questions demonstrate the required format and difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and testing various cognitive skills. Remember to replace the example content with your own unique UPSC-style questions following the same structure and criteria.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                      Key Provision/Feature
1.  Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993            :   Established the National Human Rights Commission
2.  The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947       :   Regulates the export of antiquities
3.  42nd Constitutional Amendment, 1976            :   Introduced the concept of Fundamental Duties
4.  73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992        :   Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
5.  Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019     :   Bifurcated Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) as a statutory body to investigate human rights violations.  The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947, aims to regulate and control the export of antiquities from India to preserve its cultural heritage.  The 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976 added Fundamental Duties to the Constitution, aiming to instill a sense of responsibility and duty towards the nation among citizens. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX to the Constitution, establishing Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the village, intermediate, and district levels to decentralize power and governance.  The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019,  abolished the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and reorganized the state into two Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. Option (d) accurately reflects the correct pairings of the Acts/Amendments with their key features.


**2. With reference to the Constitution of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Article                                         Subject Matter
1. Article 124                                     :   Establishment of the Supreme Court
2. Article 312                                     :   Provision for All India Services
3. Article 338                                     :   National Commission for Scheduled Castes
4. Article 370 (as it existed before 2019)       :    Special status of Jammu and Kashmir
5. Article 246                                     :   Distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 124 of the Constitution of India deals with the establishment and constitution of the Supreme Court of India, outlining its composition, powers, and jurisdiction.  Article 312 empowers Parliament to create All India Services (like the IAS, IPS, and IFS) to ensure uniform administration across the country. Article 338, prior to amendment, pertained to the establishment of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Article 370, before its revocation in 2019, granted special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 246 outlines the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States, forming the basis of India's federal structure. All the pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                                    Appointing Authority
1.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)          :   Prime Minister of India
2.  Election Commission of India                       :   President of India
3.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)        :   President of India
4.  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :   President of India
5.  Finance Commission                              :   President of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The President of India appoints the members of the Election Commission of India, the National Human Rights Commission, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, and the Finance Commission. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) members are also appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  The President's role in appointing these constitutional bodies underscores the importance of executive oversight in maintaining the integrity and independence of these crucial institutions.


**4. With reference to the Indian legal system, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                                      Defining Act/Provision
1.  Basic Structure Doctrine                         :   Kesavananda Bharati Case, 1973
2.  Public Interest Litigation (PIL)                 :   Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
3.  Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)            :   Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
4.  Curative Petition                               :   Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
5.  Remission of Sentence                           :   Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Basic Structure Doctrine was established through the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973, which set limits on the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms are largely governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  Remission of sentences is a power granted to the executive under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.  The other options incorrectly link legal concepts to the wrong defining acts or provisions.  The correct pairings highlight the key legal frameworks governing important aspects of Indian law and constitutional interpretation. Option (c) is the only option that correctly identifies the defining legal framework for these concepts.  Option (d) is incorrect as the Code of Civil Procedure is not related to PIL, and the Protection of Human Rights Act is not related to Curative Petitions.  Option (b) misses the correct pairing of Remission of Sentence.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Law                                           Principal Subject Matter
1.  Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878          :   Protection of Endangered Species
2.  Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904     :   Regulation of Online Gaming
3.  The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947   :   Regulation of Foreign Exchange
4.  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972         :   Protection of Cultural Heritage
5.  Public Records Act, 1993                      :   Management of Government Documents

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878, deals with the discovery and ownership of hidden treasure. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, is concerned with the preservation of ancient monuments. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947,  regulates the export of antiquities. The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, protects cultural heritage. The Public Records Act, 1993, manages government documents. Four pairs (1, 3, 4, and 5) are correctly matched. The incorrect pairings highlight the need for precise understanding of the subject matter of various laws.  Option (d) is the only option that accurately reflects the number of correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Order                                  Body/Concept
1. Representation of the People Act, 1951:  Voter Disqualification
2. Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968:  President's Nomination
3. Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993:  State Legislative Assemblies Elections

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Representation of the People Act, 1951, deals with the conduct of elections and includes provisions for voter disqualification based on various grounds like corrupt practices, bribery, and other electoral offences.  The Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, empowers the Election Commission to allocate symbols to political parties, not the President.  The President's role is in the recognition and allocation of symbols to parties, a function delegated to the Election Commission. The President does not directly nominate candidates or parties. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), not related to the conduct of State Legislative Assemblies elections.  The Election Commission of India is the body responsible for conducting elections to the State Legislative Assemblies. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs involving the President's role in symbol allocation and the NHRC's functions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Constitutional Article                     Body/Function
1. Article 338B                           :   Administers elections to the Lok Sabha
2. Article 39(e)                          :   Secures the health of workers
3. Article 243G                           :   Empowers municipalities to strengthen public health

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 338B of the Constitution, inserted by the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018, established the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC). The NCBC's function is to examine and recommend requests for the inclusion or exclusion of communities in the list of Backward Classes, it doesn't administer elections. Article 39(e) of the Directive Principles of State Policy directs the state to secure the health of workers. Article 243G of the Constitution empowers Panchayats and Municipalities to strengthen public health;  municipalities are a specific type of local government, falling under this article.  Option (a) is incorrect as Article 338B does not relate to election administration. Option (c) is incorrect as Article 338B is unrelated to election administration, and Article 243G relates to Panchayats and Municipalities. Option (d) is incorrect because Article 338B is incorrectly linked to election administration.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Order                                  Provision/Power
1. Representation of the People Act, 1950:  Governs the conduct of elections to the Rajya Sabha.
2. Representation of the People Act, 1951: Grants powers to the Election Commission.
3. The Constitution (One Hundred and Second Amendment) Act, 2018:  Introduced Article 340.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Representation of the People Act, 1950, primarily deals with the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies. While it indirectly relates to Rajya Sabha elections through the overall electoral framework, it does not govern the conduct of those elections specifically.  The 1951 Act is more directly involved. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, gives extensive powers to the Election Commission of India regarding the conduct of elections, including registration of political parties and the allocation of election symbols. The 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018, granted constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) by inserting Article 338B, not Article 340. Article 340 relates to the appointment of a commission to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes. Option (a) is incorrect because the 1950 Act's primary focus is on Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assembly elections. Option (c) is incorrect due to the mismatched pairing of the 1950 Act and the 2018 Amendment. Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons stated above.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Body/Official             Responsibility/Function
1. Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS):  Administers oaths to Cabinet Ministers
2. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):  Established under Article 338B
3. National Commission for Women (NCW): Reviews Constitutional and legal safeguards for women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The President, not the CCS, administers the oath of office to the Prime Minister and the Union Cabinet. The CCS is responsible for national security matters, including significant appointments. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not Article 338B (which pertains to the NCBC). The NCW is a statutory body established to review Constitutional and legal safeguards for women, as stated.  Option (a) is incorrect because the CCS does not administer oaths to Cabinet Ministers.  Option (b) is incorrect because the NHRC is not established under Article 338B. Option (d) is incorrect due to the incorrect pairings for the CCS and the NHRC.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) is a constitutional body.
2. The Prime Minister appoints the Chairperson and members of the NCSC.
3. The NCSC can investigate and issue orders like a civil court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Indian Constitution. Statement 2 is incorrect: The President of India appoints the Chairperson and members of the NCSC. Statement 3 is incorrect:  The Delhi High Court has clarified that the NCSC does not have the authority to investigate or issue orders like a civil or criminal court; its powers are primarily advisory.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect statements regarding the appointment authority of the NCSC and its investigative powers.  The NCSC's role is to investigate complaints and make recommendations to the government, not to act as a court.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

Constitutional Article                Commission/Body
1. Article 338                          : National Commission for Backward Classes
2. Article 340                          : National Commission for Scheduled Castes
3. Article 338B                         : National Human Rights Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 338 established the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (NCSC/NCST), not the NCBC. Article 340 provides for the appointment of a commission to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes, leading to the formation of various commissions over time, including the Mandal Commission.  However, the NCBC was established under Article 338B, which was added later. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not under Article 338B. All the pairings are incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**7. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

List in Seventh Schedule               Subject
1. Union List                            :  Public health
2. State List                             : Defence
3. Concurrent List                       :  Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union List contains subjects on which only the Parliament can legislate. Defence is a subject under the Union List.  The State List contains subjects on which only State Legislatures can legislate. Public health falls under the State List. The Concurrent List contains subjects on which both the Parliament and State Legislatures can legislate. Education is a subject under the Concurrent List. Only the pair related to the Concurrent List is correctly matched.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c).


**8. With reference to the oath-taking ceremony in India, consider the following pairs:**

Office                                     Authority Administering Oath
1. President of India                     : Chief Justice of India
2. Chief Ministers of States             : President of India
3. Ministers at the State Level          : Governor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The oath of office to the President of India is administered by the Chief Justice of India.  The Governor administers the oath to Chief Ministers and other Ministers at the state level. The President administers the oath to the Prime Minister and the Union Council of Ministers. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair of Ministers at the State Level and Governor. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair related to the President. Option (d) is incorrect because the Chief Ministers' oath is incorrectly attributed to the President.



**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                              Chairperson/Members Appointment Authority
1. National Commission for Backward Classes: Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and three other members   : Prime Minister
2. National Commission for Women (NCW)   : Chairperson and other members                             : President
3. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC): Chairperson and members                                     : President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCBC consists of a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and three other members. The President appoints the Chairperson and members of the NCBC based on a recommendation by a six-member committee, not the Prime Minister. The NCW is a statutory body, and its Chairperson and members are appointed by the President. The NHRC is also appointed by the President based on a recommendation from a committee.  Only the appointment authority for the NHRC is correctly matched. Therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

Political Party                   Symbol
1. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP):  Clock
2. Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray):  Bow and Arrow
3.  Indian National Congress          : Hand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) uses the clock symbol.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is the authority that recognizes political parties and allocates symbols. Disputes regarding symbols are resolved by the ECI.  While the Bow and Arrow and Hand are symbols used by political parties, they may not necessarily be the correct current symbols for the Shiv Sena and Indian National Congress.  The ECI's decisions on symbol allocation are final, unless challenged and overturned by the Supreme Court.  Only the NCP's symbol is certainly correct. Therefore, only option (a) is correct.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article              Provision Related To
    1. Article 72                        :  Powers of the Governor to grant pardons
    2. Article 161                       :  Powers of the President to grant pardons
    3. Article 137                       :  Review petitions in the Supreme Court
    4. Article 142                       :  Power of the Supreme Court to do complete justice
    5. Article 129                       : The Supreme Court as a Court of Record


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution deals with the power of the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence.  Article 161 grants similar powers to the Governor of a State, but within the limits of the State's executive power. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect, and pair 2 is correct.  Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments.  Articles 142 and 129 relate to the Supreme Court's inherent powers: Article 142 allows the court to do complete justice, and Article 129 declares it a court of record.  Hence, pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Body                  Power/Function
    1.  Parliament                      :  Appoints the Chief Justice of India
    2.  Collegium                       :  Recommends appointments of High Court judges
    3.  Intelligence Bureau             :  Conducts inquiries into candidates for judicial appointments
    4.  President of India               :  Appoints judges to the Supreme Court
    5.  Ministry of Finance              :  Prior consultation for creating posts in Class I or Class II of Parliament Secretariat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The President of India, not Parliament, appoints the Chief Justice of India and other Supreme Court judges (Article 124).  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Collegium system, comprising the Chief Justice of India and other senior judges, recommends appointments to the Supreme Court and High Courts.  The government can conduct inquiries through the Intelligence Bureau for candidates, and the Ministry of Finance requires prior consultation for certain appointments within the Parliament Secretariat. Hence, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Provision                         Key Feature
    1.  Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:  Establishes the Arbitration Council of India
    2.  Consumer Protection Act, 2019     :  Deals with misleading advertisements
    3.  Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 :  Provides for Lok Adalats
    4.  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973   :  Governs the power of the government to remit sentences
    5.  Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993:  Establishes State Human Rights Commissions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, does not establish the Arbitration Council of India; that was established by a later amendment.  The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, indeed deals with misleading advertisements. The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, provides for Lok Adalats as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, grants the government the power to suspend or remit sentences. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), not State Human Rights Commissions. Therefore, pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Remedy                        Applicable to
    1. Curative Petition                  :  Orders passed by High Courts
    2. Review Petition (Article 137)     :  Judgments of the Supreme Court
    3. Appeal to High Court               :  Orders passed by Tribunals
    4. Contempt of Court                  :  Misleading advertisements by FMCG firms
    5. Writ Petition (Article 32)           :  Violation of Fundamental Rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A curative petition is the last resort in the Supreme Court, not for High Court orders. A review petition under Article 137 is indeed applicable to Supreme Court judgments. Appeals from tribunals generally lie with the High Court.  Contempt of court proceedings are not directly related to misleading advertisements, though the Supreme Court *can* use contempt powers to address non-compliance with its orders.  Writ petitions under Article 32 are used to enforce fundamental rights. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.



**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Election Commission of India (ECI):**

1.  The ECI sets election expenditure limits for candidates.
2.  The ECI can conduct re-polling in case of natural calamities or violence.
3.  The ECI provides facilities for home voting for senior citizens above 80 years of age.
4.  The ECI is responsible for the scrutiny of nominations under the Representation of the People Act.
5.  The ECI is responsible for deciding election disputes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for setting election expenditure limits for Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies. The ECI can conduct re-polling in various situations including natural calamities or violence as per the Representation of the People Act. The ECI is involved in the scrutiny of nomination papers submitted by candidates.  However, the Supreme Court, not the ECI, decides election disputes. The ECI introduced home voting for senior citizens above 85 years and those with 40% disability.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.  The questions are designed to be challenging, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall and analytical skills.  Remember, the information presented in the questions is assumed to be factually accurate.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                     Characteristic
1. Uttarakhand                  :   Highest population density in India
2. Himachal Pradesh             :   Lowest population density in India
3. Uttarakhand                  :   Created from Uttar Pradesh
4. Himachal Pradesh             :   Borders Nepal
5. Uttarakhand                  :   Major producer of apples

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because statements 3 and 5 are factually accurate.  Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh, and both Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh are significant apple-producing states in India.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Uttarakhand does not have the highest population density in India; that distinction belongs to another state.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Himachal Pradesh does not have the lowest population density in India; that belongs to another state/UT. Statement 4 is incorrect; Uttarakhand, not Himachal Pradesh, borders Nepal.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Feature          State/UT
1.  Cold Desert                     :   Himachal Pradesh
2.  Valley of Flowers               :   Uttarakhand
3.  Nanda Devi National Park       :   Himachal Pradesh
4.  Gangotri National Park          :   Uttarakhand
5.  Mussoorie Range                 :   Uttarakhand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer.  The Valley of Flowers and Gangotri National Park are both located in Uttarakhand, and the Mussoorie range is also in Uttarakhand.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Himachal Pradesh has cold desert areas, the largest extent of cold desert in India is not solely within its borders. Statement 3 is incorrect; Nanda Devi National Park is in Uttarakhand.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                     Indicator
1. Uttarakhand                  :   High Industrial GSVA
2. Himachal Pradesh             :   High Industrial GSVA
3. Uttarakhand                  :   71% Forest Cover of Geographical Area
4. Himachal Pradesh             :   68% Forest Cover of Geographical Area
5. Uttarakhand                  :   Top Performing UT/State (SDG)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh both have significant forest cover as a percentage of their geographical area, and Uttarakhand has been recognized as a top-performing state/UT in the SDG index.

Statement 1 and 2 are not necessarily always true. While both states show high industrial performance, the relative ranking can vary depending on the specific period and metrics used.


**4. With reference to Uttarakhand, consider the following pairs:**

    Location                       Feature
1. Joshimath                       :   Site of 38th National Games
2. Kedarnath Temple                :   Located in Uttarakhand
3.  Lakhudiyar                       :   Archaeological site with rock paintings
4.  Valley of Flowers               :   Cold Desert
5.  Hemkund Gurudwara              :   Located in Uttarakhand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Kedarnath Temple and Hemkund Gurudwara are both located in Uttarakhand. Lakhudiyar is an archaeological site known for its paintings.

Statement 1 is incorrect; Joshimath is not the site of the 38th National Games. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Valley of Flowers is not a cold desert.


**5. With reference to Himachal Pradesh, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                      Feature
1.  Simla                          :   Capital of Himachal Pradesh
2.  Great Himalayan National Park:   Located in Himachal Pradesh
3.  Pong Dam                       :   Constructed across Beas River
4.  Chandra Taal                    :   Ramsar site in Himachal Pradesh
5.  Kangra Valley                   :   Cold desert area


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  Simla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh. The Great Himalayan National Park and Chandra Taal are both located in Himachal Pradesh, and Pong Dam is built across the Beas River.

Statement 5 is incorrect; while Himachal Pradesh has cold desert areas, the Kangra Valley is not solely a cold desert.  It encompasses diverse geographical features.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                      Capital City
1. Algeria                       Algiers
2. Malawi                        Blantyre
3. Kenya                         Mombasa
4. South Africa                 Cape Town
5. Australia                     Sydney

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Algeria's capital city is correctly matched as Algiers.  Blantyre is the commercial capital of Malawi, but Lilongwe is its administrative capital. Mombasa is a major port city in Kenya, but Nairobi is its capital. Cape Town is a significant city in South Africa, but Pretoria and Bloemfontein are also capitals (Pretoria being the administrative capital).  Sydney is a major city in Australia, but Canberra is its capital city. The question tests factual recall of capital cities, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge in geography and current affairs.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorporate plausible distractors, including major cities often confused with capital cities, thereby increasing the difficulty level.  Option (a) is the only one accurately reflecting the correct capital city pairing.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Bordering Country
1. Algeria                      Tunisia
2. Malawi                       Zambia
3. Kenya                        Somalia
4. South Africa                 Namibia
5. Australia                    Papua New Guinea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Algeria shares a border with Tunisia. Malawi shares a border with Zambia. Kenya shares a border with Somalia. South Africa shares a border with Namibia. Australia shares a maritime border with Papua New Guinea. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international boundaries and geographical locations.  The inclusion of all correct pairs as distractors makes this a difficult question, requiring comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter.  Only option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                  Major Resource/Industry
1. Algeria                   Phosphate mining
2. Malawi                    Tourism
3. Kenya                     Tea production
4. South Africa              Diamond mining
5. Australia                  Gold mining

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs represent a significant industry or resource for each country.  Algeria is a major producer and exporter of hydrocarbons, including natural gas and oil, but phosphate mining is also significant.

(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Hooghly River is a major distributary of the Ganges River that flows through West Bengal.  The Mahanadi River is a major river system primarily located in Odisha. Sambhar Lake is indeed the largest inland salt lake in India, situated in Rajasthan.  Vadhvan Port, under construction in Maharashtra, is planned to be India's largest deep-water port. Finally, the Hasdeo Arand is the largest unfragmented forest in central India, located in Chhattisgarh. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (b) incorrectly includes Chhattisgarh's largest unfragmented forest but excludes the correct matching of Maharashtra's planned largest deep-water port. Option (c) incorrectly includes Vadhvan Port but excludes the correct matchings for West Bengal and Rajasthan. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect pairing of the largest deep-water port with Maharashtra; while Vadhvan is planned to be the largest, it is not yet operational and therefore is not currently the largest.

**Explanation:**

Durga Puja is a major festival celebrated in West Bengal. Rath Yatra is a significant festival associated with Odisha. Gangaur is a prominent festival celebrated in Rajasthan. Gudi Padwa is the state day of Maharashtra.  Chhattisgarh Maati is indeed the state song of Chhattisgarh.  All the pairs presented in option (a) are thus correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings and demonstrate a lack of complete knowledge of the states and associated festivals and state songs.  The inclusion of incorrect pairings in these options serves as effective distractors for the UPSC aspirant.

    1. Atal Pension Yojana (APY)           :    Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
    2. Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) :   Pharma & Medical Bureau of India (PMBI)
    3. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) :    Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI)
    4. Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) :    Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) scheme is implemented by the Pharmaceuticals & Medical Devices Bureau of India (PMBI).  The Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) is implemented by the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).  These two pairings are correct.  However, the other options contain incorrect pairings. The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) is not implemented by LIC; while LIC manages some aspects of pension payouts under PM-SYM which is compatible with APY,  the APY itself is administered by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and other designated banks.  Similarly, while SIDBI plays a role in the MSME sector and might be involved in some aspects of PMMY, the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is not solely implemented by SIDBI; it involves various commercial banks and other lending institutions. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme                      Key Feature
    1. Atal Pension Yojana (APY)           :    Guaranteed minimum monthly pension after age 60
    2. Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) :   Minimum assured pension of Rs. 3000 per month at age 65
    3. Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY)  :   Contribution made by the centre to EPF for 24 months

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) guarantees a minimum monthly pension, but the age of eligibility for the pension is 60, not 65.  The Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) scheme does provide a minimum assured pension of Rs. 3000 per month, but the age of eligibility is 60, not 65.  The Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) correctly reflects that the central government contributes to the EPF for a period of 24 months. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly state the age of pension eligibility or the duration of central government contribution under ABRY.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ministry                                     Scheme
    1. Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers     :    UDAN (Regional Connectivity Scheme)
    2. Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises :   Samarth (Scheme for Capacity Building in Textiles Sector)
    3. Ministry of Civil Aviation                :    Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises is indeed responsible for the Samarth scheme focused on capacity building in the textiles sector.  The other options are incorrect. The UDAN scheme falls under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, not the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers.  The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana is administered by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, not the Ministry of Civil Aviation.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme                       Funding Source/Mechanism
    1. Atal Pension Yojana (APY)           :    Regional Connectivity Fund (RCF)
    2. UDAN (Regional Connectivity Scheme) :   Viability Gap Funding (VGF)
    3. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) :   Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UDAN scheme utilizes Viability Gap Funding (VGF) as a key funding mechanism to incentivize airlines to operate on underserved routes. This pairing is correct.  The other options are incorrect. The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) is funded through contributions from subscribers and matching contributions from the government,  not the Regional Connectivity Fund (RCF). The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) provides loans to micro and small enterprises; its funding comes from various banks and financial institutions, not the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which is primarily associated with telecommunications infrastructure. Therefore, only option 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Organization                 Related Scheme
    1. NITI Aayog                           :    Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK)
    2. Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports  :    Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS)
    3. Ministry of Home Affairs               :    Civil Registration System (CRS) mobile application

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog identifies Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) as a Core of the Core Scheme under the National Development Agenda. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports oversees the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS). The Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for the Civil Registration System (CRS) mobile application. All three pairs are correctly matched.  There are no incorrect matches in this question.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme                     Eligibility Criterion
    1. Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) :   Must be a taxpayer
    2. Atal Pension Yojana (APY)           :    Age between 18 and 40 years
    3. Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) :   Earnings less than Rs. 15,000 per month

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The eligibility criteria for Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) specifically excludes taxpayers.  The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) has an age eligibility criterion of 18 to 40 years. The Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) targets employees with monthly earnings below Rs. 15,000.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Statement 1 is incorrect because PM-SYM explicitly excludes taxpayers.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ministry                                 Associated Technology/Initiative
    1. Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) :   BharatNet
    2. Ministry of Science & Technology     :    BharatGen
    3. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare :    Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Science and Technology launched the BharatGen project, a multimodal large language model initiative.  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare implements the Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY) for tuberculosis patients.  These two pairings are correct. However, BharatNet is associated with the Ministry of Communications, not MeitY. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option 1 is incorrect because BharatNet falls under the Ministry of Communications, not MeitY.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme                                  Beneficiary Group
    1. Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK):   All Farmers
    2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP): Children below 14 years
    3. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY): Fishermen Communities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme targets children below 14 years of age for rehabilitation. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) aims at the socio-economic development of the fishing community.  These two pairings are correct.  However, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) targets minority communities, not all farmers. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Statement 1 is incorrect because PMJVK focuses on minority communities, not all farmers.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Organization                     Scheme Implemented
    1. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare     :    Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)
    2. Ministry of Textiles                        :    Atal Pension Yojana (APY)
    3. Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers :  National Health Mission
    4. Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA)           :    Samarth Scheme

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY),  Ayushman Bharat, is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  This is a well-established fact. The other options present incorrect pairings. The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) falls under the purview of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), not the Ministry of Textiles.  The National Health Mission is a large umbrella program implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Department of Pharmaceuticals. Finally, the Samarth Scheme is a skill development program under the Ministry of Textiles, not the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The distractors are designed to confuse the candidate by using ministries and schemes that are related to health, welfare, and social security, creating plausible but ultimately incorrect connections.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Ministry                       Policy/Program
    1. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare   :   National Action Plan on Heat Related Illness (NAP-HRI)
    2. Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers   :   Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)
    3. Ministry of Textiles                      :    Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Textiles
    4. Ministry of Finance (MOF)               :    Samarth Scheme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for public health initiatives, including the release of policies like the National Action Plan on Heat Related Illness (NAP-HRI). The Ministry of Textiles oversees schemes aimed at boosting the textile sector, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Textiles.  The other options contain incorrect pairings. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is managed by the Ministry of Finance, not the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers.  The Samarth Scheme is a skill development initiative under the Ministry of Textiles, not the Ministry of Finance.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The distractors are carefully chosen to exploit potential confusion regarding the roles of different ministries in economic and social welfare policies.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Organization                      Document/Regulation
    1. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare     :    Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023
    2. Ministry of Home Affairs                   :    Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024
    3. Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA)           :    National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) 2016
    4. Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises:  National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) 2022

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for releasing public health policies, including the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023. The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) is the government body that launched the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) in 2016. The other options are incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, would likely fall under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare or a related ministry, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) 2022 is a document related to healthcare and pharmaceuticals, making the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare a more likely implementing body than the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 show accurate pairings.  The incorrect options include plausible distractors that could confuse candidates unfamiliar with the specific responsibilities of each ministry.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Program              Implementing/Managing Ministry
    1. Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) : Ministry of Minority Affairs
    2. Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS)  : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
    3. Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana (ABVKY) : Ministry of Labour and Employment
    4. Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) : Ministry of Panchayati Raj


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) is a scheme focused on the socio-economic development of minority communities and is implemented by the Ministry of Minority Affairs.  The Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) aim to provide quality education to Scheduled Tribe children and are managed by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana (ABVKY) provides social security benefits to employees under the Employees' State Insurance (ESI) scheme and is implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The incorrect option is 4, because the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), a poverty alleviation program, is not managed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. While Panchayats play a role in its implementation at the grassroots level, the overall management and coordination reside with the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The distractor in option 4 utilizes a ministry closely related to rural development, making it a convincing yet incorrect choice.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions on the East Asia Summit (EAS), adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires accurate factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     EAS Participation Role
1.  India                       Active participant & Dialogue Partner with ASEAN
2.  China                       Member,  Dialogue Partner with ASEAN
3.  Japan                        Member, ASEAN Plus Three participant
4.  Australia                   Member, Dialogue Partner with ASEAN
5.  New Zealand                Member,  Dialogue Partner with ASEAN

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(b) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  India is a full member of the EAS and also engages with ASEAN as a dialogue partner, reflecting its significant role in the region.  China is similarly a member of EAS and a dialogue partner with ASEAN. Japan is a member of EAS and also a key player in ASEAN Plus Three mechanisms. Australia and New Zealand are both members of the EAS and maintain dialogue partner status with ASEAN, emphasizing their involvement in regional affairs.  Therefore, option (a) accurately represents the correct matching of all five pairs.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  A comprehensive understanding of the EAS membership and ASEAN's relationship with its dialogue partners is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    ASEAN Member State          First EAS Meeting Location
1.  Indonesia                     Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
2.  Singapore                     Vientiane, Laos PDR
3.  Thailand                      Jakarta, Indonesia
4.  Philippines                   Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei
5.  Vietnam                       Naypyidaw, Myanmar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The first East Asia Summit (EAS) was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2005.  While all the countries listed in the pairs are ASEAN member states and thus members of the EAS, the locations listed in pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect as the locations of subsequent EAS meetings.  Understanding the historical context of the EAS's establishment and the location of its first meeting is crucial for correctly answering this question.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge of ASEAN member states and locations of various summits, making it a challenging question.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Country              Relationship with ASEAN
1.  India                 Founding Member
2.  China                 Dialogue Partner
3.  Japan                 ASEAN Plus Three Participant
4.  Australia              Trade Partner
5.  New Zealand          Strategic Partner


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  China is a dialogue partner with ASEAN, engaging in various political and economic dialogues.  Japan is a participant in the ASEAN Plus Three mechanism, a significant cooperative arrangement.  The other pairs are incorrect: India is not a founding member of ASEAN;  while Australia and New Zealand are trade and dialogue partners, they are not exclusively categorized as only trade or strategic partners with ASEAN; their relationship is multi-faceted. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the nuances of ASEAN's relationships with different countries, requiring a deeper understanding than simple factual recall.


**4. With reference to the East Asia Summit (EAS), consider the following pairs:**

   Year                     Significant Event
1.  2005                     First EAS meeting in Kuala Lumpur
2.  2009                     ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) signed
3.  2010                     India upgraded relations with ASEAN to a strategic partnership
4.  2011                     Russia and the USA joined the EAS
5.  2014                     FIPIC (Forum for India–Pacific Islands Cooperation) launched


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The first EAS meeting took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2005; the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) was signed in 2009; India elevated its relationship with ASEAN to a strategic partnership in 2010; and Russia and the USA joined the EAS in 2011. However, the FIPIC initiative was launched in 2014, not directly as an EAS event.  This question assesses the candidate's ability to accurately recall key events in the history of the EAS and its related initiatives, demonstrating an understanding of the timeline of regional cooperation.  The distractors include plausible yet incorrect dates, making it a demanding question.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                      Headquarters Location
1.  ASEAN                          Jakarta, Indonesia
2.  ADB                             Manila, Philippines
3.  SCO                             Beijing, China
4.  FATF                            Lyon, France
5.  INTERPOL                        Paris, France


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  ASEAN's secretariat is in Jakarta, Indonesia; the ADB's headquarters are in Manila, Philippines; and the SCO's headquarters are in Beijing, China.  The headquarters of FATF and INTERPOL are incorrectly stated in the question; FATF's headquarters are in Paris, France, and INTERPOL's headquarters are in Lyon, France. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the locations of various international organizations, requiring precise factual recall.  The incorrect options present plausible alternative locations, making it a challenging question.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    1. China                       :  Kublai Khan
    2. India                        :  Ashoka the Great
    3. Afghanistan                 :  Amanullah Khan
    4. Iran                         :  Shah Abbas II
    5.  Russia                      : Peter the Great


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs represent correct matches between a geographical location and a historically significant figure associated with that location. Kublai Khan was a significant ruler of China, belonging to the Yuan dynasty. Ashoka the Great was a prominent emperor of the Mauryan dynasty in India. Amanullah Khan was a significant Amir (ruler) of Afghanistan. Shah Abbas II ruled over the Safavid dynasty in Iran during a period of relative stability and prosperity. Peter the Great was a major Tsar who significantly modernized and expanded Russia.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  A comprehensive understanding of historical figures and their geographical contexts is crucial to answer this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                       Major Export Commodity
    1. China                        :  Raw Silk
    2. India                         :  Spices
    3. Russia                        :  Crude Oil
    4. Brazil                        :  Coffee
    5. Egypt                        : Natural Gas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly link a country with a major export commodity. China is a major exporter of raw silk, a product deeply intertwined with its history and culture. India's rich biodiversity and agricultural tradition have made spices a significant export. Russia is a leading exporter of crude oil, a crucial component of its energy sector. Brazil is renowned globally for its coffee exports, a major contributor to its economy.  Egypt is a significant exporter of natural gas, benefiting from its substantial reserves.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched ones.  Knowledge of global trade patterns and major commodity producers is essential for answering this question.


**3. With reference to major international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                     Headquarters Location
    1. ASEAN                          : Jakarta, Indonesia
    2. BRICS                           : Shanghai, China
    3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation:  Beijing, China
    4. Asian Development Bank       : Manila, Philippines
    5. Interpol                       : Lyon, France


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the headquarters of various international organizations. Options 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's headquarters are in Beijing, China. The Asian Development Bank is headquartered in Manila, Philippines. Interpol's headquarters is in Lyon, France. Option 1 is incorrect; ASEAN's secretariat is in Jakarta, but its headquarters are not formally located in a single city. Option 2 is incorrect; BRICS does not have a permanent secretariat or headquarters. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair of ASEAN and Jakarta, Indonesia.


**4. With reference to India's foreign policy, consider the following pairs:**

2. Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants : Control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes
3. Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure : Regulation of specific hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade
4. Basel Convention                           :   Reduction of mercury air emissions from coal-fired power plants

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Minamata Convention on Mercury specifically addresses the phase-out of mercury in various products, including dental amalgam.  Option 1 correctly reflects this focus. The Rotterdam Convention is indeed concerned with regulating specific hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade through a prior informed consent procedure, making option 3 accurate.  The Basel Convention primarily focuses on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, not the regulation of specific chemicals like the Rotterdam Convention.  Option 4 is therefore incorrect. The Stockholm Convention deals with Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), not specifically with the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, although it indirectly contributes to that goal;  the Basel Convention has a more direct and primary focus on transboundary movements of hazardous wastes. Thus option 2 is also incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                 Activity/Initiative

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The WHO is indeed a key player in the global fight against tuberculosis and has actively promoted the "Find. Treat. All. #EndTB" campaign.  The FSSAI is responsible for regulating food safety and standards in India, including the implementation of regulations related to fortified food products like rice. The IAEA plays a crucial role in nuclear safety and security, and the ITDB is one of its key initiatives for tracking incidents and trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive materials.  The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) develops international food standards, not national policies for rare diseases. Therefore, option 4 is incorrect.  The development of a National Policy for Rare Diseases falls under the purview of a national government, not the international CAC.  Only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Chemical/Substance                         Regulation/Convention

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Endosulfan is listed under the Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, not the Minamata Convention which focuses on Mercury.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. The WHO has indeed identified mercury as a chemical of major public health concern. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in India deals with issues related to air pollution, including the regulation of pollutants like pet coke. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans. Options 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  Only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The red panda is indeed the state animal of Sikkim.  Himachal Pradesh also correctly lists the snow leopard as its state animal. However, the other options present incorrect pairings.  Arunachal Pradesh's state animal is the Mishmi Takin, not the Mithun, although Mithun is an important animal in the state's culture.  The Asiatic Lion is the state animal of Gujarat, but the pairing with West Bengal is incorrect; West Bengal's state animal is the Royal Bengal Tiger. Therefore, only Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh have correctly matched state animals in the given pairs.  The question tests factual recall of state animals in India, demanding precise knowledge beyond general awareness. The distractors are carefully chosen to include animals closely associated with the states but not officially designated as state animals.

    2. Species Selection                                 Use of native, fast-growing species
    3. Maintenance Requirements                         High maintenance required
    4. Spatial Scale                                     Large areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Miyawaki method is characterized by the selection of native, fast-growing species suitable for the specific location.  Options 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The Miyawaki method emphasizes high-density planting, aiming for rapid forest growth.  It is known for requiring minimal maintenance after establishment, and it is designed for small-scale afforestation projects within urban or limited spaces, not large areas. The question tests the candidate's understanding of a specific afforestation technique, requiring detailed knowledge of its principles and practices. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the Miyawaki method and other afforestation approaches.


**11. With reference to Tardigrades, consider the following pairs:**

    2. Unique Respiratory System                           Internal oxygen generation
    3. Anaerobic Respiration                                Exclusive reliance on anaerobic processes
    4.  Dehydration Tolerance                              Revival after years of desiccation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Tardigrades' remarkable ability to survive extreme conditions is primarily due to cryptobiosis, a state of suspended animation where they can survive desiccation (dehydration) and revive after years without sustenance. The other options are incorrect. Tardigrades do not photosynthesize; they are heterotrophs. They don't have a unique respiratory system that allows for internal oxygen generation; their respiration is dependent on environmental oxygen. While they can utilize anaerobic respiration under certain conditions, it's not their exclusive means of survival.

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is not published by the World Food Programme; it's published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index is correctly attributed to the World Bank.  The Emissions Gap Report is published by the UNEP, not the IUCN. This question tests the candidate's awareness of various development and environmental indices and their publishing bodies.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as wrongly attributing the GHI and Emissions Gap Report to the wrong organizations, makes the question challenging.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one wrongly matched pair.  The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is used extensively in precision agriculture, including optimizing fertilizer usage based on real-time soil analysis and crop needs. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing holds immense potential for enhancing crop characteristics such as pest and disease resistance. MicroRNA research is leading to the development of strategies to improve disease resistance in crops. Remote sensing satellite constellations are not directly used for precision irrigation; rather, the data they provide informs irrigation decisions. IoT devices in agriculture mainly collect data which can be used by AI for yield prediction, but IoT itself isn't directly responsible for the prediction.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 demonstrate a direct and accurate technological application in agriculture, making (b) the correct answer.

    3. Welthungerhilfe                             :  Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
    4.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) : Rome Declaration on Water Scarcity in Agriculture

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is jointly published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI).  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect.  The Rome Declaration on Water Scarcity in Agriculture was adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Global Framework on Water Scarcity in Agriculture (WASAG), not the UNDP. The Hand-in-Hand Investment Forum is a flagship program of the FAO, not Concern Worldwide. Lastly,  Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe jointly publish the Global Hunger Index, not the MPI.  Understanding the specific roles and publications of these organizations is crucial for accurate pairing.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to differentiate between closely related organizations and their respective outputs.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, making the question challenging.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index                                          Publishing Organization(s)
    1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                    :  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)                :  Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)
    3. State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI)         :  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
    4. Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI)     :  Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. The other options are incorrect due to mismatched pairings.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not OPHI. The State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI) is developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), not the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).  The FAO does not publish the GHI; it publishes other reports related to food and agriculture. This question tests factual recall and the ability to accurately associate indices with their respective publishers, demanding precise knowledge of international organizations and their work. The inclusion of plausible distractors like BIS (related to standards) and OPHI (related to poverty) enhances the difficulty level.


**3. With reference to international organizations and their initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Initiative
    1. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)      :  Integrated Drylands Development Programme (IDDP)
    2. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) :  Hand-in-Hand Initiative
    3.  World Food Programme (WFP)                :  Sustainable nitrogen management in Agrifood Systems


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Integrated Drylands Development Programme (IDDP) is launched by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because the Hand-in-Hand Initiative is a flagship program of the FAO, not the UNDP, and the WFP does not directly implement the sustainable nitrogen management initiative; it's more likely a collaborative effort with FAO. The question tests factual recall and the ability to correctly link international organizations to their specific initiatives.  The distractors are carefully designed to test the candidate's in-depth understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each organization, making the question challenging and evaluating conceptual understanding and application.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                       International Organization/Treaty
    1. India                                        :  International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA)
    2. Pakistan                                     :  International Coffee Organization (ICO)
    3.  Somalia                                     :  Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
    4. South Korea                                 :  Global Framework on Water Scarcity in Agriculture (WASAG)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) is administered by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and India is a signatory and participant in this treaty.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The other pairs are incorrect.  Pakistan is not directly associated with the International Coffee Organization (ICO) in the primary manner suggested by the pair. Somalia's primary involvement in international environmental agreements is through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) but not exclusively.  South Korea's involvement with WASAG is not in the primary manner implied by the question.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to correctly identify a country's participation in specific international organizations and treaties. The distractors utilize plausible but ultimately incorrect links between countries and international bodies, raising the difficulty level.


**5. With reference to international organizations and their reports, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Report
    1. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)     :  Human Development Report (HDR)
    2. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) : Living Planet Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Human Development Report (HDR) is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the FAO. The Living Planet Report is published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), not the UNDP. The Sand and Dust Storms (SDS) report is published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the WWF. This question tests factual recall of the reports published by major international organizations.  The distractors are strategically placed to test the candidate's knowledge and understanding of the work of these organizations, making the question difficult and assessing factual recall and analytical skills.  The candidates need to accurately recall the publisher of each report.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Prize                                           Recipient(s)
    1. Nobel Prize in Physics                        : Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson
    2. Nobel Peace Prize 2024                       : John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton
    3. Nobel Prize in Literature 2024                : Hibakusha (Nihon Hidankyo)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Nobel Peace Prize 2024 was awarded to Hibakusha (Nihon Hidankyo), a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors. Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect. The Nobel Prize in Physics 2024 was awarded to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton for their work on artificial neural networks, not the individuals listed in option 1.  Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, not Physics. This question tests factual recall concerning Nobel Prize recipients and their fields of achievement.  The distractors involve Nobel laureates but are deliberately mismatched to their awards to test the candidate's precise knowledge, demanding high-level recall and analytical abilities.



**7. Consider the following statements:**

    1. The Gurdwara Act of 1925 grants the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) authority to manage Sikh religious affairs and institutions.
    2. The SGPC is a democratically elected body with members elected by Sikh voters.
    3. The SGPC was established primarily to provide modern technology and financial support to Sikh religious institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The SGPC operates under the Gurdwara Act of 1925, which grants it the authority to manage Sikh religious affairs. The SGPC is also a democratically elected body. Statement 3 is incorrect. The primary reason for the SGPC's creation was to wrest control of Sikh religious institutions from corrupt mahants appointed by the British colonial government, not to provide modern technology and financial support.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between the primary and secondary goals of a historical organization. The distractor in statement 3 is a plausible but incorrect assertion about the SGPC's founding purpose, increasing the difficulty level. The question assesses both factual knowledge and analytical skills.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Marburg virus:**

    1. The Marburg virus was first identified in 1967 during an outbreak in Marburg, Germany, and Belgrade, Serbia.
    2. The virus is highly contagious.
    3.  The virus primarily affects agricultural produce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Marburg virus was first identified in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg, Germany, and Belgrade, Serbia. The virus is also highly contagious. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Marburg virus is a zoonotic virus; it primarily affects humans and animals, not agricultural produce. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of a viral disease.  The distractor in statement 3 presents a plausible but incorrect association of the virus with agricultural sectors, requiring the candidate to demonstrate precise knowledge of virology and epidemiology to answer correctly.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                   Role/Function
    1. World Federation for Mental Health (WFMH) :  Publishes the Human Development Report
    2.  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)    :  Observes World Mental Health Day
    3.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP):  Observes World Mental Health Day


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Human Development Report (HDR) is published by the UNDP, not the WFMH.  World Mental Health Day is observed annually on October 10th and is first initiated by the World Federation for Mental Health (WFMH), not the FAO or UNDP. The FAO and UNDP have their own distinct mandates and do not have the primary role in observing World Mental Health Day. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles of different international organizations, requiring precise knowledge and analytical skills to differentiate between closely related functions. The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s specific knowledge of the roles of the organizations involved.


**10. With reference to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    1. Sustainable nitrogen management in Agrifood Systems:  Achieving SDGs 1, 2, and 10
    2. Hand-in-Hand Initiative                      :  Managing Sand and Dust Storms
    3. Rome Declaration on Water Scarcity in Agriculture : Addressing water scarcity exacerbated by climate crisis


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Rome Declaration directly addresses water scarcity worsened by climate change.  The Hand-in-Hand initiative focuses on achieving SDGs 1 (poverty eradication), 2 (zero hunger), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Pair 2 is incorrect. The Hand-in-Hand initiative does not primarily focus on sand and dust storm management; that's a separate area of FAO's work. This question tests the ability to link FAO initiatives to their specific objectives. The distractor in pair 2 involves a related environmental issue but is a different FAO initiative. The question assesses both factual knowledge and the ability to analyze the focus areas of different initiatives.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided knowledge base, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization              Specific Action/Initiative
1. WHO                         :  Declared India polio-free
2. UN General Assembly      : Established World Cotton Day
3. Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) : Released the Gujarat Declaration

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The WHO did indeed declare India polio-free, marking a significant milestone in global public health.  Exit International is correctly paired with the development of the Sarco pod, a controversial euthanasia machine. Option (b) is incorrect because the UN General Assembly did not establish World Cotton Day; that initiative originated from the Cotton Four nations (Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad, and Mali). Option (c) repeats the correct pairing of 1 and 4, adding nothing new. Option (d) is incorrect as the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) released the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), not the Gujarat Declaration; the source of the Gujarat Declaration is not specified in the provided text.  The question tests factual recall of specific organizations and their actions, requiring precise knowledge to avoid the plausible distractors.

(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The WHO provides information and guidelines on Marburg virus. Egypt's achievement of "gold tier" status in the elimination of Hepatitis C is a verifiable fact.

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately link the organization or institution to its specific report or publication.  The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) released the State of India’s Birds 2023 Report.

This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various institutions and their publications, demanding precise recall.  The options are carefully crafted to include plausible distractors, making simple guessing unlikely.



**5. With reference to the  International Day of Older Persons, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail
1.  Commemorated on                       :  October 7th
2.  Originated from                         :  Vienna International Plan of Action on Aging
3.  Established by                           :  UN General Assembly Resolution 45/106
4.  Theme for 2024                         :  “Ageing with Dignity: The Importance of Strengthening Care and Support Systems for Older Persons Worldwide”


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The International Day of Older Persons is commemorated on October 1st, not October 7th (which is World Cotton Day).  The other three pairs are correctly matched. The idea originated from the Vienna International Plan of Action on Aging. The UN General Assembly formally established October 1st as the International Day of Older Persons through Resolution 45/106. The theme for 2024 is correctly stated. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific details related to the International Day of Older Persons, including its date and origin, requiring precise knowledge to select the correct option amidst plausible distractors.  The incorrect date serves as a strong distractor.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sufi Order          Founder
1. Chishti             :   Baba Farid
2. Suhrawardi         :   Sheikh Bahauddin Zakariya
3. Qadri               :   Sheikh Abdul Qadir Gilani
4. Naqshbandi         :   Khwaja Bahauddin Naqshband Bukhari

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct pairings are 3 and 4. Sheikh Abdul Qadir Gilani founded the Qadri order, and Khwaja Bahauddin Naqshband Bukhari founded the Naqshbandi order.  Option (a) is incorrect because Baba Farid was associated with the Chishti order, but he is not considered its founder; Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti is widely regarded as the founder who significantly shaped the Chishti order's character in India. Option (b) is partially correct regarding Sheikh Bahauddin Zakariya's association with the Suhrawardi order; however, he is also not the founder. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the founders of Chishti and Suhrawardi orders.  Understanding the lineage and key figures within each Sufi order is crucial for comprehending the dissemination of Sufi thought and practice across different regions. The question tests factual recall of Sufi orders and their founders, demanding precise knowledge beyond general awareness.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Dynasty           Significant Buddhist Monument

2. Gupta             :   Mahabodhi Temple
3. Kushana           :   Kanishka Stupa
4. Satavahana       :   Sanchi Stupa

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct pairings are 2 and 3. The Gupta dynasty is associated with the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, and the Kushana dynasty is linked to the Kanishka Stupa at Peshawar. While the Mauryan dynasty was crucial in the early development of Buddhism and the Sanchi Stupa, Ashoka's patronage doesn't exclusively define the Stupa's development; subsequent dynasties also contributed significantly. The Satavahanas expanded and embellished the Sanchi Stupa, but the Mauryas initiated its construction. The question tests the understanding of the patronage of different dynasties towards Buddhist architecture and demands precise knowledge of the association between specific dynasties and monuments.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Author              Book
1. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar :   Annihilation of Caste
2. Mahatma Gandhi     :   My Experiments with Truth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar authored "Annihilation of Caste," a critical work addressing the caste system. Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography is titled "My Experiments with Truth." Jawaharlal Nehru's "Towards Freedom" is a collection of his writings during the Indian freedom struggle.  This question tests factual recall of prominent Indian authors and their significant works.  Knowing these pairings is important for understanding the intellectual landscape of the Indian freedom struggle and the social reform movements.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct matches are 3 and 4. Jahangir oversaw the construction of Akbar's tomb, and Aurangzeb is known for commissioning the Jama Masjid in Delhi. Humayun's association with Agra Fort is complex; he built parts of it, but it was significantly expanded by Akbar. Akbar did not construct the white marble dome of the Ajmer Sharif Dargah; that was done during the reign of Humayun's father, Babur. The question tests the knowledge of Mughal architecture and the contributions of various emperors.  It requires precise understanding of who commissioned which structures, demanding more than just general knowledge of Mughal history.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Abanindranath Tagore received the Padma Shri, and Benode Behari Mukherjee received the Padma Bhushan. Raja Ravi Varma received the Padma Bhushan, not the Padma Vibhushan. Nandalal Bose, while a highly acclaimed artist, did not receive the Bharat Ratna. The question tests the knowledge of awards and recognitions bestowed upon significant figures in Indian art.  It assesses factual recall of specific awards received by these artists, going beyond general knowledge of their artistic contributions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Festival             State/Tribe
1. Hornbill Festival   :   Arunachal Pradesh
2. Hornbill Festival   :   Angami Tribe

The Hornbill festival is primarily celebrated in Nagaland, not Arunachal Pradesh. The Ambubachi Mela is celebrated in Assam, not Tripura. The question assesses the understanding of Indian festivals and their geographical and tribal associations; it requires precise knowledge of the states and tribes associated with these specific festivals.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The Eklingji Temple was indeed the coronation site of Mewar kings.  The Ajmer Sharif Dargah is a significant Sufi shrine, but it is not connected to the spiritual or administrative seat of the Mewar kingdom. The Sanchi Stupa is a significant Buddhist monument, not a pilgrimage site linked to the Nath sect. The question tests knowledge about the religious and historical significance of different temples and monuments in India.  It requires precise knowledge of the specific historical context and significance of each site.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Last Governor-General of India    Highest Civilian Award Recipient
1. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan       :   Bharat Ratna

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Subramania Bharati is indeed known for his collection of patriotic poems, "Swadesa Geethangal."  While Rabindranath Tagore and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay were both significant figures in Indian literature and the freedom struggle,  "Gitanjali" is a collection of Tagore's poems, but not specifically patriotic, and "Anand Math" is a novel by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, not a collection of poems. The question tests knowledge of Indian literature and the freedom struggle, focusing on the specific works of these figures. It demands knowledge beyond general awareness of their literary contributions.

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Vallabhbhai Patel did preside over the Karachi session of the Indian National Congress. Mahatma Gandhi presided over the Belgaum session, not the Belagavi session. Motilal Nehru did not preside over the Nagpur session. The question tests knowledge of the Indian National Congress sessions and their presidents.  It requires precise knowledge of the historical context of specific sessions.

He is also considered the founder of the Chishti Order.  The question tests knowledge of Sufi saints and their historical context.  It demands precise knowledge of the associations and titles connected to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided data, focusing on Humayun and Akbar,  with detailed explanations.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test various cognitive skills, including factual recall, analysis, and evaluation.  Note that the questions do not explicitly mention their source.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mughal Emperor          Action/Territory
1. Humayun                :  Conquered Bengal
2. Akbar                   : Ruled from Agra
3. Humayun                : Built Dinpanah
4. Akbar                   : Conquered Khandesh
5. Humayun                :  Lost Malwa


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Humayun did conquer Bengal, Akbar ruled from Agra, and Humayun did build Dinpanah as a new city. Akbar also conquered Khandesh.  Humayun lost Malwa to Sher Shah Suri.


Option (a) is incorrect because while Humayun did conquer Bengal and build Dinpanah, he did not rule from Agra.  His primary base was Delhi and Kabul.

Option (c) is incorrect because while Humayun built Dinpanah and Akbar conquered Khandesh, Humayun did not conquer Bengal initially; it was later retaken by Akbar.

Option (d) is incorrect because although Akbar ruled from Agra and lost Malwa, Humayun did not lose Malwa to Sher Shah Suri.  Akbar recaptured it.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mughal Emperor           Significant Event/Policy
1. Humayun                 : Implementation of the Mansabdari System
2. Akbar                    :  Abolished Jizya tax
3. Humayun                 :  Sought support from Sindh
4. Akbar                    :  Patron of Tansen
5. Humayun                 :  Defeated at Chausa


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer. Humayun did seek support from Sindh during his exile. Akbar was a well-known patron of the musician Tansen. Humayun suffered a significant defeat at the Battle of Chausa against Sher Shah Suri.  The Mansabdari system was a key administrative reform implemented by Akbar, not Humayun.  While Akbar did abolish the Jizya tax at certain points during his reign, its abolition wasn't a consistent or singular event throughout his rule.


Option (a) is incorrect because the Mansabdari System was primarily associated with Akbar's reign.

Option (b) is incorrect because while Akbar abolished the Jizya tax and was a patron of Tansen, these were not his only significant acts.

Option (d) is incorrect because while Akbar abolished the Jizya tax and Humayun suffered defeat at Chausa, the support sought from Sindh was primarily by Humayun, not Akbar.


**3. Consider the following statements:**

1. Humayun's tomb is located in Delhi.
2. The Akbari Masjid was constructed during Akbar’s reign.
3.  Nandalal Bose designed the emblem of the Padma Shri award.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. Humayun's tomb, a magnificent architectural structure, is indeed located in Delhi. The Akbari Masjid, a significant mosque, was built during the reign of Emperor Akbar.  Nandalal Bose, a pioneer of modern Indian art, is credited with designing the emblems for prestigious awards, including the Padma Shri.


**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire, consider the following pairs:**

   Mughal Emperor        Architectural Structure
1. Humayun                :  Agra Fort
2. Akbar                   :  Humayun's Tomb
3. Jahangir                :  Moti Masjid
4. Akbar                   :  Ibadat Khana
5. Shah Jahan             :  Jama Masjid


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Akbar oversaw the construction of Humayun's Tomb, Akbar established the Ibadat Khana for religious discussions, and Shah Jahan is famously associated with the Jama Masjid in Delhi.  Agra Fort was primarily associated with Akbar's expansions and improvements, although its origins predate his reign.  The Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) is associated with the reign of Aurangzeb, not Jahangir.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                      Award Received
1. C. Rajagopalachari          : Padma Vibhushan
2. Nandalal Bose              : Padma Vibhushan
3. Subramania Bharati         : Bharat Ratna


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Nandalal Bose was a recipient of the Padma Vibhushan. C. Rajagopalachari received the Bharat Ratna, not the Padma Vibhushan. Subramania Bharati did not receive any of these awards.  The Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian award in India, while the Padma Vibhushan is the second highest.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Satyagraha              Leader
1. Vaikom Satyagraha       : Mahatma Gandhi
2. Kheda Satyagraha        : Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel led the Kheda Satyagraha.  The Vaikom Satyagraha was primarily led by K. Kelappan and T. K. Madhavan, while Mahatma Gandhi offered support.  The Bardoli Satyagraha was led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, not T. K. Madhavan.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                  Prominent Figure
1. Dandi March                     :  Tansen

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Dandi March was led by Mahatma Gandhi.  The Vaikom Satyagraha was led by K. Kelappan and T.K. Madhavan. The Kakori conspiracy was planned by Rajendra Nath Lahiri, among others. Tansen was a musician in Akbar's court; Nandalal Bose was an artist.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Location                       Historical Significance
1. Lothal                         :  Durgadi Fort
2. Kisama Heritage Village       : Hornbill Festival
3. Kailashpuri                     : Eklingji Temple

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Kisama Heritage Village is the location of the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland. Kailashpuri is the location of the Eklingji Temple in Rajasthan. Lothal is known for its historical significance as an Indus Valley Civilization site, not for its association with the Durgadi Fort which is located in Maharashtra.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                     Action/Legislation
1. Chaudhary Charan Singh : Introduced the Zamindari Abolition Act
2. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel  : Introduced the Debt Redemption Bill (1939)
3. Jawaharlal Nehru          : Spearheaded the Green Revolution
4.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar       : Authored the Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a crucial role in the integration of princely states into the Indian Union after Independence. He wasn't directly involved in introducing the Debt Redemption Bill of 1939, which was primarily associated with Chaudhary Charan Singh.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** While Chaudhary Charan Singh was a strong advocate for farmers' rights and land reforms, including Zamindari abolition, he didn't *introduce* the Zamindari Abolition Act.  The specific legislation varied across states and was enacted by different state governments.  Attributing it solely to him is inaccurate.

* **Pair 3:** Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister during the Green Revolution, but it wasn't solely his initiative. The Green Revolution was a complex process involving multiple factors like technological advancements in agricultural practices, infrastructure development (irrigation), and government policies.

* **Pair 4:** Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was instrumental in drafting the Indian Constitution, but he didn't author a singular "Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms."  The Constitution was the culmination of extensive deliberations and contributions from various individuals and groups.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Area                  Specific Policy/Act
1. Land Reforms                 :  The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act
2.  Economic Reforms           :  The Right to Information Act
3.  Social Justice               :  The Debt Redemption Bill (1939)
4. Agricultural Productivity    :  The Ninth Schedule of the Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with land reforms by including laws related to land reforms, protecting them from judicial review.  The Debt Redemption Bill (1939), primarily associated with Chaudhary Charan Singh, aimed to alleviate rural debt and improve the socio-economic conditions of marginal and small farmers, falling under the broader category of land reforms and social justice.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) primarily focuses on rural employment and livelihood security, not directly land reforms.

* **Pair 2:** The Right to Information Act is a cornerstone of transparency and accountability, primarily associated with social justice and good governance, not economic reforms in the conventional sense (like liberalization).


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator         Factor Affecting It
1. Agricultural Productivity :  The Sarvodaya Plan
2. Agricultural Productivity :  Climate Change
3. Agricultural Productivity :  Farm Mechanization
4. Agricultural Productivity :  The Coastal Shipping Bill (2024)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Climate change significantly impacts agricultural productivity through changes in rainfall patterns, temperature increases, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Farm mechanization enhances agricultural productivity through increased efficiency and reduced labor costs. The other pairs are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** The Sarvodaya Plan is a philosophical and socio-economic plan emphasizing Gandhian ideals of self-sufficiency and social justice. While it indirectly relates to rural development, its direct impact on *measurable* agricultural productivity is tenuous and not a primary focus.

* **Pair 4:** The Coastal Shipping Bill (2024) is unrelated to agricultural productivity. It focuses on improving coastal shipping efficiency and logistics.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Personality                Association
1.  Chaudhary Charan Singh: Bharat Ratna recipient
2.  Udham Singh             : Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) member
3.  Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti:  Garib Nawaz
4.  Alluri Sitarama Raju    :  Manyam Rebellion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct.  All four pairs are correctly matched. Chaudhary Charan Singh was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna. Udham Singh was a member of the HSRA. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti earned the title "Garib Nawaz" (friend of the poor). Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion (also known as the Manyam Rebellion).  There are no incorrect matches in this set.


**5. With reference to Indian History and Politics, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Movement                     Year
1.  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre       : 1919
2.  The Rampa Rebellion              : 1932
3.  The Mahad Satyagraha            : 1927
4.  Formation of All India Kisan Sabha: 1936

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred in 1919. The Mahad Satyagraha took place in 1927. The All India Kisan Sabha was formed in 1936.  The Rampa Rebellion is incorrectly paired with 1932; its timeframe was 1922-1924.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


These questions demonstrate the required format and difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors to test the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the provided facts.  The explanations provide sufficient detail to justify the correct answers and clarify potential points of confusion.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Organization                  Action Related to FDI
1. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) :  Prohibits FDI in certain sectors
2. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                     :   Regulates FDI in the insurance sector
3. Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CCFI) :  Formulates policy for FDI
4. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)    :  Monitors FDI inflows into the stock market


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The DPIIT plays a significant role in formulating and implementing FDI policy in India, but it doesn't directly prohibit FDI in specific sectors. That function is primarily handled by the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CCFI), which reviews and approves or rejects proposals for FDI based on various factors, including national security and economic interests.  While the RBI does not directly regulate FDI in the insurance sector, it plays a crucial role in monitoring the financial health and stability of the insurance sector, which indirectly affects FDI investment. SEBI's role is to regulate and monitor the securities market; therefore, its actions significantly impact FDI inflows through the stock market.


**2. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                                      FDI Status
1. Power Generation                           :  Fully open to FDI
2. Infrastructure Development                 :  Subject to government approval
3. Textile Manufacturing                        :  Permitted with certain conditions
4. Chit Funds                                   :  Prohibited


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's FDI policy generally encourages foreign investment in most sectors, with varying degrees of openness. Power generation is largely open to FDI, though specific projects may require approvals. Infrastructure development usually involves government approvals and may be subject to specific regulations.  Textile manufacturing attracts FDI, but the government might impose conditions to protect domestic industries. Chit funds are a sector where FDI is generally prohibited due to regulatory and financial risks.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Account/Concept                     Component
1. Capital Account                               :  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
2. Current Account Deficit (CAD)                 :  Trade deficit
3. Balance of Payments                           :  Capital Account
4. India’s Trade Deficit                          :  Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The capital account of the balance of payments records capital flows, including FDI. A current account deficit (CAD) arises when a country's imports exceed its exports, and a major component of this is the trade deficit. The balance of payments comprises both the current account and the capital account. While a trade deficit contributes to the current account and can be influenced by FPI, FPI itself is not a direct component of India's trade deficit; it's a component of the capital account.


**4. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function/Responsibility                     Related Entity/Policy
1. Monetary Policy Implementation              :  Government of India
2. Regulation of Commercial Banks              :  Priority Sector Lending (PSL)
3. Surplus Transfer                             :  Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)
4. Regulation of Credit Information Companies :  All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RBI implements monetary policy, but its actions are guided by, and often in coordination with, the Government of India's overall economic objectives. The RBI directly regulates commercial banks, and a significant aspect of this regulation involves the implementation of Priority Sector Lending (PSL) guidelines.  The RBI transfers its surplus to the Government of India, not to RRBs. While the RBI regulates various entities, Credit Information Companies (CICs) are directly regulated by the RBI; it doesn't directly regulate AIFIs in the same way.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Component                                 Characteristic
1. Cess                                         :  Earmarked for specific purposes
2. Surcharge                                    :  Levied on income tax
3. Goods and Services Tax (GST)                 :  Indirect tax
4. Direct Tax                                   :  Corporate Income Tax


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Cesses are typically levied for specific purposes, such as infrastructure development or education.  A surcharge is an additional levy imposed on top of existing taxes, often income tax. GST is an indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services.  Direct taxes are levied directly on income or profits, and corporate income tax is a prime example.



**6. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following pairs:**

   Condition                                     Classification as NPA
1. Overdue interest and/or principal for >90 days:  Condition for classification as NPA
2. Overdue principal or interest for one crop season for long-duration crops: Condition for classification as NPA
3.  Loan restructuring                           : Leads to classification as NPA
4.  High GNPA ratio                             : Indicates a healthy loan portfolio


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

In India, a loan is classified as an NPA if interest and/or principal repayments remain overdue for more than 90 days, or if the installment of principal or interest remains overdue for one crop season for long-duration crops. Loan restructuring does not automatically lead to NPA classification; it's a measure taken to prevent a loan from becoming an NPA.  A high Gross Non-Performing Asset (GNPA) ratio indicates a less healthy, not healthier, loan portfolio with a higher risk of defaults.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Waterways (NW)                       River
1. NW 1                                         :  Brahmaputra River
2. NW 2                                         :  Ganga River
3. NW 3                                         :  Barak River
4. NW 4                                         :  Godavari River


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

National Waterways (NWs) in India are designated stretches of rivers and canals declared as waterways under the National Waterways Act, 2016.  NW-1 is indeed on the Ganga River,  NW-2 is on the Brahmaputra River, and NW-3 is on the Barak River.  NW-4 is on the Godavari River.


**8. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                           MSP Status
1. Rice                                          :  Mandated crop for MSP
2. Wheat                                         :  Mandated crop for MSP
3. Pulses                                        :  Mandated crop for MSP
4. Cotton                                        :  Not a mandated crop for MSP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India fixes MSP for several agricultural crops.  While the exact number and list of mandated crops can fluctuate, rice, wheat, and pulses are consistently included as mandated crops for MSP. Cotton, while important, is not consistently included in the list of mandated crops for MSP.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) Facility      Location
1. Visakhapatnam                               :  Andhra Pradesh
2. Mangalore                                    :  Karnataka
3. Padur                                        :  Andhra Pradesh
4. Chandikhol                                  :  Odisha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's SPR program aims to ensure energy security by storing crude oil reserves.  Visakhapatnam and Mangalore are existing SPR facilities, located in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka respectively.  Padur and Chandikhol represent new facilities added under Phase II of the SPR program, located in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.


**10. With reference to the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), consider the following pairs:**

    Statement                                      Correct/Incorrect
1.  Higher REER improves export competitiveness : Incorrect
2.  Higher REER makes imports cheaper            : Incorrect
3.  REER is an indicator of international competitiveness: Correct
4.  REER is adjusted for inflation                : Correct


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A higher REER indicates that the domestic currency has appreciated relative to a basket of currencies of its trading partners, making exports less competitive and imports more expensive. A lower REER would improve export competitiveness. The REER is a crucial indicator of a nation's international competitiveness, reflecting its ability to compete in global markets.  The REER is calculated by adjusting the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) for relative price levels (inflation) between the country and its trading partners.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                                      Association/Achievement
    1. Satoshi Nakamoto                          :   Launched the Kalaram Temple Entry Satyagraha
    2. Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar                     :   Author of "Thiruvalluvar"
    3. Sanjay Malhotra                           :   Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
    4. Madan Mohan Malviya                     :   Champion of Dalit rights and author of Arthashastra
    5. Raja Bhalendra Singh                     :   Led the Mahad Satyagraha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Sanjay Malhotra's appointment as the RBI Governor is a recent and well-documented fact.  The other pairs are deliberately mismatched to create challenging distractors.  Satoshi Nakamoto is associated with Bitcoin, not the Kalaram Temple Entry Satyagraha (which was led by Dr. Ambedkar). Dr. Ambedkar is a champion of Dalit rights, but he didn't author "Thiruvalluvar" (that was Thiruvalluvar).  Madan Mohan Malviya played a role in Indian politics and education, but he's not known for championing Dalit rights or writing Arthashastra (that was Kautilya). Finally, Raja Bhalendra Singh is associated with the Asian Games, not the Mahad Satyagraha (led by Dr. Ambedkar).  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of diverse figures and events, requiring precise factual recall to identify the single correct pairing.


**2. With reference to the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Law                                      Provision/Coverage
    1. Collection of Statistics Act, 2008       :   Covers establishments under the Bidi and Cigar Workers Act, 1966
    2. Factories Act, 1948                      :   Regulates electricity undertakings engaged in generation, transmission, and distribution
    3. Electricity Act, 2003                    :   Provides the statutory basis for conducting the ASI since 1959.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The Collection of Statistics Act, 2008, forms the legal framework under which the ASI is currently conducted, and it includes factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948, and establishments under the Bidi and Cigar Workers Act, 1966.  Pair 2 is incorrect because the Factories Act, 1948, doesn't regulate electricity undertakings; that's under the purview of the Electricity Act, 2003. Pair 3 is incorrect as the ASI's initial legal basis was the Collection of Statistics Act, 1953, not the Electricity Act, 2003. The question tests understanding of the legal and regulatory framework surrounding the ASI and requires careful analysis of the provided pairs.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative             Key Feature/Objective
    1. Jalvahak Scheme                         :   35% reimbursement of operating expenses for cargo transported via National Waterways 1, 2, and 16
    2.  Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme :   Covers coconut plantations in the Pacific atolls
    3.  MSP                                    :   Announced by the ONGC at the beginning of the sowing season


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correct. The Jalvahak scheme, indeed, offers a reimbursement of operating expenses for cargo transported via specific national waterways. Pair 2 is incorrect; the PLI scheme is not related to coconut plantations in the Pacific. Pair 3 is incorrect because MSP is announced by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), not ONGC. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various government schemes and their specific features, requiring precise factual knowledge to eliminate the incorrect options.


**4. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Law/Policy                           Implementation/Function
    1. Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934        :   Manages the Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) Programme
    2. Monetary Policy                         :   Implemented by the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL)
    3.  Hilton Young Commission recommendations:   Provided the statutory basis for the RBI's functioning


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Reserve Bank of India was established based on the recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission. The other pairs are incorrect. The RBI does not manage the SPR Programme (that's under the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited).  Monetary policy is implemented by the RBI, not the ISPRL. This question tests the candidate’s awareness of the RBI’s establishment and functions, requiring discrimination between its core roles and those of other entities.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tax Component                           Characteristic/Application
    1. Cess                                   :   Imposed on higher-income individuals to increase government revenue.
    2. Surcharge                             :   Used for designated causes like education or health.
    3. GST                                   :   Levied over and above basic tax liability, along with Cess and Surcharge.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. A surcharge is an additional levy imposed on the base tax amount, generally for a specific purpose.  Pair 1 is incorrect because Cess, not Surcharge, is earmarked for designated causes. Pair 3 is incorrect because GST itself is a base tax on which cess and surcharge can be levied; it isn't levied *on top* of them.  The question demands a thorough understanding of tax components and their applications, requiring the ability to distinguish between closely related concepts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Official        Action/Responsibility
1. Lok Sabha                          :   Impeaches the President
2. President                          :   Dissolves the Lok Sabha
3. Council of Ministers              :   Advises the President on pardons
4. Rajya Sabha                        :   Elects the Vice-President
5.  Prime Minister                    :  Heads the Council of Ministers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The Lok Sabha, along with the Rajya Sabha, has the power to impeach the President. The President holds the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha, a crucial aspect of the parliamentary system.  The Council of Ministers aids and advises the President, including in matters of granting pardons. The Rajya Sabha elects the Vice-President, who is also the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Finally, the Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers, forming the core of the executive branch in India's parliamentary system.  The options that exclude any of these pairs are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the constitutionally defined roles and responsibilities of these key governmental entities and officials.  A thorough understanding of the Indian political system is essential to correctly match these pairs, highlighting the interplay between the legislature and executive.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governmental Entity/Act          Characteristic/Feature
1.  15th Finance Commission            :   Determines allocation of central taxes to states
2.  FRBM Act, 2003                    :   Sets fiscal deficit targets for the government
3.  Article 293 of the Constitution   :   Governs state borrowings
4.  GST Council                       :   Decides GST tax rates and exemptions
5.  NITI Aayog                       :   Publishes the National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The 15th Finance Commission is responsible for recommending the distribution of central taxes amongst the states. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, aims to maintain fiscal discipline by setting targets for fiscal deficits.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution deals with the borrowing powers of states, requiring central government consent under certain circumstances. The GST Council, a joint body of central and state governments, determines GST rates and exemptions.  NITI Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India, plays a significant role in monitoring and analyzing various development indicators, including the National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).  Therefore, any option excluding one or more of these accurately matched pairs would be incorrect, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the institutional framework governing Indian fiscal policy and planning.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator/Concept          Description/Characteristic
1.  Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD)           :   Difference between total revenue and total expenditure
2.  Tax Buoyancy                       :   Responsiveness of tax revenue to changes in national income
3.  Current Account Deficit (CAD)       :   Excess of imports of goods and services over exports
4.  Public Debt                         :   Total liabilities payable by the central government
5.  General Government Debt             :   Indebtedness of the central, state governments, and UTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one mismatched pair.  While the descriptions of CAD, Public Debt, and General Government Debt are correct, the description of Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD) in option (a), (c), and (d) is incomplete and inaccurate. GFD is the difference between total expenditure and total receipts (revenue plus non-debt capital receipts).  Option (b) correctly matches Tax Buoyancy, Current Account Deficit (CAD), Public Debt, and General Government Debt with their respective descriptions. Tax buoyancy accurately reflects the relationship between tax revenue and national income. CAD correctly defines the imbalance between imports and exports of goods and services. Public debt accurately describes the central government's liabilities.  General government debt accurately encompasses the indebtedness of all levels of government. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of key macroeconomic indicators and their definitions.  Understanding these terms is crucial for analyzing India's economic performance and policy choices.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Act/Scheme              Purpose/Function
1.  SARFAESI Act, 2002                 :   Regulates Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)
2.  Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) :   Provides capital expenditure-linked incentives to states
3.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):   Monetizes underutilized public assets
4.  National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL):   An ARC that acquires stressed assets from banks
5.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)         :   Conducts auctions for Government Securities (G-Secs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer because it includes all the correctly matched pairs. The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) provides the legal framework for the regulation of ARCs. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate revenue by monetizing underutilized public assets. NARCL is indeed a prominent ARC involved in acquiring stressed assets from banks.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a key role in managing government borrowing by conducting auctions for G-Secs.  Option (a) is incorrect because the PLI scheme primarily targets specific sectors for incentivizing domestic manufacturing and not solely capital expenditure-linked incentives to states. Options (c) and (d) incorrectly include or exclude pairs, demonstrating an incomplete understanding of the institutions and mechanisms involved in India's financial and infrastructure sectors.  This question tests knowledge of key government initiatives and their roles in managing the economy.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                  Key Feature/Provision
1.  Code on Wages, 2019              :   Proposed a universal minimum wage
2.  Minimum Wages Act, 1948          :   Specifies a fixed minimum wage for all sectors
3.  Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987:   Provides statutory status to Lok Adalats
4.  Competition Act, 2002             :   Established the Competition Commission of India (CCI)
5.  Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993:   Established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Code on Wages, 2019, aimed to establish a more unified minimum wage framework across different sectors.  The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, indeed gave Lok Adalats their statutory status.  The Competition Act, 2002, established the CCI to regulate competition in the market. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, established the NHRC.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, provides a framework for setting minimum wages but doesn't specify a fixed minimum wage for all sectors; it allows for variation across states and occupations.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly include pair 2 or exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs, indicating a less than complete understanding of the key labour laws and regulatory frameworks in India.  This question tests understanding of important legislation and its provisions.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Organization      Overseen Organization
1. Ministry of Home Affairs       :    Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
2. Ministry of Personnel, PG & Pensions :   National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)
3. NITI Aayog                     :    National Investigation Agency (NIA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) oversees the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), a crucial investigative agency dealing with various crimes, including corruption and serious offenses.  The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (DoP&T) oversees the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), responsible for maintaining national crime data. NITI Aayog is not directly involved in overseeing the NIA. The NIA, a specialized counter-terrorism agency, reports directly to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly link organizations with their overseeing ministries or agencies.  The incorrect pairings demonstrate a misunderstanding of the organizational structure and reporting lines within the Indian government.


**2. With reference to committees related to Indian governance, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                     Area of Focus
1. Malimath Committee            :   Police Reforms
2. Verma Committee                :   Centre-State Relations
3. Punchhi Commission             :   Criminal Justice System Reforms
4. Sarkaria Commission             :   Fundamental Duties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Malimath Committee focused on reforms within the criminal justice system, proposing significant changes to police procedures and judicial processes. The Punchhi Commission dealt extensively with Centre-State relations, examining the balance of power and administrative efficiency between the central and state governments. The Sarkaria Commission also focused on Centre-State relations.  The Verma Committee was concerned with the recommendations regarding Fundamental Duties.  Option (a) is incorrect because it incorrectly links the Malimath Committee to police reforms. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs the Verma Committee with Centre-State relations and the Sarkaria Commission with Fundamental Duties. Option (d) is incorrect as it mismatches both pairs.  The correct pairings highlight the expertise and contributions of these specific committees to vital aspects of Indian governance.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Document/Permit               Required by
1. Protected Area Permit (PAP)   :   Only Indian Citizens
2. Protected Area Permit (PAP)   :   Non-Resident Indians (NRIs)
3. Inner Line Permit (ILP)       :    Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A Protected Area Permit (PAP) is required for visiting certain restricted areas in India, and this applies to both Indian citizens and foreign nationals, including NRIs.  The Inner Line Permit (ILP) system is primarily used to regulate entry into certain protected areas in Northeast India and it does not apply to OCI cardholders.  Option (a) is incorrect because PAPs are not restricted to only Indian citizens. Option (b) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it mismatches the ILP with OCI cardholders.  Understanding the distinctions between these permits and their applicability to different categories of individuals is crucial for comprehending India's border and access regulations.



**4. With reference to Himachal Pradesh, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                         Characteristic
1.  Geographical Location         :   Punjab Himalayas
2.  Administrative Status        :   State
3.  Historical Event              :   Integration with India
4.  Art Form                       :   Thangka Painting
5.  Economic Activity             :   Tea Plantations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Himachal Pradesh is geographically located in the Punjab Himalayas. It is currently a state of India, having achieved statehood after its integration with India.  Thangka painting is a significant art form in Himachal Pradesh. However, tea plantations are not a major economic activity in Himachal Pradesh; it's more associated with apple cultivation. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correct matching of the historical event. Option (c) is incorrect as it wrongly includes Thangka painting. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes an incorrect pairing for economic activity.  The correct answer reflects a comprehensive understanding of Himachal Pradesh's geography, political status, cultural heritage, and primary economic activities.


**5. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Provision
1. Article 72                       :   Pardon power of the Governor
2. Article 161                     :   Pardon power of the President
3. Article 105(2)                   :   Freedom of speech in Parliament
4. Article 194(2)                  :   Freedom from arrest for legislators


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Article 105(2) of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants freedom of speech to members of Parliament within the Parliament. This is a fundamental privilege.  Article 72 deals with the pardon power of the President, not the Governor. Article 161 grants pardon power to the Governor.  Article 194(2) is the counterpart of Article 105(2) for State Legislatures, granting similar freedom of speech.  Freedom from arrest for legislators is provided for under the Code of Civil Procedure, not directly within the Constitution. Option (a) is incorrect as it mismatches Article 72. Option (c) is incorrect because while Article 105(2) is correctly matched, Article 194(2) is not directly related to freedom from arrest. Option (d) incorrectly pairs all four articles.  A thorough understanding of the specific provisions within these articles is essential for accurate matching.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                              Key Feature
1.  Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993:   Establishes the Lokpal
2.  Consumer Protection Act, 2019      :   Regulates misleading advertisements
3.  The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) Act :   Establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, establishes the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), which plays a key role in regulating misleading advertisements and protecting consumer rights.  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), not the Lokpal. The Lokpal is established under a separate Act. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) is established under a separate act and is not related to the NHRC's establishment.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the functions and establishing acts of the organizations and laws mentioned. This question tests the knowledge of specific legislation and their roles in Indian governance.


**7. With reference to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), consider the following pairs:**

    Committee                     Recommendation
1.  Tandon Committee              :  Establishment of NCRB
2.  National Police Commission    :  Establishment of NCRB
3.  Malimath Committee            :  Restructuring of Police Force

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The foundation of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) was indeed based on the recommendations of both the Tandon Committee and the National Police Commission. These committees played crucial roles in advocating for a centralized system for collecting and analyzing crime data in India. The Malimath Committee focused on broader criminal justice system reforms, including police modernization, but not specifically on the NCRB's establishment. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (b) is similarly incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because the Malimath Committee's focus was different.  This question tests the knowledge of specific committees and their contributions to the development of the NCRB.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Subject Matter
1. Article 67(b)                  :   Removal of the President
2. Article 72                      :   Pardon powers of the Governor
3. Article 161                    :   Pardon powers of the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 161 of the Indian Constitution deals with the pardon powers vested in the President of India.  Article 67(b) pertains to the removal of the Vice-President, not the President. Article 72 deals with the pardon power of the President, not the Governor. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the subject matter of the constitutional articles listed.  This question tests the understanding of specific constitutional articles and their provisions.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body              Function/Power
1.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):   Appoints the Chairperson of the CBI
2.  Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)     :   Oversees CBI investigations related to anti-corruption
3.  Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)     :   Investigates crimes outside India if they involve Indian citizens

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) oversees CBI investigations related to anti-corruption cases. The CBI can investigate crimes outside India if they involve Indian citizens or affect Indian interests, subject to international laws and treaties. The NHRC does not appoint the CBI Chairperson; that is done through a different process. Option (a) is incorrect as it mismatches the NHRC's function. Option (b) is similarly incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because the NHRC does not have the power to appoint the CBI Chairperson. This question tests the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different government bodies.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Commission       Recommendation/Focus
1.  Padmanabhaiah Committee     :   Criminal Justice System Reforms
2.  Ribeiro Committee             :   Tax Reforms
3.  Mooshahary Committee        :   Police Reforms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Mooshahary Committee focused on police reforms in India, reviewing previous recommendations and suggesting improvements to policing structures and practices. The Padmanabhaiah Committee focused on police reforms, not criminal justice reforms. The Ribeiro Committee also focused on police reforms, not tax reforms. Option (a) is incorrect as it mismatches the Padmanabhaiah Committee. Option (c) is incorrect as it mismatches the Padmanabhaiah Committee. Option (d) is incorrect as it mismatches both the Padmanabhaiah and Ribeiro Committees. This question tests the understanding of various committees related to police and criminal justice reforms in India.


**11. With reference to the Good Governance Index, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                          Attribute
1.  NITI Aayog                      :   Releases the index
2.  Ministry of Home Affairs         :    Develops the index methodology
3.  Ten selected states/UTs         :    Index is released for all states annually


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog is responsible for releasing the Good Governance Index.  The methodology for the index is not solely developed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, but involves multiple stakeholders. The index is not released for all states annually; it's typically released for a selection of states and union territories. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect pairings regarding the Good Governance Index's development and release.  This question tests understanding of the Good Governance Index and its related entities.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment                 Provision
1.  52nd Amendment Act, 1985    :   Establishes the Lokpal
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Includes Anti-Defection Law
3.  Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 : Establishes the NHRC


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in India. The 52nd Amendment Act, 1985, introduced the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution, which deals with the anti-defection law, not the Lokpal. The Lokpal is established under a separate act. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, focuses on disability rights and does not include the anti-defection law.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the key provisions of the acts mentioned.  This question tests the knowledge of specific legislation and their main features.


**13. With reference to the judicial system in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Grounds for Removal                  Applicable to
1.  Proved misbehaviour or incapacity :   Judges of the Supreme Court
2.  Proved misbehaviour or incapacity :   Members of the NHRC
3.  Loss of confidence of the Lok Sabha:   Vice-President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Judges of the Supreme Court and members of the NHRC can be removed from office on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. The Vice-President can be removed by a resolution passed by both houses of Parliament, which essentially signifies a loss of confidence from the Lok Sabha.  All three pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests the knowledge of the removal processes for various constitutional and statutory office holders.


**14.  Consider the following pairs:**

    State                           Distinguishing Feature
1.  Arunachal Pradesh              :   Entirely covered under Protected Area Permit (PAP) regulations
2.  Sikkim                          :   Entirely covered under Inner Line Permit (ILP) regulations
3.  Himachal Pradesh               :   Partially covered under Inner Line Permit (ILP) regulations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Arunachal Pradesh is the only state entirely covered under the Protected Area Permit (PAP) regulations. Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh are not entirely under ILP regulations.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the applicability of PAP and ILP regulations to these states.  This question tests knowledge of specific state regulations related to access and permits.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee        Characteristic
1.  Privileges Committee           :   Exists only in the Lok Sabha
2.  Joint Committee of Parliament :   Is a permanent committee
3.  Ethics Committee              :  Investigates breaches of parliamentary privilege


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The Ethics Committee investigates matters of unethical conduct among parliamentarians.  The Privileges Committee exists in both Houses of Parliament, not just the Lok Sabha.  Joint Committees of Parliament are constituted for specific purposes and are dissolved after completing their tasks; they are not permanent.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the characteristics of the parliamentary committees. This question tests the understanding of different parliamentary committees and their functions.


**16. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Term              Description
1.  Adjournment Sine Die          :   Indefinite suspension of a session
2.  Prorogation                    :   Formal end of a parliamentary session
3.  Dissolution                    :   The House is permanently dissolved


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Adjournment sine die refers to the indefinite suspension of a parliamentary session. Prorogation marks the formal end of a session. Dissolution signifies the permanent end of a legislative body's existence.  This question tests knowledge of parliamentary terminology and procedures.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                    Provision/Feature
1. Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024                :   Merges the Indian Railway Board Act, 1905, into the Railways Act, 1989
2. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987            :   Provides for the establishment of Lok Adalats
3. Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993    :   Establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
4. Judges Inquiry Act, 1968                         :   Details procedure for removing judges, granting Speaker/Chairman discretion to admit/reject removal motions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024, explicitly aims to consolidate the legal framework governing Indian Railways by merging the Indian Railway Board Act, 1905, into the Railways Act, 1989.  The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, provides the statutory backing for the establishment and functioning of Lok Adalats, crucial for alternative dispute resolution. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, is the foundational legislation for the NHRC, a statutory body tasked with protecting and promoting human rights in India. Finally, the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, outlines the process for the removal of judges, granting the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha the authority to determine the admissibility of a removal motion.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  A complete understanding of Indian legal and administrative frameworks is essential to correctly match these acts/amendments with their key features.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                                  Related Entity/Power
1. Article 72                                          :   Power of the Governor to grant pardons
2. Article 44                                          :   Directive Principle of State Policy on Uniform Civil Code
3. Article 239AA                                      :   Special status for Delhi as National Capital Territory
4. Article 123                                          :   Ordinance-making power of the President


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Article 44 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to secure a Uniform Civil Code for citizens. Article 239AA, added by the 69th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1991, grants Delhi special status as the National Capital Territory. Article 123 empowers the President to promulgate ordinances when Parliament is not in session.  However, Article 72 deals with the President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, not the Governor's.  The Governor's pardoning power is under Article 161.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as it includes the three correctly matched pairs, while options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete or include an incorrect pairing.  A comprehensive understanding of the Indian Constitution is necessary to accurately identify the entities and powers associated with each article.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                      Key Feature/Objective
1. Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023  :   Removes all offences and penalties under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898
2. Competition Act, 2002                             :   Established the Competition Commission of India (CCI)
3. BIS Act, 2016                                     :   Replaced the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
4. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987                :   Established the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Jan Vishwas Act, 2023, significantly decriminalized various provisions across multiple laws, including the complete removal of offenses and penalties under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898. The Competition Act, 2002, established the CCI to regulate competition in the Indian market. The BIS Act, 2016, restructured the Bureau of Indian Standards, replacing the ISI.  Finally, the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, established NALSA to provide legal aid and promote ADR mechanisms, including Lok Adalats.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests the knowledge of important Indian legislation and their key characteristics, highlighting the importance of understanding the evolution and functions of various regulatory bodies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statutory Body                                   Parent Ministry/Department
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)          :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
2. Competition Commission of India (CCI)              :   Ministry of Corporate Affairs
3. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)                   :   Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution
4. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)              :   Ministry of Home Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The CCI functions under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The BIS operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. The NCRB falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  However, the NHRC is incorrectly paired with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment; it actually falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Therefore, option (c) is correct, while options (a), (b), and (d) either include the incorrectly matched pair or omit correctly matched pairs. This question tests the knowledge of the organizational structure of key Indian government bodies and their administrative affiliations.  It highlights the need for precise knowledge of the ministries responsible for overseeing different regulatory bodies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Court/Tribunal                                   Jurisdiction/Specialization
1. Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT)              :   Appeals under the Direct Taxes Acts
2. Supreme Court of India                           :   Advisory Jurisdiction on matters referred by the President
3. Delhi High Court                                  :   Personality rights protection
4. Karnataka High Court                              :   Transfer pricing disputes (initially held final authority on ALP determination)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The ITAT specializes in appeals related to direct taxes. The Supreme Court of India possesses advisory jurisdiction, including the power to advise the President on legal matters.  The Delhi High Court has ruled on cases involving the protection of personality rights. The Karnataka High Court's initial ruling on transfer pricing disputes, specifically regarding the finality of the ITAT's arm's length price (ALP) determination, was later overturned by the Supreme Court.  While the Karnataka High Court did initially have jurisdiction over transfer pricing disputes, its role in determining the finality of ALP was superseded by the Supreme Court's decision.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, accurately reflecting the jurisdictions and specializations of the listed entities.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete or include an inaccurate pairing. This question assesses the understanding of the Indian judicial system, its hierarchical structure, and the specific jurisdictions of different courts and tribunals.  It also tests the knowledge of recent Supreme Court judgements impacting specific legal areas.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Act                                     Specific Provision/Impact
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992         :   Constitutionalized Urban Local Governments
2. 69th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1991         :   Conferred special status on Delhi as NCTD
3. 36th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1975         :   Granted statehood to Sikkim
4. Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019      :   Bifurcated Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The 69th Amendment Act granted Delhi its special status as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD). The 36th Amendment Act formally granted Sikkim statehood within the Indian Union. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, resulted in the bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories.  However, the 73rd Amendment Act constitutionalized Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), not Urban Local Governments; that was the 74th Amendment. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are either incomplete or include an incorrect pairing. This question tests the knowledge of significant constitutional amendments and their impact on India's federal structure and administrative divisions.  It also highlights the importance of understanding the specific changes brought about by each amendment.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Concept/Doctrine                            Source/Basis
1.  Promissory Estoppel                               :   Contractual Law
2.  Henderson Doctrine                               :   Explanation IV of Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)
3.  Doctrine of Res Judicata                         :   Article 142 of the Constitution
4.  Preventive Detention                              :   Articles 22(1) and 22(2) of the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Promissory estoppel is a principle stemming from contractual law, preventing a promisor from going back on a promise even without formal consideration. The Henderson Doctrine, related to the principle of res judicata, finds its basis in Explanation IV of Section 11 of the CPC, preventing relitigation of already decided matters.  However, the doctrine of res judicata itself isn't directly sourced from Article 142; while Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to do complete justice, it doesn't define res judicata.  Further, preventive detention, while mentioned in Article 22, isn't solely based on those clauses; it's governed by various other laws and Articles.  Therefore, option (b) is correct, accurately reflecting the sources of the legal concepts. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings.  This question tests the understanding of fundamental legal principles and their sources within the Indian legal system, requiring a nuanced grasp of legal concepts and their origins.


**8.  Consider the following pairs:**

    International Convention/Treaty                     Related Legal Right/Area
1.  Rome Convention (1961)                           :   Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
2.  TRIPS Agreement (1994)                           :   Secures certain publicity rights related to performers and phonograms
3.  WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) :   Protects performers’ rights, phonogram producers’ rights and broadcasting rights
4.  Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1998):   Protects performers' rights in a digital environment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The TRIPS Agreement, while broad, does encompass certain aspects of publicity rights for performers and phonogram producers.  The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) directly protects the rights of performers and phonogram producers, particularly in the digital environment, including broadcasting rights. However, the Rome Convention primarily focuses on performers' rights, phonogram producers' rights and broadcasting rights, not specifically IPR protection; IPR is covered more extensively under TRIPS. The Paris Convention is also primarily concerned with industrial property rights, not performers' rights in the digital environment. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of international legal instruments and their specific areas of coverage.  This question assesses understanding of international conventions related to intellectual property and personality rights, requiring a detailed knowledge of their specific provisions.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Supreme Court Judgement/Ruling                     Legal Principle/Concept Affected
1. Selvi & Ors vs State of Karnataka & Anr (2010)     :   Admissibility of Narco analysis reports as primary evidence
2.  Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) Case (2018)      :   Right to Privacy
3.  Maru Ram v. Union of India (1980)                 :   President's power to grant pardons independently
4.  SR Bommai’s case                                  :   Judicial review of President's actions during a State emergency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The *Selvi* case significantly impacted the admissibility of narco-analysis, brain mapping, and polygraph test results as primary evidence in court, emphasizing the right against self-incrimination. The *Puttaswamy* judgment established the right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21.  The *Maru Ram* case clarified the President's pardoning power, establishing that the President doesn't act independently but on the advice of the central government.  Finally, the *SR Bommai* case affirmed the Supreme Court's power to judicially review the President's actions during a state emergency.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they fail to include all the correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the recall of important Supreme Court judgments and their impact on various legal principles, demanding precise knowledge of landmark cases and their implications.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Organization/Body                    Associated Scheme/Initiative

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The Department of Justice is responsible for implementing the FTSCs scheme, aimed at fast-tracking rape and POCSO Act cases. The Ministry of Rural Development oversees the RGSA, focused on strengthening PRIs. However, Mission Shakti, aimed at women's safety and empowerment, falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the MHA.  The Model Prisons Act, 2023, is under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.   Therefore, option (b) is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, showcasing the importance of accurate association of government ministries with their respective schemes and initiatives. This question tests the knowledge of various government schemes and their implementing ministries, highlighting the need for precise awareness of administrative responsibilities.

4.  Cinematograph Act, 1952                           :   Transfer Pricing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Emblems and Names Act protects the unauthorized use of certain names and symbols, relevant to posthumous personality rights. The Trade Marks Act is related to the right to publicity, safeguarding commercial exploitation of a person's image or likeness.  However, hate speech is not primarily regulated by the IPC, though certain provisions might be applicable, and transfer pricing falls under the Income Tax Act, not the Cinematograph Act.  Therefore, option (a) is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one wrongly matched pair.  This question assesses the knowledge of various legal instruments and their specific applications in protecting personality rights and addressing issues of hate speech, requiring a detailed understanding of the Indian legal framework.

**Explanation:**

The committee responsible for appointing the NHRC Chairperson includes the Prime Minister as its head, as specified by law. The Supreme Court Collegium's composition is well-established as the Chief Justice of India and four seniormost judges. The Mediation Council of India's structure, as defined by legislation, includes a Chairperson along with full-time and part-time members.  Lastly, the committee formed under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, consists of a Supreme Court judge, a High Court Chief Justice, and an eminent jurist to investigate judicial misconduct.

(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Baltic Sea is known for its brackish water. The Red Sea is part of the Great Rift Valley. The Mediterranean Sea connects to the Atlantic Ocean via the Strait of Gibraltar. Pangong Tso is a high-altitude saltwater lake.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Black Sea is not a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean; it's a marginal sea of the Black Sea. Option (b) omits the correct pairing of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. Option (c) incorrectly includes the Black Sea pairing.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Mount Everest is the highest point on Earth and is located in both China and Nepal, Mount Blanc is not the highest point in Switzerland.  The highest point in Switzerland is Dufourspitze.  However, Aconcagua is correctly identified as the highest point in Argentina. Therefore, only options 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it misidentifies the highest point of Switzerland. Option (c) is incorrect as it misidentifies Mount Blanc as the highest point in Switzerland. Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of Aconcagua with Argentina.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Program/Initiative                    Key Feature/Aspect
1. Mission Karmayogi                             :  Employs a competency-driven approach
2. Amrit Gyaan Kosh Portal                        :  Curates best practices aligning with SDGs
3. National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) : Implemented by Karmyogi Bharat SPV
4.  PMHR Council                                  : Oversees Mission Karmayogi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi indeed employs a competency-driven approach to align civil servants' skills with job requirements.  This is a core tenet of its design, focusing on skill-based rather than rule-based training and deployment. The Amrit Gyaan Kosh Portal, a key component of Mission Karmayogi,  explicitly aims to curate best practices across India and aligns its training initiatives with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to ensure global standards are met while addressing India's unique administrative challenges.  The PMHR Council (Prime Minister's Human Resource Council) plays a crucial oversight role in guiding and monitoring the progress of Mission Karmayogi.  However,  the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) is essentially the same as Mission Karmayogi; they are not separate entities with different implementing agencies.  The Karmyogi Bharat SPV is responsible for the implementation of Mission Karmayogi, not NPCSCB as a separate entity. Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Program                       Implementing Ministry/Agency
1. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) : Ministry of Rural Development
2. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)      : Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
3. SVAMITVA Scheme                               : Ministry of Panchayati Raj
4.  Mission Karmayogi                             : Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, providing income support to farmers, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.  The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), a crucial crop insurance scheme, is also managed by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. The SVAMITVA scheme, focused on property mapping in rural areas, is implemented by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  Mission Karmayogi, the civil services capacity building initiative, is under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.  Therefore all the given pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Central Sector Scheme                           Primary Objective
1. PMUY 2.0                                      :  Provide deposit-free LPG connections to low-income families
2.  Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS)    :  Impart quality education to ST children in remote areas
3.  MAHIR (Mission on Advanced and High-Impact Research) : Facilitate indigenous R&D in the power sector
4.  AMD-CF (Assistance to Medical Device Clusters for Common Facilities) : Promote self-reliance in medical device manufacturing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PMUY 2.0 explicitly aims to expand access to LPG connections for low-income households, providing a clean cooking fuel source.  Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) are designed to deliver quality education to Scheduled Tribe children in remote areas, bridging educational gaps.  MAHIR focuses on promoting indigenous research, development, and demonstration of advanced technologies in the power sector. The AMD-CF scheme directly supports the growth of medical device clusters, fostering self-reliance in medical device manufacturing within the country.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Program                       Key Technology/Platform Used
1. PMFBY                                         :  DigiClaim for claim settlement
2. SVAMITVA Scheme                               :  Drone survey for mapping
3. Mission Karmayogi                             :  iGOT Karmayogi platform for training
4.  MGNREGA                                      :  Online Management Information System (MIS)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PMFBY utilizes DigiClaim, a digital platform for streamlining claim settlements and ensuring faster payments to farmers. SVAMITVA extensively employs drone technology for efficient and accurate land mapping in rural areas. Mission Karmayogi leverages the iGOT Karmayogi platform for delivering online training to civil servants. While MGNREGA does use an online MIS for monitoring, it's not the scheme's defining technological feature in the same way the others are.  The  core of MGNREGA is the provision of guaranteed wage employment, with the MIS being a supplementary tool for monitoring and management. Therefore, option (b) is the most appropriate.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Program                       Funding Mechanism/Source
1. PM-KISAN                                      : Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)
2.  PMFBY                                         :  Premium shared between Centre and States
3.  Mission Karmayogi                             :  Central budgetary resources
4.  SVAMITVA Scheme                               :  Central Sector Scheme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-KISAN uses DBT for direct transfer of funds to farmers' accounts. PMFBY's funding involves a crucial cost-sharing model between the central and state governments. Mission Karmayogi's funding comes primarily from the central budget. SVAMITVA is categorized as a Central Sector Scheme, indicating that the central government bears the entire financial burden. Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization              Head of Organization (Historically)
1. Border Security Force (BSF) :  Director-General from the Indian Police Service (IPS)
2. Assam Rifles (AR)           :  Director-General from the Indian Army
3. Indian Army                :  Chief of Army Staff from the Indian Military Academy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Border Security Force (BSF) has always had its Director-General appointed from the Indian Police Service (IPS) cadre. This is a long-standing practice reflecting the force's internal security and border management mandate.  Option 1 is thus correctly matched.  Option 2 is incorrect; while the Assam Rifles operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs administratively, its operational command lies with the Ministry of Defence, and the head is not necessarily from the Indian Army.  The appointment to the top position can vary. Option 3 is also incorrect; while the Chief of Army Staff is usually from the Indian Military Academy, it is not a strict requirement, and other military academies also contribute officers to the senior ranks. The selection process for the Chief of Army Staff is merit-based and considers experience across different branches of the army.  Therefore, only pair 1 is accurately matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise              Participating Country
1. Exercise Surya Kiran           :   Sri Lanka
2. Exercise Milan                :   Australia
3. Exercise Harimau Shakti      :   Malaysia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Surya Kiran is a bilateral military exercise between India and Nepal, not Sri Lanka. Exercise Milan is a multinational naval exercise initiated by the Indian Navy, and Australia is one of the many participating countries, but it's not a consistent participant every year.  Exercise Harimau Shakti is an annual joint military exercise conducted alternately in India and Malaysia. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                 Operational Area

2. Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP):   Anti-Naxal Operations
3. Border Security Force (BSF)     :   Indo-Bangladesh Border

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CRPF's primary mandate is internal security, maintaining law and order, not guarding the Indo-Pakistan border. That responsibility primarily rests with the BSF. The ITBP's main operational area is along the India-China border, not in anti-Naxal operations, though they may participate in such operations as needed. The BSF is indeed deployed along the Indo-Bangladesh border. Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Operation           Conducting Force
1. Operation Meghdoot           :    Indian Navy
2. Operation Vijay              :    Indian Army
3. Operation Sankalp           :    Indian Air Force


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Operation Meghdoot was a military operation launched by the Indian Army to occupy the Siachen Glacier. Operation Vijay was a military operation launched by the Indian Army to liberate Goa from Portuguese rule. Operation Sankalp was not a specific operation by the Indian Air Force.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise           Location
1. Exercise CINBAX             :   Pune, India

3. Exercise SLINEX 2024       :   Colombo, Sri Lanka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Exercise CINBAX, a joint counter-terrorism exercise between the Indian and Cambodian armies, was indeed initiated in Pune, India. Exercise Harimau Shakti's 2024 edition was held in Bentong camp, Malaysia, as stated in the provided context. However, Exercise SLINEX 2024 commenced in Visakhapatnam, India, not Colombo, Sri Lanka. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

   Country                 Type of Defence Collaboration
1. Saudi Arabia             :   Joint military exercises only
2. France                   :   Trilateral naval exercises in the Arabian Sea
3. Malaysia                :   Annual joint military exercises in jungle terrain


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India and Saudi Arabia engage in joint ventures, industrial collaboration, and joint military exercises.  The collaboration is not limited to joint military exercises alone. India, France, and the UAE conducted a trilateral *air* exercise, "Desert Knight," in the Arabian Sea, not a naval exercise. India and Malaysia conduct annual joint military exercises focusing on counter-insurgency operations in jungle terrain. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to India's military exercises, consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise             Nature of Exercise
1. Exercise Sea Dragon          :   Bilateral Exercise
2. Exercise Cutlass Express     :   Multinational Exercise
3. Exercise Malabar            :   Trilateral Exercise

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Sea Dragon is a multinational maritime exercise involving multiple navies, not a bilateral one.  Exercise Cutlass Express is indeed a multinational maritime exercise involving multiple countries, primarily focused on maritime security cooperation. Exercise Malabar is a multinational naval exercise, involving four Indo-Pacific partner nations (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States), thus not a trilateral exercise.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Navy is indeed responsible for conducting hydrographic surveys, which are essential for navigation and maritime operations. The Indian Army was responsible for the military operation, Operation Vijay, which led to the liberation of Goa. However, the BSF's primary role is border guarding and internal security; counter-terrorism operations in jungle terrain are primarily conducted by the army.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

**Explanation:**

The IFC-IOR serves as a maritime security information sharing hub, enhancing regional cooperation. The Colombo Security Conclave focuses on maritime security, counter-terrorism, and cybersecurity cooperation.  CTF 153 is focused on maritime security, not hydrographic surveys, which are a naval responsibility. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Military Exercise         Main Focus/Objective
1. Exercise Desert Knight    :   Enhancing combat skills and interoperability among participating air forces
2. Exercise SLINEX             :   Joint counter-terrorism operations
3. Exercise Surya Kiran        :   Jungle warfare and humanitarian assistance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Desert Knight, a trilateral exercise between India, France, and the UAE, primarily aimed at enhancing combat skills and interoperability among the participating air forces. Exercise SLINEX focuses on enhancing interoperability and exchanging best practices in multi-faceted maritime operations, not counter-terrorism. Exercise Surya Kiran, between India and Nepal, focuses on enhancing interoperability in jungle warfare, counter-terrorism operations, and humanitarian assistance. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization             Headquarters Location
    1. OPEC                               :   Vienna, Austria

(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Paris Agreement is a landmark international accord aimed at limiting global warming and mitigating climate change. The Montreal Protocol focuses on phasing out ozone-depleting substances to protect the ozone layer. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) addresses the conservation of biodiversity at the global level. The Kyoto Protocol, while superseded by the Paris Agreement, historically focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries. The Ramsar Convention specifically deals with the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands.  Therefore, option (c) which encompasses all five correctly matched pairs is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete factual recall about these critical international environmental agreements.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA is the primary international organization focused on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including safety and security. IRENA is the leading intergovernmental agency for renewable energy. OPEC, while also involved in some aspects of energy markets, primarily focuses on the production and pricing of oil, a fossil fuel. The IEA's work on biofuels is a significant part of its broader focus on energy security and efficiency.  The ISA is specifically dedicated to promoting solar energy globally.   Therefore, options 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the IAEA. Options (b) and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly include OPEC or exclude the ISA.  A comprehensive understanding of the mandates of these organizations is essential for accurate matching in UPSC-style questions.

(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Non-alignment, a cornerstone of India's post-independence foreign policy, involved maintaining neutrality between the Cold War blocs.  Panchsheel, the five principles of peaceful coexistence, guided India's relations with its neighbours. The Neighbourhood First Policy prioritizes building strong and cooperative relations with India's immediate neighbours. The Act East Policy focuses on strengthening engagement and cooperation with Southeast Asian countries. The Gujral Doctrine emphasized a non-reciprocal approach to relations with smaller neighbours, prioritizing their interests. Therefore, option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuances of India's foreign policy doctrines for UPSC preparation.

4.  Leprosy                                     :   Multidrug therapy (MDT)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Malaria is treated with antimalarial drugs, not gene therapy.  Gene therapy is a potential treatment for haemophilia, aiming to correct the genetic defect responsible for the disease. Multidrug therapy (MDT) is a common treatment for both tuberculosis and leprosy. BCG vaccine is used for preventing tuberculosis. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect due to the mismatched treatment/prevention methods. Option (c) correctly identifies the preventive measure for TB and the treatment for Leprosy.

2.  Cervavac                                   :   Malaria
3.  BCG Vaccine                               :   Tuberculosis


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) is a malaria vaccine, not a cervical cancer vaccine. Cervavac is an HPV vaccine used for preventing cervical cancer, not a malaria vaccine. BCG vaccine is used for preventing tuberculosis. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect due to the mismatched diseases. Option (c) correctly identifies the disease prevented by the BCG vaccine.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                           Initiative/Program
1.  WHO                                   :   National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission

3.  ISRO                                   :   PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission is an Indian government initiative, not a WHO program. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India launched the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) initiative to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.  PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana (a solar rooftop program) is an initiative of the Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not ISRO. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect due to the mismatched initiatives/programs. Option (b) correctly identifies the implementing ministry for the MDA program.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the national standards body of India and performs various functions including standards formulation, product certification schemes, and eco-labelling.  The BIS sets standards for various substances, including permissible limits for elements like mercury in various contexts (though the specific limit for mercury in drinking water might not be explicitly mentioned in the source).  The Department of Science & Technology (DST) is not directly involved in the administration of the ISI Mark Scheme; the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for this. The Department of Biotechnology (DBT), in collaboration with BRIC-inStem, Bangalore, and Sepio Health Pvt. Ltd., developed Kisan Kavach, an anti-pesticide bodysuit. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option 3 is incorrect because the ISI Mark Scheme is administered by the BIS, not the DST.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                  Standard/Scheme
1. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) : IS/ISO 14024:1999
2. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) : Product Certification Scheme related to houses
3.  NASA's Living With a Star program :  Parker Solar Probe

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for developing and implementing various standards and schemes.  The IS/ISO 14024:1999 standard is related to environmental labelling, a function performed by the BIS. The BIS also develops and administers product certification schemes, including those related to houses and infrastructure. NASA's Living With a Star program is indeed responsible for the Parker Solar Probe mission.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                        Organization

2. Germany                          :  European Space Agency (ESA)
3. Uganda                           :  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India collaborates extensively with the World Health Organization (WHO) on various public health initiatives and is a member state.  The European Space Agency (ESA) is a European intergovernmental organization, and Germany is a member state, hence the involvement in the JUICE mission. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is India's national standards body; it does not have any direct connection to Uganda. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  Pairs 2 and 3 are incorrect due to the inaccurate association of organizations with countries.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Satellite/Mission             Agency/Program
1. Chandrayaan-3                :  NASA's Living With a Star program

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Chandrayaan-3 mission was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The JUICE mission is a project of the European Space Agency (ESA). The Parker Solar Probe mission was developed by NASA.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 3 incorrectly link missions with the wrong agencies/programs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease/Virus                   Characteristic/Vector
1. Marburg Virus                   : Fruit bat as natural host
2. Poliovirus                      : Endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan
3.  Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)     :  Transmission primarily through fecal-oral route


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Marburg virus does indeed have fruit bats as a natural host, and this is a well-established fact. Poliovirus, while largely eradicated, remains endemic in only Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Avian Influenza, or Bird Flu, while it *can* be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is primarily spread through contact with infected birds and their droppings.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Pair 3 is incorrect because of the inaccurate description of the primary transmission route of avian influenza.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Bacterium/Disease              Characteristic
1. *H. pylori*                     : Gram-positive bacterium
2. *H. pylori*                     : Causes peptic ulcers
3.  Marburg Virus                  :  High Contagious Virulent Disease


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

*H. pylori* is a gram-negative, not gram-positive, bacterium.  However, it is correctly paired with causing peptic ulcers as a significant health consequence.  The Marburg virus is indeed a highly contagious and virulent disease, causing hemorrhagic fever. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect due to the mischaracterization of *H. pylori*'s Gram staining properties.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Molecule                         Property/Component
1. DNA                               : Composed of left-handed amino acids
2. RNA                               : "Right-handed" nucleotides
3. Proteins                          : Composed of "left-handed" amino acids


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

DNA is composed of nucleotides, not amino acids, and these nucleotides are indeed right-handed in known life forms. RNA also consists of right-handed nucleotides. Proteins are composed of amino acids, and these amino acids are left-handed. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect because they incorrectly assign components or handedness to the molecules.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Medicine Type                     Mechanism/Example
1. GLP-1 Receptor Agonists           : Mimics Glucagon hormone
2. Semaglutide                       : Sold under the brand name Ozempic
3. Hydroxymethanesulphonate (HMS) : Beneficial component of PM2.5


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GLP-1 Receptor Agonists mimic the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone, not the glucagon hormone itself.  Semaglutide is indeed sold under the brand name Ozempic, and it is a GLP-1 Receptor Agonist.  Hydroxymethanesulphonate (HMS) is a harmful, not beneficial, component found in PM2.5. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Pair 3 is incorrect as HMS is a harmful component.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Celestial Body/Phenomenon       Characteristic
1. Black hole                       : Has a surface like a planet

3. Moon                             : Very thin atmosphere called exosphere


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Black holes do not have a surface; their immense gravity prevents even light from escaping.  Sagittarius A* is indeed the nearest supermassive black hole to Earth. The Moon does have a very thin atmosphere, which is correctly identified as an exosphere. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect because black holes lack a surface.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Element                             Source/Location
1. Manganese                         : Chotanagpur plateau
2. Uranium                           : Polymetallic nodules
3. Manganese                         : Western Ghats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Manganese is found in significant deposits in the Chotanagpur plateau.  Uranium is found in polymetallic nodules,  Manganese is also found in the Western Ghats. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is a distractor, playing on the fact that both are minerals, but  the given source does not support a direct link between uranium and polymetallic nodules.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the facts and entities mentioned.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission                 Launch Vehicle/Agency
1.  Chandrayaan-3              :   PSLV-C57
2.  Aditya-L1                   :   Kosmos-3M
3.  Aryabhata                  :   Vikram-1
4.  Dragonfly Mission          :   New Horizons
5.  Juno Mission                 :   Soviet rocket

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 was indeed launched using a GSLV Mk III, while Aditya-L1 utilized PSLV C57.  Aryabhata, India's first satellite, was launched by a Soviet Kosmos-3M rocket, not Vikram-1 which is a Skyroot Aerospace launch vehicle. The Dragonfly mission to Titan is a part of NASA’s New Frontiers Program, but it will not be launched by the New Horizons probe. Juno, NASA's Jupiter mission, was launched in 2011 by a different vehicle than a Soviet rocket. Option (b) correctly identifies only the launch agency of Juno and the launch vehicle of Chandrayaan-3.  The other options incorrectly pair missions with their launch vehicles or agencies, highlighting the need for precise factual recall.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern correct pairings from a list of plausible but incorrect options.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Observatory/Project         Location
1.  IceCube Neutrino Observatory :   Kodaikanal
2.  Kodaikanal Solar Observatory :   Antarctica
3.  Indian Neutrino Observatory  :   Palani Range
4.  China’s TRIDENT             :   South China Sea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is located in Antarctica, not Kodaikanal. The Kodaikanal Solar Observatory is situated in the Palani Range of Tamil Nadu, not Antarctica. The Indian Neutrino Observatory (INO) is planned for construction in Tamil Nadu, and not the Palani Range, specifically.  Only China’s TRIDENT neutrino telescope is correctly matched to its location in the South China Sea.  This question assesses factual recall and requires careful attention to detail to identify the single correct pair among several plausible distractors.  The incorrect options deliberately confuse the locations of different observatories, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar geographical entities.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Engine           Developing Agency
1.  Semi-Cryogenic Engine (SCE) :   Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC)
2.  Kalam-250                   :   Solar Industries
3.  DAT-SG                      :   Indian Mission Control Centre (INMCC)
4.  Liquid Nitrogen              :   National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Semi-Cryogenic Engine (SCE) development is primarily led by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Bengaluru, a part of ISRO, not the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC). While VSSC contributes to SCE development, it is not the primary lead agency. Kalam-250's solid propellant was indeed processed by Solar Industries, making this pair correct.  The DAT-SG (Distress Alert Transmitter) was developed by ISRO, not the INMCC which is responsible for receiving the messages.  Liquid Nitrogen is used in various applications, but its development isn't attributed to the NDDB; the NDDB is involved with Havisure vaccine development. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different organizations in technological developments and requires a nuanced understanding of the relationships between organizations.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the depth of the candidate's knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vaccine                       Developing Agency
1.  Cervavac                     :   Indian Immunologicals Ltd (IIL)
2.  Havisure                     :   Serum Institute
3.  Hepatitis A vaccine           :   National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Cervavac, the indigenous cervical cancer vaccine, was developed by the Serum Institute of India, not Indian Immunologicals Ltd (IIL). Havisure, India's first Hepatitis A vaccine, was correctly developed by Indian Immunologicals Ltd (IIL), a subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).  While the NDDB is the parent company of IIL, the vaccine itself is not directly developed by the NDDB. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific vaccine developments and the organizational structure involved in their creation.  The incorrect options intentionally misattribute vaccines to the wrong developing agencies, requiring the candidate to possess precise factual knowledge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Virus                           Transmission Method
1.  Hepatitis A                  :   Unsafe injections
2.  Hepatitis B                  :   Contaminated food/water
3.  Hepatitis C                  :   Infected blood
4.  Hepatitis E                  :   Mother to child transmission
5.  Nipah Virus                  :   Fecal-oral route


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Hepatitis A is primarily transmitted through contaminated food or water, not unsafe injections. Hepatitis B can be transmitted through various routes including unsafe injections, but contaminated food and water are the main routes for Hepatitis A. Hepatitis C is correctly transmitted through contact with infected blood. Hepatitis E is spread via the fecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated water, not mother-to-child transmission which is more common with Hepatitis B. Nipah virus can be transmitted through various routes including contaminated food, but the fecal-oral route is the primary mode for Hepatitis E. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific disease transmission methods, requiring precise recall and the ability to differentiate between similar modes of transmission. The distractors are designed to test for a thorough understanding of the subject matter.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                    Activity/Project
1.  FSSAI                          :   AGMARK certification
2.  DMI                            :   State Food Safety Index
3.  ISRO                           :   Havisure vaccine
4.  NDDB                           :   Kalam-250 rocket motor
5.  Skyroot Aerospace            :   Development of DAT-SG


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) does not directly handle AGMARK certification; that falls under the Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI). The DMI is responsible for AGMARK, not the State Food Safety Index, which is a FSSAI initiative. ISRO is a space agency, not involved in the development of Havisure; that was done by Indian Immunologicals Ltd, a subsidiary of NDDB. The Kalam-250 rocket motor was developed by Skyroot Aerospace, not the NDDB. Skyroot Aerospace is responsible for Kalam-250, not the development of DAT-SG which was undertaken by ISRO.  Only Skyroot Aerospace's involvement with Kalam-250 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various Indian organizations and requires a deep understanding of their respective functions.  The distractors are chosen to effectively differentiate between related but distinct agencies.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Summit                   Outcome/Declaration
1.  Global Cervical Cancer Elimination Forum :   Bletchley Declaration
2.  World’s first-ever AI Safety Summit    :    New Delhi Declaration
3.  Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) summit :  Hiroshima AI Process


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Cervical Cancer Elimination Forum did not produce the Bletchley Declaration; that was a result of the World’s first-ever AI Safety Summit. The World’s first-ever AI Safety Summit in the UK resulted in the Bletchley Declaration, not the New Delhi Declaration.  The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) summit in New Delhi produced the New Delhi Declaration, not the Hiroshima AI Process. The Hiroshima AI Process was initiated at the G7 summit hosted by Japan.  Only the pairing of the GPAI summit with the New Delhi Declaration is accurate.  This question assesses the candidate's ability to link specific events with their respective outcomes, requiring precise factual knowledge. The distractors blend related events and declarations to test the candidate’s ability to distinguish between them.

3.  Chandrayaan-3                   :   Soft landing near lunar South Pole


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

UN COVER is a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project aiming to identify first-light galaxies, not to study the Sun. Aditya-L1's primary objective is to study the Sun, not to identify first-light galaxies; that's the purview of UN COVER.  Chandrayaan-3's successful soft landing near the lunar South Pole is a correctly matched fact. This question tests the candidate's ability to connect space missions with their scientific objectives and accomplishments, requiring precise recall and understanding of the nuances of each mission. The distractors are carefully selected to test for accurate knowledge and understanding.

4.  Madhya Pradesh               :   Location of Ratapani Tiger Reserve


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Atacama Trench is significant for its recently discovered deep-sea species, including *Dulcibella camanchaca*, but not for the deepest-living marine mammal. The Western Ghats are not known for the highest Shiva temple; that is Tungnath. Odisha is correctly identified as the largest mass nesting site for Olive Ridley sea turtles. Madhya Pradesh is the correct location for the Ratapani Tiger Reserve. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of geographical features and their associated characteristics, requiring accurate geographical knowledge and the ability to eliminate incorrect pairs based on specific details. The distractors deliberately include plausible but incorrect connections to increase the difficulty level.

2.  Shortfin Mako Shark            :   Slowest shark
3.  Ganges River Dolphin           :   Inhabits Godavari and Krishna rivers
4.  Indian Star Tortoise            :   Found only in India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Milkweed is indeed the primary food source for the monarch butterfly caterpillar. The Shortfin Mako Shark is known as one of the fastest sharks, not the slowest. The Ganges River Dolphin inhabits the Ganga and Brahmaputra river systems, not the Godavari and Krishna rivers. The Indian Star Tortoise is found in several countries, including India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, not solely in India.  Only the statement regarding Milkweed and the monarch butterfly caterpillar is entirely correct.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of specific biological characteristics of plants and animals and requires accurate knowledge to eliminate incorrect pairs. The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate’s knowledge of specific details.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   Plant/Animal                    IUCN Red List Status
1.  Wroughton’s Free-Tailed Bat  :   Critically Endangered
2.  Olive ridley turtle            :   Vulnerable
3.  Indian Star Tortoise           :   Vulnerable
4.  Lion-tailed macaque           :   Endangered


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Wroughton’s Free-Tailed Bat is listed as Least Concern, not Critically Endangered.  The Olive ridley turtle is listed as Vulnerable, not Critically Endangered; it is listed as Endangered. The Indian Star Tortoise is correctly listed as Vulnerable. The Lion-tailed macaque is classified as Endangered, not Critically Endangered. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of conservation status of different species as per the IUCN Red List, requiring accurate recall of the conservation status of each species.  The distractors are strategically placed to test for accurate recall of the  IUCN Red List categorizations.


**16. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Concept/Method    Description/Characteristic
1.  Miyaki Plantation method       :   Unsuitable for urban areas
2.  Champions of the Earth award   :   Launched in 2005
3.  UNCCD                           :   Established at the 1992 Earth Summit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Miyawaki method is sometimes considered unsuitable for urban areas due to high initial maintenance, it is not inherently unsuitable; with proper planning and management, it can be successful. The Champions of the Earth award was launched in 2005, but the statement is incorrect because it is the United Nations highest environmental honor.  The UNCCD (UN Convention to Combat Desertification) was established at the 1992 Earth Summit, making this pair correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of environmental concepts and their characteristics, demanding a nuanced understanding of the concepts. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's deeper understanding of the methods and awards.

3.  Dulcibella camanchaca         :   Deepest-living marine mammal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Western Ghats were declared a World Heritage Site in 2012, but the statement is incorrect because it extends across six Indian states. Ratapani Tiger Reserve is located in Madhya Pradesh, not Rajasthan.  *Dulcibella camanchaca* is significant for representing a new genus and highlighting the Atacama Trench's biodiversity, not for being the deepest-living marine mammal.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific geographical locations and their associated features, requiring detailed and accurate recall of geographical information.  All the pairs are deliberately incorrect to test the candidate's knowledge.


**18. Consider the following pairs:**

2.  Sea Otter                     :   Smallest marine mammal
3.  Shortfin Mako Shark            :   Fastest shark


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bald Eagles are found in North America, including the United States and Canada, but not exclusively in those regions. The Sea Otter is the largest member of the weasel family, not the smallest marine mammal. The Shortfin Mako Shark is indeed one of the fastest sharks. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of animal species and their characteristics, requiring accurate factual recall. All options intentionally contain incorrect information to increase the difficulty level.


**19. Consider the following pairs:**

   River System                   Inhabitant
1.  Ganga and Brahmaputra Rivers :   Ganges River Dolphin
2.  Ganga and Indus Rivers        :   Shortfin Mako Shark
3.  Godavari and Krishna Rivers    :   Olive ridley turtle


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ganga and Brahmaputra river systems are indeed habitats for the Ganges River Dolphin.  The Shortfin Mako Shark is a marine species, not found in river systems like the Ganga and Indus. Olive ridley turtles are marine species and are not primarily found in the Godavari and Krishna rivers. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of aquatic animal habitats, requiring accurate ecological knowledge. The distractors include marine species in river systems to test the candidate’s understanding of habitats.

(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Anamudi Peak is the highest peak in South India and is located within the Western Ghats in Kerala (Pair 1 is correct). Dudhsagar Falls is a prominent waterfall located in Goa (Pair 4 is correct). Lonar Lake, a saline soda lake, is located in Maharashtra (Pair 5 is correct).  Pulicat Lake is primarily in Andhra Pradesh, not Tamil Nadu (Pair 2 is incorrect). The Shevroy Hills are located in Tamil Nadu, not Karnataka (Pair 3 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall and requires the candidate to have specific geographical knowledge of Indian states. The distractors are designed to be plausible, drawing on locations near the correct ones.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Committee             Focus Area/Responsibility
    1.  IUCN                                  :   Conservation Status of Ganges River Dolphin
    2. CITES                                 :   Regulation of International Trade in Indian Star Tortoise

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) is the global authority on the conservation status of species, including the Ganges River Dolphin (Pair 1 is correct). CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) regulates international trade in endangered species, including the Indian Star Tortoise (Pair 2 is correct). The WGEEP (Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel) was specifically tasked with studying the biodiversity and ecological issues of the Western Ghats (Pair 3 is correct). The NBA (National Biodiversity Authority) advises the State Governments on the selection and management of Biodiversity Heritage Sites (BHS) (Pair 4 is correct).  All the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall of the roles and functions of significant environmental organizations.  The inclusion of all correct pairs increases the difficulty level and discourages simple guessing.


**3. Consider the following statements:**

    1.  The Miyawaki method is primarily used for afforestation in urban areas.
    2.  The Miyawaki method involves planting saplings close together.
    3.  Mature Miyawaki forests are highly susceptible to drought.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Miyawaki method is a highly efficient technique for creating dense, native forests, particularly suitable for urban environments due to its space-saving and low-maintenance nature after establishment (Statement 1 is correct). A key aspect of the Miyawaki method is the close planting of saplings, fostering competition and rapid vertical growth (Statement 2 is correct).  However, mature Miyawaki forests, due to their dense structure and deep root systems, are generally *resistant* to drought, not susceptible (Statement 3 is incorrect). This question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to evaluate the characteristics of a specific afforestation technique.  The inclusion of a partially correct statement (Statement 3) adds complexity.


**4. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

    1.  The Western Ghats are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
    2.  The Western Ghats are characterized by high rainfall on the western side due to the windward effect.
    3.  The Western Ghats experience a tropical humid climate throughout their extent.
    4.  The Western Ghats entirely lie within the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Western Ghats are indeed a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Statement 1 is correct). The orographic effect of the Western Ghats causes significantly higher rainfall on their western slopes compared to the eastern side (Statement 2 is correct). However, the climate of the Western Ghats is not uniformly tropical humid; it varies with altitude and location, encompassing diverse climatic zones (Statement 3 is incorrect).  Furthermore, the Western Ghats extend beyond Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, encompassing parts of Maharashtra, Goa, and Gujarat (Statement 4 is incorrect). This question tests factual knowledge and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to differentiate between accurate and partially correct information.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible.

    2. Tamil Nadu      Cauvery River
    3. Karnataka       Sharavathi River
    4. Goa             Mandovi River
    5. Maharashtra    Krishna River

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Periyar River originates in the Western Ghats within Kerala (Pair 1 is correct). The Cauvery River's origins are also in the Western Ghats, within Tamil Nadu (Pair 2 is correct). The Sharavathi River's source is in the Western Ghats of Karnataka (Pair 3 is correct).  However, the Mandovi River originates within Goa but not directly from the Western Ghats; its source is in the Western Ghats but flows through the Western Ghats (Pair 4 is incorrect). The Krishna River's origin is in the Western Ghats, but it is not primarily associated with Goa (Pair 5 is incorrect). This question demands detailed knowledge of river systems and their origins, testing both factual recall and analytical skills.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the subtleties of river origins.




These questions demonstrate a variety of difficulty levels and assess several cognitive skills, aligning with the requirements of a UPSC-style examination.  The distractors are carefully constructed to make the questions challenging yet fair.  Remember to consult reliable sources for further information on these topics.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the facts presented, requiring accurate recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country          |  Significant Event Related to World War II
   -----------------|----------------------------------------
   1. India          |  Enactment of the Defence of India ordinance
   2. Japan          |  Formation of the Indian National Army
   3. Britain        |  Subhas Chandra Bose's escape to Germany
   4. Germany        |  The Cripps Mission
   5. United States |  Post-war economic boom

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Defence of India ordinance was indeed enacted in India during World War II, granting the British government extensive powers to suppress dissent and control resources.  Subhas Chandra Bose's escape to Germany, and subsequently his collaboration with the Axis powers, was a significant event of World War II that impacted India's political landscape. The post-war economic boom in the United States was a direct consequence of its involvement in the war, as it emerged as a global superpower.

Option (a) is incorrect because while the INA was formed, it was primarily under Japanese influence, not solely a Japanese initiative. Option (c) is incorrect because the Cripps Mission occurred *during* World War II but was a British initiative to seek Indian support, not a direct consequence of German actions in the war. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Germany and the Cripps mission.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization  |   Activity related to World War II
   -----------------|----------------------------------------
   1. British government | Use of  Indian resources for war efforts
   2. Indian National Congress |  Unconditional support for the Allied powers
   3.  Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army |  Cooperation with the Axis powers
   4.  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) |  Post-war reconstruction efforts
   5.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |   Provision of aid to Britain during the war


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The British government undeniably exploited India's resources during World War II for its war efforts.  Subhas Chandra Bose's INA actively cooperated with the Axis powers, representing a significant challenge to British rule. The FAO played a vital role in post-war reconstruction efforts, focusing on food security and agricultural development across the globe.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in the pairings. The Indian National Congress did *not* offer unconditional support to the Allied powers; there was significant internal debate and division on this issue. The UNDP was not involved in providing direct aid to Britain during World War II; its formation came much later.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country       |   Role in World War II
    ---------------|--------------------------------
    1. United Kingdom |  Major Allied Power
    2. Germany      |  Member of the Axis Powers
    3. Japan        |  Neutral Nation
    4.  Soviet Union |  Initially neutral, later joined the Allied powers
    5. India         |  Provided significant military and material support to the Allied powers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The United Kingdom was a central player in the Allied forces, leading the war effort alongside the United States and the Soviet Union. Germany was a principal member of the Axis powers, initiating the war in Europe. The Soviet Union, initially non-belligerent, strategically joined the Allied powers later in the war. India, under British rule, was compelled to provide considerable military personnel and resources to the Allied war effort.

Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing of India and its support for the Allied powers. Option (c) is incomplete, lacking the correct pairings of Germany and the Soviet Union. Option (d) is incorrect as Japan was a major Axis power, not a neutral nation during World War II.


**4.  With reference to the impact of World War II on India, consider the following pairs:**

    Event                                     |    Consequence
    -----------------------------------------|----------------------------------
    1.  Increased demand for Indian resources |   Economic hardship for the Indian population
    2.  The Cripps Mission                    |   Failure to secure complete Indian independence
    3.  Formation of the Indian National Army |   Rise of nationalist sentiment against British rule
    4.  Post-war famine                       |   Increased mortality rates
    5.  The Quit India Movement               |   Strengthening of the Indian independence movement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The war's increased demand for Indian resources led to widespread economic hardship as local needs were neglected. The formation of the INA, led by Subhas Chandra Bose, dramatically increased nationalist sentiment and resistance against British rule. The post-war famine, exacerbated by the war's disruptions, resulted in a significant rise in mortality. The Quit India Movement, although predating the war's end, was a crucial event that further strengthened the momentum of the Indian independence movement.

Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correct consequences of the post-war famine and the Quit India Movement. Option (b) is incomplete, leaving out the effects of resource demands and the INA. Option (d) wrongly suggests that the Cripps Mission resulted in complete independence for India; it failed to do so.  The Cripps Mission, while important, did not lead to immediate independence.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Finance is the nodal ministry responsible for the enforcement and amendment of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.  This act aims to combat money laundering and terrorist financing within the country. The Finance Commission is a constitutional body that advises the President on the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States.  The Union Budget, a crucial financial document, falls under the purview of the Finance Commission's recommendations and is prepared by the Ministry of Finance. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is a part of the Ministry of Finance and is responsible for administering direct taxes, but it doesn't directly enact or notify FDI rules. Those are primarily the domain of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, often in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, a constitutional body, is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the GST framework, but the IFSC Act is primarily under the Ministry of Finance's jurisdiction. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                |  Function/Responsibility
   ---------------------------------|-------------------------
   1. Ministry of Finance           |  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
   2. Insurance Division             |  Union Budget
   3. Finance Commission             |  FDI rules
   4. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) |  Special Scheme for financial assistance to States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, a financial inclusion scheme aimed at extending banking services to the underbanked population.  The Insurance Division, a part of the Ministry of Finance, deals with insurance-related policies and regulations, but does not directly prepare the Union Budget; that is a broader Ministry of Finance responsibility. The Finance Commission doesn't directly deal with FDI rules; that's primarily the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's area of expertise,  although the Finance Ministry is involved in the financial aspects. The CBIC, under the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for indirect taxes and customs, and plays a role in the implementation of schemes offering financial assistance to states. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Metric                     |  Custodian Organization
   ---------------------------------|-------------------------
   1. Food Loss Index (FLI)          |  World Bank
   2. Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) | Food and Agriculture Organization
   3. Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) | World Economic Forum


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Loss Index (FLI) is a metric developed and maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to measure the extent of food loss across different stages of the food supply chain. The Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and assesses the competitiveness of countries in the travel and tourism sector. The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is indeed published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), not the World Economic Forum. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     |  Published Report
   ---------------------------------|-------------------------
   1. World Health Organization (WHO) |  World Malaria Report
   2. International Solar Alliance (ISA) |  World Solar Report
   3. International Monetary Fund (IMF) |  Global Financial Stability Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) is indeed the organization that publishes the World Malaria Report, providing global data and analysis on malaria prevalence and control efforts. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) publishes the World Solar Report, focusing on the global expansion of solar energy and its impact. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) regularly releases the Global Financial Stability Report, analyzing risks and vulnerabilities in the global financial system.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Case/Report                     |  Associated Theme/Issue
   ---------------------------------|-------------------------
   1. Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India Case |  Preventive Detention Act
   2.  Sreedharan Committee Report   |  Railway Reforms
   3. World Soil Day 2024 Theme    |  Sustainable Tourism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India case is a landmark legal challenge concerning internet shutdowns in India, not the Preventive Detention Act.  The Sreedharan Committee was appointed to review and recommend reforms in the Indian Railways, making the second pair correctly matched.  The theme of World Soil Day 2024 focuses on soil health and management, not sustainable tourism. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


These questions demonstrate the application of factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills, testing the candidate's understanding of various organizations, their functions, and relevant policies.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible yet incorrect, making the questions challenging for UPSC aspirants.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Award                                      Recipient  
1. Padma Shri                               :  Tulsi Gowda
2. Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development : Michelle Bachelet
3. Padma Bhushan                             : Kazi Nazrul Islam
4. Ramon Magsaysay Award                    :  Alluri Sitarama Raju


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Tulsi Gowda, a renowned environmentalist, was indeed awarded the Padma Shri.  Michelle Bachelet, the former President of Chile, received the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development.  These two pairings are factually accurate.  Option (c) is incorrect because, while Kazi Nazrul Islam received the Padma Bhushan, the award was conferred posthumously, significantly after his death and not in the same timeframe as the other awards listed.  Option (d) is incorrect because Alluri Sitarama Raju is not associated with the Ramon Magsaysay Award. The Ramon Magsaysay Award is given to individuals or organizations in Asia that have made significant contributions to social service. While Raju was a prominent freedom fighter, there is no historical record of him receiving this award. The other options are incorrect as they include incorrect pairings of awards and recipients, based on established historical records and award databases.  The question tests factual recall of significant individuals and the awards they received.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                                     Position/Achievement
1. Indira Gandhi                             :  Prime Minister of India
2. Narendra Modi                             : Chief Minister of Gujarat
3. Veronica Michelle Bachelet Jeria         :  President of Chile
4.  Lal Bahadur Shastri                     : Member, Constituent Assembly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Indira Gandhi served as the Prime Minister of India, and Narendra Modi served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat. These are well-established facts. Option (b) is incorrect because while Veronica Michelle Bachelet Jeria was President of Chile, this fact is not directly related to the other items in the list and doesn't create a cohesive set of information. Option (c) is incorrect because Lal Bahadur Shastri was Prime Minister of India, not a member of the Constituent Assembly.  His role was primarily at the national level as Prime Minister, and his association with the Constituent Assembly is not a prominent or widely known fact. Option (d) is incorrect because it combines the correct pairs with incorrect information. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Indian and international political figures and their positions held.  It also assesses the ability to differentiate between prominent and less-prominent roles. The distractors test the awareness of political figures and their roles.


**3. With reference to Indian literature and awards, consider the following pairs:**

   Award                                     Recipient
1. Jnanpith Award                           : Jagadguru Swami Rambhadracharya
2. Dada Saheb Phalke Award                 : Gulzar
3. Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award   : Raja Ravi Varma


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Jagadguru Swami Rambhadracharya was indeed awarded the Jnanpith Award. This is verifiable information. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because Gulzar is associated with the Jnanpith award and Raja Ravi Varma is not associated with the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award.  The Dada Saheb Phalke Award is the highest award in Indian cinema, and while Gulzar is a celebrated filmmaker and poet, he is not known for receiving the Dada Saheb Phalke Award. Raja Ravi Varma was a significant painter, and the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award is the highest sporting honor in India; these two are not linked. The question tests factual knowledge about Indian literary awards and recipients. It also tests the ability to distinguish between different award categories and their recipients. The distractors are designed to test knowledge of prominent figures in Indian art and literature.



**4. With reference to Indian tribal communities, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/Region
1. Warli Tribe                              : Maharashtra
2. Kutia Kondh Tribe                       : Odisha
3. Bru Tribe                                : Tripura
4. Chenchu Tribe                            : Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Warli tribe is primarily located in Maharashtra, the Kutia Kondh tribe in Odisha, and the Bru tribe in Tripura. The Chenchu tribe is largely found in Andhra Pradesh. All four pairings are accurate based on established ethnographic data.  The question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of prominent Indian tribal groups. The inclusion of all four pairs as correct options ensures that the question is challenging and tests detailed knowledge, not just superficial awareness.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge about the distribution of various tribal groups across different states.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
1. The Chotanagpur Tenancy Act, 1908       :  Restricted land transfer from tribals to non-tribals
2. Madras Forest Act, 1882                   :  Promoted Podu cultivation
3.  National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021 : Addresses issues related to snakebite
4.  Act East Policy                            :  Focuses on environmental conservation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Chotanagpur Tenancy Act of 1908 was indeed enacted to restrict land alienation from tribal communities to non-tribal individuals. This is a well-documented fact in the history of tribal land rights in India. Option (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the Madras Forest Act, 1882, actually restricted traditional Podu cultivation, not promoted it.  The National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021, does not specifically address snakebite; it focuses on rare diseases in general. The Act East Policy is a foreign policy initiative, not directly related to environmental conservation in India, though it may indirectly support such efforts.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific legislation impacting tribal communities and the key features of national policies.  The distractors are designed to test the understanding of the actual effects of various policies and legislation.


**6. With reference to significant events and personalities, consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                     Person
1. Rampa Rebellion                          :  Kazi Nazrul Islam
2. Ulgulan Movement                         :  Birsa Munda
3.  Non-Cooperation Movement              :  Alluri Sitarama Raju
4.  India's Independence                    :  Mahatma Gandhi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Birsa Munda led the Ulgulan movement, a significant tribal rebellion against British rule. Alluri Sitarama Raju was indeed influenced by and participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement. Mahatma Gandhi's leadership was instrumental in India's struggle for independence.  These three pairings are historically accurate. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because Kazi Nazrul Islam is not directly associated with the Rampa Rebellion.  While his poetry was revolutionary and anti-British, his activities did not directly involve this specific rebellion.  The other options incorrectly pair events and individuals based on historical records. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of historical events and the prominent personalities associated with them, demanding a nuanced understanding of the Indian freedom struggle and tribal movements. The distractors are designed to test knowledge about various aspects of the Indian freedom struggle and the roles played by different leaders.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Language                                   Key Feature
1. Kui Language                              :  Odia Script
2. Madhika Language                          :  Tibeto-Burman family
3.  Kaubru Language                          :  Spoken by the Kutia Kondh Tribe
4.  Bengali Language                         :  Boisakh calendar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kui language does utilize the Odia script.  This is a known fact about its linguistic features.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because Madhika language is not part of the Tibeto-Burman family; it's a Dravidian language blend. Kaubru is the language of the Bru tribe, not the Kutia Kondh tribe. The Bengali language is not directly associated with the Boisakh calendar; although the Boisakh festival is celebrated by Bengali people, that doesn't make it a defining feature of the language. The question tests knowledge of lesser-known Indian languages, their scripts, and the communities that speak them. The distractors test knowledge of language families and the cultural contexts of different languages.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                     Key Feature
1. Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) :  Founded in 1950 by Jawaharlal Nehru
2. Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust             :  Confers the Annapurna Certificate
3.  Archaeological Survey of India           :  Has site museums at various locations
4.  Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation       : Honors individuals for social contributions in Asia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Archaeological Survey of India does maintain site museums across numerous locations in India.  The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation is known for recognizing individuals and organizations for their outstanding contributions to Asian society. These two pairings are factually correct. Option (a) is incorrect because the ICCR was founded by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, not Jawaharlal Nehru. Option (b) is incorrect because the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust confers the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development, not the Annapurna Certificate. Option (c) is incorrect as it combines one correct pairing with an incorrect one.  The question tests knowledge of various Indian and international organizations, their functions, and their areas of operation. The distractors are carefully designed to mislead candidates who have only superficial knowledge of these organizations.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Activity/Focus
1. World Health Organization (WHO)             :   Declaration on a Global Climate Finance Framework
2. Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)         :   Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards
3. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC):  COVID-19 pandemic response


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) plays a significant role in international health governance and actively participates in discussions and declarations related to global health issues, including climate change and its impact on health.  The Declaration on a Global Climate Finance Framework is a relevant area of concern for the WHO, as climate change exacerbates existing health problems and creates new ones. The WHO's involvement reflects its commitment to addressing the broader determinants of health, including environmental factors.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While the WHO defines Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards for pharmaceutical products, these standards are primarily developed and managed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), a joint body of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the WHO. The CAC is the primary authority for setting international food standards, including GMP.  The WHO collaborates with the CAC, but the CAC is the lead organization in this context.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the leading international organization addressing global health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it does not solely manage or "own" the response. The COVID-19 pandemic response involved a multitude of organizations, governments, and individuals working collaboratively at national, regional, and global levels.  Attributing the entire response to the WHO is an oversimplification and an inaccurate portrayal of the complex global effort.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Characteristic/Association
1. Jordan                                        :   Zero malaria deaths since 2015
2. Belize                                         :   Recognized by WHO as malaria-free
3. India                                          :   Half of all estimated malaria cases in the WHO South-East Asia Region in 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correctly matched.  The World Health Organization (WHO) certifies countries as malaria-free based on rigorous epidemiological data demonstrating the sustained absence of locally acquired malaria cases for a specified period.  Belize has achieved this certification.

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The WHO's World Malaria Report provides data on malaria incidence and prevalence globally and regionally.  Based on this data, India has been identified as accounting for a substantial portion (half) of malaria cases within the WHO South-East Asia Region in a given year.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While some countries have achieved zero malaria deaths, the statement is not true for Jordan.  The WHO's data on malaria mortality varies by country and year, and it's crucial to consult the latest reports for accurate information.  Attributing zero malaria deaths to a specific country without specifying the year can be misleading. The prompt might be trying to confuse you with countries that have made significant progress in reducing malaria.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Data                                 Published by
1. Sodium benchmarks                             :   Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)
2. Report ‘Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)’ :  UNICEF
3. Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2024 :   World Health Organization (WHO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correctly matched.  The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) conducts extensive research and publishes reports on various aspects of child health and well-being, including those related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).  Reports on the burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH conditions are a key area of UNICEF's work.

Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect. The WHO publishes data and reports on various health indicators, including sodium intake and its associated health risks. However, the specific data on "sodium benchmarks" is not solely published by the WHO.  Multiple organizations, including governmental and non-governmental bodies, contribute to the development and dissemination of such benchmarks. Similarly, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), not the WHO, publishes the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons.  The WHO's involvement in combating human trafficking is through collaborations with other UN agencies like UNODC, but the UNODC is the primary publisher of the report.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                      Focus Area/Description
1. International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) :   Green shipping and digitization
2.  Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative     :   Combating illicit drugs and international crime
3. Panch Karma Sankalp                          :   Improving connectivity between Armenia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Georgia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The "Crossroads of Peace" connectivity plan explicitly aims to enhance regional connectivity by improving infrastructure and opening borders between Armenia and its neighbors, including Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Georgia. This reflects a broader initiative to improve regional integration and economic development.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is a multi-modal transportation network connecting India, Iran, and Russia, aiming to improve trade and connectivity between these countries. While there may be aspects of the INSTC that could incorporate elements of green shipping and digitization, these are not the primary or defining characteristics of the INSTC.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The WHO proposes the Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative, a public health initiative aimed at reducing the global burden of cervical cancer through improved screening, vaccination, and treatment programs.  Combating illicit drugs and international crime is the focus of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Agreement              Key Feature/Objective
1. Paris Agreement                             :   Reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030
2.  Stockholm Convention                        :   Addressing  hazardous wastes
3.  Montreal Protocol                           :   Reducing GHG emissions from ships


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correctly matched. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) is a global environmental treaty focused on eliminating or significantly reducing the production and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment.  These are substances that are hazardous, persistent, and bioaccumulative, posing significant risks to human health and the environment.  Hazardous waste management is a central theme of the convention.

Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect.  The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.  While it encourages national emission reduction targets, the specific 55% reduction by 2030 target is associated with the EU's Fit for 55 package, not the Paris Agreement itself. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), not the Montreal Protocol,  has adopted a strategy to reduce GHG emissions from ships. The Montreal Protocol focuses primarily on the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Specific Initiative/Program
1. Gabon                                        :   Green Deal Industrial Plan
2.  Ecuador                                      :   National Hydrogen Mission
3. India                                          :   Debt for Nature Swap


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correctly matched. Ecuador is involved in debt-for-nature swaps, notably a large-scale initiative for ocean conservation.  Debt-for-nature swaps involve a country using its external debt payments to fund domestic conservation projects.

Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect.  The European Union (EU) unveiled its Green Deal Industrial Plan, not Gabon.  India has not been involved in debt-for-nature swaps to date. The  National Hydrogen Mission is an Indian initiative.  The question is designed to test the candidate's knowledge of specific national and international environmental and economic initiatives and their associations with particular countries.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes the question challenging.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Body             Action/Focus
1. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) :   Green Voyage 2050 project
2. International Maritime Organization (IMO):   Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS)
3.  European Union (EU)                         :   Fit for 55 package


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The European Union's (EU) Fit for 55 package is a comprehensive set of policy proposals aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. It includes measures across various sectors, such as energy, transport, and industry.

Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is a key player in international climate science and services, but the Green Voyage 2050 project is an initiative of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) was launched by the WMO, but it is a collaborative initiative involving numerous organizations and countries, not solely the IMO.  The question tests understanding of international organizations and their specific initiatives in the context of climate change and sustainable development.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                    Key Recent Development/Initiative
1.  India                                        :   Debt for Climate Swaps
2.  Gabon                                        :   Debt for Nature Swap
3.  Philippines                                  :   Green Deal Industrial Plan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correctly matched. Gabon recently announced a significant debt-for-nature swap, representing one of the largest such initiatives in Africa. Debt-for-nature swaps are financial mechanisms where a country's external debt is converted into local currency to finance environmental conservation projects.

Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect. India has not yet participated in a debt-for-nature swap. The Green Deal Industrial Plan is a European Union initiative, not a national initiative of the Philippines.  The question tests knowledge of specific national and international initiatives related to debt swaps and sustainable development.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Role/Function
1.  International Maritime Organization (IMO)    :    Indian Carbon Market (ICM) administration
2.  Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)           :    Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships
3.  World Climate Research Programme           :   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6) is a major international climate modeling project coordinated by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).  It involves a large-scale collaboration of scientists using climate models to understand climate change and its impacts.

Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect.  The Indian Carbon Market (ICM) is administered by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), a governmental agency in India. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, not the BEE.  The question assesses knowledge of international and national organizations and their roles in climate change mitigation and environmental management.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                      Energy Initiative/Policy
1. India                                          :   Fit for 55 package
2. European Union (EU)                         :   Panch Karma Sankalp
3. Gabon                                          :   Debt for Nature Swap


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 3 is correctly matched.  Gabon has implemented a debt-for-nature swap, a financial mechanism used to channel debt repayments into environmental protection initiatives.

Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect. The Fit for 55 package is an EU initiative, not an Indian one.  The Panch Karma Sankalp is an Indian initiative focused on green shipping and digitization, not an EU policy. The question tests knowledge of national and international climate policies and their association with specific countries.  The distractors are plausible, increasing the question's difficulty.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Location          Product Exported from China
    1.  China                         :   Raw silk
    2.  China                         :   Porcelain
    3.  India                          :   Spices
    4.  China                         :   Tea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

China has a long and rich history associated with the production and export of raw silk, a significant contributor to the Silk Road trade.  Porcelain, another iconic Chinese product, was also widely exported, establishing China's reputation for fine craftsmanship and artistry. Similarly, tea, originating in China, became a globally consumed beverage, with China being a major exporter.  Option (d) is incorrect because while India did export spices, this is not directly related to a product exported *from* China. The question specifically asks about products exported *from* China. Options (a) and (b) are partially correct but incomplete, failing to include the correctly matched pair of China and Tea.  The inclusion of India as an exporter of spices acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between the origin and export of goods, a crucial aspect of understanding global trade dynamics.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Location          Origin of Technology
    1.  China                         :   Paper manufacturing
    2.  China                         :   Gunpowder
    3.  India                          :   Cotton cultivation
    4.  Mesopotamia                  :   Wheel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

China is widely acknowledged as the origin of paper manufacturing, a technological advancement with profound implications for communication and record-keeping. Similarly, gunpowder, a transformative invention with military and social implications, also originated in China. Option (d) is incorrect because the wheel's invention predates recorded history and is attributed to various early civilizations, with no single definitive origin.  Option (c) is partially correct, but wrongly includes India’s cotton cultivation, which is not related to the origin of technology. The inclusion of Mesopotamia and the wheel acts as a distractor, testing knowledge beyond the immediate topic and demanding precise factual recall about the origins of key technologies.  Options (a) and (b) test the candidate’s ability to identify accurate pairings amidst plausible but ultimately incorrect distractors.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                  Ranked Higher in Military Spending than
    1.  China                   :   India
    2.  United States            :   Russia
    3.  India                    :   Pakistan
    4.  Russia                   :   China

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

China consistently ranks among the top countries globally in terms of military spending, significantly surpassing India's expenditure. The United States also maintains a substantially higher military budget than Russia.  India's military spending also exceeds that of Pakistan. Option (d) is incorrect because  Russia's military spending does not surpass that of China,  a crucial detail that differentiates the correct answer from the distractor. Options (a) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete, thereby testing the candidate's ability to accurately assess multiple pairings. The inclusion of seemingly plausible but factually incorrect pairings necessitates careful evaluation and precise knowledge of global military expenditure trends.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                      Traded With
    1.  China                       :   India
    2.  China                       :   Soviet Union
    3.  India                        :   Nepal
    4.  United States              :   China

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

China and India have a long history of trade relations, exchanging goods and services across various sectors.  China also engaged in extensive trade with the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. India and Nepal, geographically close and sharing cultural ties, also maintain significant bilateral trade.  The United States and China are major players in global trade, engaging in extensive bilateral trade despite their geopolitical differences. All pairs are factually accurate representations of existing trade relations between the named countries.  The inclusion of several pairs with geographically close nations acts as a distractor, requiring the examinee to focus on precise information and avoid making assumptions based on proximity.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country               Major Exporter Of
    1.  China               :   Silk
    2.  India                :   Spices
    3.  China               :   Porcelain
    4.  Brazil               :   Coffee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

China is historically and currently a major exporter of silk, a product deeply interwoven with its culture and economy.  India is a major exporter of spices, reflecting its diverse agricultural landscape and traditional practices. China also holds a prominent position as a major exporter of porcelain, reflecting its long-standing mastery of ceramic production.  Brazil is a major exporter of coffee, a commodity central to its economy. All the pairs provided are correctly matched. The inclusion of well-known exporting countries and products acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to carefully evaluate each pair and recall accurate information, rather than relying on general knowledge.  The option format also requires careful consideration of each pair.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Historical Figure           Associated Movement/Rebellion
1. Alluri Sitarama Raju        :       Indigo Revolt
2. Birsa Munda                :       Santhal Rebellion
3. Kanhu Murmu                :       Kol Rebellion
4. Sidhu                       :       Munda Uprising

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because Birsa Munda and Sidhu are correctly linked to their respective rebellions. Birsa Munda was a prominent leader of the Munda Uprising, a tribal revolt against British rule in present-day Jharkhand. Sidhu, along with Kanhu Murmu, led the Santhal Rebellion, another significant tribal uprising against British land policies and exploitative practices in the Bengal Presidency.  Option (a) is incorrect as Alluri Sitarama Raju is associated with the Rampa Rebellion, not the Indigo Revolt.  The Indigo Revolt was primarily a peasant uprising against indigo planters in Bengal. Option (b) is partially correct (2 is correct) but incorrectly links Kanhu Murmu to the Kol Rebellion. While Kanhu was a leader of the Santhal Rebellion, the Kol Rebellion was a separate tribal movement in Chota Nagpur. Option (d) is incorrect as it only includes Sidhu, neglecting Birsa Munda's crucial role in the Munda Uprising.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Painting Style              Region of Origin
1. Madhubani Painting        :       Rajasthan
2. Warli Painting            :       Gujarat
3. Kalamkari Painting        :       Bihar
4. Tanjore Painting          :       Orissa

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d) because none of the pairs are correctly matched. Madhubani painting originates from Bihar, not Rajasthan. Warli painting is from Maharashtra, not Gujarat. Kalamkari painting's origin is Andhra Pradesh, not Bihar.  Tanjore painting is a style from Tamil Nadu, not Orissa. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical origins of various Indian painting styles.  All the distractors are plausible, representing painting styles from different regions of India, making the question challenging.  The incorrect pairings highlight potential misconceptions about the geographical distribution of these art forms.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Historical Event           Prominent Leader
1. Rampa Rebellion           :        Alluri Sitarama Raju
2. Pabna Revolt               :        Jogendra Nath Mondal
3. Indigo Revolt              :        Digambar Biswas
4. Santhal Rebellion          :        Titu Mir

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion, and Jogendra Nath Mondal was a key figure in the Pabna Revolt.  Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the correctly matched pair of the Rampa Rebellion. Option (c) is partially correct (1 and 2 are correct), but incorrectly attributes the Indigo Revolt to Digambar Biswas. While the Indigo Revolt had many leaders, Digambar Biswas wasn't a prominent one.  Option (d) is completely incorrect, misattributing the Santhal Rebellion to Titu Mir. Titu Mir was associated with a different rebellion in Bengal. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various rebellions during British rule in India and their respective leaders. The inclusion of less well-known figures like Jogendra Nath Mondal and Digambar Biswas adds to the difficulty level.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Socio-Cultural Reform Movement      Prominent Figure
1. Brahmo Samaj                      :       Swami Dayanand Saraswati
2. Arya Samaj                        :       Raja Ram Mohan Roy
3. Prarthana Samaj                    :       Atmaram Pandurang
4. Theosophical Society               :       Annie Besant

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Atmaram Pandurang was a key figure in the Prarthana Samaj, a reformist movement in Maharashtra. Annie Besant played a significant role in the Theosophical Society, promoting its ideals in India.  Option (a) incorrectly links Brahmo Samaj with Swami Dayanand Saraswati; the Brahmo Samaj was founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, while Swami Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj. Option (c) is partially correct (3 is correct) but incorrectly pairs Raja Ram Mohan Roy with the Arya Samaj. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pairs.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various socio-cultural reform movements in 19th-century India and their leading personalities.  The inclusion of less prominent figures like Atmaram Pandurang adds to the difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Temple                           Location
1. Dwarkadhish Temple               :       Uttarakhand
2. Badrinath Temple                 :       Gujarat
3. Jagannath Temple                 :       Odisha
4. Ramanathaswamy Temple           :       Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Jagannath Temple is located in Puri, Odisha, and the Ramanathaswamy Temple is situated in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. Option (a) is incorrect; Dwarkadhish Temple is in Gujarat, not Uttarakhand. Option (c) is partially correct (3 is correct) but incorrectly places Badrinath Temple in Gujarat; it is in Uttarakhand.  Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the geographical locations of prominent Hindu temples in India. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect locations increases the difficulty level.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cave System                     State/Region
1. Ajanta Caves                    :       Andhra Pradesh
2. Elephanta Caves                  :       Karnataka
3. Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves :       Odisha
4. Ellora Caves                     :       Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option 3 is correctly matched. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves are located in Odisha. Option (a) is incorrect as the Ajanta Caves are in Maharashtra, not Andhra Pradesh.  Option (c) is incorrect; Elephanta Caves are in Maharashtra, not Karnataka, and Ellora Caves are in Maharashtra, not Tamil Nadu. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes all the incorrectly matched pairs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical location of famous rock-cut cave systems in India. The incorrect options use plausible but incorrect locations, making the question challenging.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                      Associated Harappan Site
1. Indus River                :       Lothal
2. Saraswati River           :       Mohenjo-daro
3. Ravi River                 :       Harappa
4. Ghaggar-Hakra River      :       Rakhigarhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Harappa is located on the Ravi River, and Rakhigarhi is situated on the Ghaggar-Hakra River. Option (a) is incorrect as Lothal is associated with the Sabarmati River, not the Indus River, and Mohenjo-daro is primarily associated with the Indus River. Option (c) is partially correct (3 is correct) but incorrectly pairs the Indus with Lothal. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pairs.  This question tests factual knowledge about the location of major Harappan sites in relation to the rivers of the Indus Valley Civilization.  The incorrect options provide plausible, yet incorrect, pairings, increasing the difficulty level.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Person                        Title/Position
1.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy          :     First Governor-General of India
2.  Gopal Krishna Gokhale       :     President, Indian National Congress
3.  Mahatma Gandhi              :     Founder, Servants of India Society
4.  Vishwanath Pratap Singh     :     Prime Minister of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correctly matched pairs are 2 and 4. Gopal Krishna Gokhale served as the President of the Indian National Congress, and Vishwanath Pratap Singh was a Prime Minister of India. Option (b) is incorrect as Raja Ram Mohan Roy was not the first Governor-General of India (that was Lord William Bentinck), and Mahatma Gandhi did not found the Servants of India Society (that was Gopal Krishna Gokhale). Option (c) is partially correct (2 and 4 are correct) but incorrectly attributes the founding of the Servants of India Society to Mahatma Gandhi. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes all the incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of prominent Indian figures and their roles in history and politics.  The incorrect options present plausible but incorrect positions, increasing the complexity.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Festival                     State/Region
1. Hornbill Festival           :       Assam
2. Kati Bihu                   :       Tripura
3. Kharchi Puja                :       Nagaland
4. Ambubachi Mela             :       Assam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Hornbill Festival is associated with Nagaland, and Ambubachi Mela is celebrated in Assam. Option (b) is incorrect as Kati Bihu is celebrated in Assam, not Tripura, and Kharchi Puja is a festival of Tripura, not Nagaland. Option (c) is partially correct (4 is correct) but incorrectly pairs Kharchi Puja with Nagaland. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes all the incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various festivals celebrated in different regions of India.  The incorrect options use plausible but incorrect locations for the festivals, making the question challenging.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                        Region
1.  Hakki Pikki                 :       Odisha
2.  Muthuvan                    :       Kerala
3.  Shompen                     :       Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  Koya                         :       Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Shompen tribe resides in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and the Koya tribe is found in Andhra Pradesh. Option (a) is incorrect as Hakki Pikki are primarily located in Karnataka, not Odisha, and Muthuvan are from Kerala. Option (c) is partially correct (4 is correct) but incorrectly pairs Hakki Pikki with Odisha. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes all the incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the geographical distribution of various tribal communities in India.  Plausible but incorrect pairings increase the difficulty level and assess detailed knowledge.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                      Movement/Association
    1. Ram Prasad Bismil           :   Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
    2. Chandra Shekhar Azad       :   Kakori Train Robbery
    3. Alluri Sitarama Raju        :   Rampa Rebellion
    4. Bhagat Singh                :   Indian National Congress
    5. Khudiram Bose              :   Swadeshi Movement

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ram Prasad Bismil was a key member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which later evolved into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).  He participated in the Kakori Conspiracy, not the HSRA.  Chandra Shekhar Azad was indeed involved in the Kakori Train Robbery. Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion. Bhagat Singh was associated with HSRA and other revolutionary groups, not the Indian National Congress. Khudiram Bose was involved in revolutionary activities but his most significant action was not associated with the Swadeshi Movement. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the historical connections. Option (c) accurately reflects this. The other options incorrectly include personalities and movements/associations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Newspaper                Editor/Founder
    1. Kesari                    :   Gopal Krishna Gokhale
    2. Mahratta                 :   Bal Gangadhar Tilak
    3. Indian Opinion           :   M.K. Gandhi
    4. Young India               :   Gopal Hari Deshmukh
    5.  Amrita Bazar Patrika     :   Surendranath Banerjea

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3 and 5 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Basavanna was a prominent figure in the 12th-century Vira Shaiva movement, a branch of Shaivism, which is related to the Bhakti movement but not solely defined by it. Sree Narayana Guru is indeed associated with the concept of "One Caste, One Religion, One God". Periyar E.V. Ramaswami Naicker led the Self-Respect Movement. Swami Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission. Raja Ram Mohan Roy was associated with the Brahmo Samaj, not the Arya Samaj.  Thus, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are definitively correct.

Ahilyabai Holkar is known for the restoration of the Vishnupad Temple. Akbar is known for his building projects within the Mughal Empire, but not for building the Mahabodhi Temple. Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (c) accurately reflects this. The other options include at least one incorrect pairing.

The Khilafat Movement ran concurrently with the Non-Cooperation Movement. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre was a significant catalyst that fueled the Non-Cooperation Movement. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.

Tamil Nadu has a large number of Ramsar sites, but the highest number may vary. Rajasthan has a significant desert area, and often the highest percentage of desert area among all states. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 5 show a strong likelihood of being correct, while others may fluctuate. Option (c) is the most appropriate given the likely variability in the data for other pairs.

1. **Thangka Painting:** Originates from Sikkim and Ladakh, regions in the Himalayas.  It's a Tibetan Buddhist art form, not associated with Odisha.

2. **Kalamkari:**  This textile art form originates from Andhra Pradesh, not Telangana.  While both states share cultural similarities, Kalamkari's historical roots are firmly in Andhra Pradesh.

3. **Pichwai Painting:** This devotional painting style is strongly associated with Rajasthan, not Madhya Pradesh.  It's particularly linked to the Shrinathji temple tradition in Nathdwara.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option 3 is incorrect. Let's break down each pairing:

1. **Mysore Paintings and Tanjore Paintings:** Mysore paintings, while distinct, share stylistic overlaps with Tanjore paintings, particularly in their use of bright colors and gold leaf.  Both styles developed in South India, influencing each other over time.

2. **Nayaka Paintings and Kerala Murals:** The Nayaka style, particularly prevalent in South India during the Vijayanagara period, significantly influenced the vibrant and detailed style of Kerala murals.  The themes and techniques show clear connections.

3. **Vijayanagara Schools and Phad Paintings:** This pairing is incorrect.  Vijayanagara schools primarily influenced South Indian art styles, while Phad paintings are a distinct Rajasthani tradition with its own unique characteristics. There's no direct stylistic link between the two.

4. **Kalamkari and Mata ni Pachedi:** Kalamkari's distinctive style and techniques, particularly its detailed line work and use of natural dyes, are evident in the Mata ni Pachedi textile art from Gujarat. The influence is clear in the motifs and execution.


This question tests the examinee's analytical skills to identify stylistic influences in Indian art. The inclusion of the Vijayanagara style as a distractor is effective because of its widespread influence across South India, making it plausible for association with various regional styles. The correct answer showcases the nuanced understanding of art history required for success in the UPSC examination.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Art Form                     Geographical Location
    1. Warli Art                  :   Gujarat
    2. Kalamkari                  :   Andhra Pradesh
    3. Pattachitra                :   Odisha
    4. Cheriyal Painting          :   Telangana


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option 1 is incorrect.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to correctly associate art forms with their geographic origins:

1. **Warli Art and Gujarat:** This pairing is incorrect. Warli art is primarily associated with the Warli tribal community in Maharashtra, not Gujarat, although there might be some spillover or influence in neighbouring regions.

2. **Kalamkari and Andhra Pradesh:**  This is a correct pairing. Kalamkari, a type of hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile, has its roots in Andhra Pradesh.

3. **Pattachitra and Odisha:** This is correct. Pattachitra, a traditional scroll painting style, is strongly associated with Odisha.  Raghurajpur is a prominent center for this art form.

4. **Cheriyal Painting and Telangana:** This is correct. Cheriyal painting is a unique scroll painting tradition from Telangana.


The question uses the Warli tribe's location as a major distractor, as it is a well-known tribal art form, but its precise location is often confused. The question successfully differentiates between closely related geographical locations to test the examinee's precise knowledge of Indian art and geography. The correct answer highlights the importance of detailed knowledge of Indian art forms and their geographical distribution.


**4. With reference to the history of art in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Art Form                      Associated Cult/Deity
    1. Pattachitra                 :   Shakti and Shaiva cults
    2. Pichwai Painting            :   Krishna
    3.  Kerala Murals              :   Buddhist


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only options 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option 3 is incorrect.  The question tests the examinee's understanding of the religious and cultural contexts of different Indian art forms.

1. **Pattachitra and Shakti and Shaiva Cults:** Pattachitra paintings from Odisha often depict themes related to the Shakti and Shaiva cults, showcasing deities and narratives from these traditions.

2. **Pichwai Painting and Krishna:** Pichwai paintings, primarily from Rajasthan, are deeply devotional and almost exclusively focus on the deity Krishna.  They depict scenes from his life and legends.

3. **Kerala Murals and Buddhism:** This is incorrect. While some Kerala murals might depict Buddhist figures or narratives, the overwhelming majority are associated with Hindu themes and deities, particularly those related to Vaishnavism and Shaivism.


The question effectively uses the Kerala murals' association with Hinduism as a distractor, making it a challenging yet fair test of knowledge. The deliberate inclusion of a plausible incorrect option makes simple guessing difficult.  The correct answer emphasizes the importance of understanding the intricate relationship between art and religion in India.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

    1.  Marathi is currently a classical language of India.
    2.  A rich body of ancient literature is a criterion for classical language status in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; statement 1 is incorrect. The question tests factual knowledge regarding the criteria for classical language status and the current list of classical languages in India.

1. **Marathi as a Classical Language:** This statement is incorrect.  Currently, the six classical languages recognized by the Government of India are Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia. Marathi is not yet included on this list, despite having a rich literary tradition.

2. **Criterion for Classical Language Status:** This statement is correct.  The Government of India has established specific criteria for granting classical language status to a language.  A rich body of ancient literature, demonstrating antiquity and a significant contribution to the cultural heritage, is a key component of these criteria.


The question uses the prominent status of Marathi as a major language in India as a key distractor to test the examinee's familiarity with the precise criteria for classical language status. The correct answer highlights the importance of understanding government policies and classifications related to language.  The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but incorrect statement makes the question more challenging.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

     Geographical Feature              Country
1.  Amazon rainforest                  :   Venezuela
2.  Amazon rainforest                  :   Ecuador
3.  Amazon rainforest                  :   Bolivia
4.  Amazon basin                      :   Brazil
5.  Lake Titicaca                       :   Peru

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Amazon rainforest is indeed located across multiple South American countries.  Options 2, 3, and 4 correctly identify Ecuador, Bolivia, and Brazil, respectively, as countries where portions of the Amazon rainforest are situated. The Amazon basin, a larger geographical area encompassing the rainforest, is primarily located in Brazil.  Lake Titicaca is also correctly paired with Peru as it is partially located within Peru's borders.  However, option 1 is incorrect; while the Amazon rainforest extends close to Venezuela, a significant portion of the rainforest itself does not lie within Venezuela's boundaries.  Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4, along with option 5, represent accurate pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

     Country                      Economic Activity
1.  Peru                           :   Copper Production
2.  Chile                           :   Zinc Production
3.  Peru                           :   Silver Production
4.  Brazil                          :   Zinc Production
5.  Chile                           :   Silver Production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Peru is a significant producer of silver, making option 3 correct.  Chile is also a major player in global silver production, making option 5 correct.  While Peru does have zinc reserves and production, it's not the primary economic activity highlighted in the data. Similarly, Chile's copper production is more substantial than its zinc production. Brazil's significant economic activities are not primarily focused on zinc production.  Therefore, only options 3 and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

     Geographical Feature             Relationship with Amazon Rainforest
1.  Amazon basin                     :   Completely encompasses the Amazon rainforest.
2.  Madre de Dios Region             :   Partially contains the Amazon rainforest.
3.  Lake Titicaca                     :   Located within the Amazon basin.
4.  Sahara Desert                     :   Provides nutrients to the Amazon rainforest.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Amazon basin is a large area, but the Amazon rainforest does not entirely fill it; other ecosystems are present. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Madre de Dios region in Peru is indeed part of the Amazon rainforest's expanse, making statement 2 correct. Lake Titicaca is far from the Amazon basin, in the Andes Mountains, so statement 3 is false. The Sahara Desert's dust, transported by winds, does contribute nutrients to the Amazon, making statement 4 correct. However, the primary nutrient source is not the Sahara Desert, but rather other Amazonian processes. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Peru:**

1.  Lima is its capital city.
2.  It borders Chile.
3.  It is located in South America.
4.  El Niño events significantly affect its marine life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. Lima is the capital city of Peru (statement 1). Peru shares a border with Chile (statement 2). Peru is located in South America (statement 3).  The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) significantly impacts the Peruvian coastline's upwelling, affecting the marine ecosystem (statement 4). Therefore, all four statements are true.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

     City                     Country
1.  Lima                       :   Brazil
2.  New Delhi                  :   India
3.  Brasilia                    :   Peru
4.  Bogota                     :   Colombia
5.  Santiago                    :   Chile


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only three pairs are correctly matched. New Delhi is correctly paired with India (statement 2). Bogota is accurately paired with Colombia (statement 4). Santiago is correctly paired with Chile (statement 5).  However, Lima is the capital of Peru, not Brazil (statement 1 is incorrect), and Brasilia is the capital of Brazil, not Peru (statement 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only statements 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Person                      Activity
1.  Shri Narendra Modi           :   Inaugurated the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee.
2.  Chandra Shekhar Azad       :   Led the Hindustan Republican Army.
3.  Lokmanya Tilak              :   Authored the "Arctic Home in the Vedas".
4.  Basavanna                    :   Led the Bhakti movement.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Shri Narendra Modi did inaugurate the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee in New Delhi (statement 1).  Chandra Shekhar Azad was a key figure and leader in the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which later evolved into the HSRA (statement 2). Lokmanya Tilak authored "The Arctic Home in the Vedas" (statement 3).  However, Basavanna was a prominent figure in the 12th-century Lingayat movement, which was influenced by the Bhakti movement, but he did not lead the Bhakti movement itself (statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the World Heritage Committee, consider the following pairs:**

    Committee Action                    Location
1.  46th Session Inauguration        :   Hampi
2.  Inscription of Assam’s Moidams  :   New Delhi
3.  Inclusion of Saint Hilarion Monastery on the List of World Heritage in Danger  :   Gaza Strip


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 46th session of the World Heritage Committee was held in New Delhi, not Hampi, although the logo was inspired by Hampi (statement 1 is incorrect). Assam's Moidams were indeed inscribed as a World Heritage Site during the 46th session in New Delhi (statement 2 is correct). The Saint Hilarion Monastery is located in the Gaza Strip, and its inclusion on the List of World Heritage in Danger is a separate matter from the 46th Committee session (statement 3 is correct). Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Location                     Feature
1.  Mohenjo-daro                 :   Located on the left bank of the Ravi River.
2.  Lothal                       :   Located along the Bhogava River.
3.  Harappa                      :   Located off the right bank of the lower Indus River.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only Lothal is correctly matched with its location. Lothal is situated along the Bhogava River, a tributary of the Sabarmati (statement 2 is correct). Mohenjo-daro is located on the west bank of the Indus River, and Harappa is on the left bank of the Ravi River (statements 1 and 3 are incorrect).  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Temple                           Feature
1.  Mahabodhi Temple, Bodh Gaya  :   Built by Emperor Asoka in the 3rd century BC.
2.  Vishnupad Temple, Gaya        :   Located on the banks of the Falgu River.
3.  Mahabodhi Temple, Bodh Gaya  :   UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Mahabodhi Temple was not built by Emperor Asoka in the 3rd century BC; although Asoka did visit the site, the current structure dates from later centuries (statement 1 is incorrect). The Vishnupad Temple at Gaya is indeed located on the banks of the Falgu River (statement 2 is correct). The Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (statement 3 is correct).  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

     Mughal Emperor's Tomb          Feature
1. Humayun's Tomb                 :   Built by his widow, Biga Begum.
2.  Akbar's Tomb                   :   Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
3.  Jahangir's Tomb                :   Located in Lahore.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first statement is entirely accurate. Humayun's Tomb was indeed built by his widow, Biga Begum (statement 1 is correct). Akbar's Tomb, while significant, is not specifically mentioned as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the given data (statement 2 is incorrect). Jahangir's Tomb is located in Lahore, Pakistan (statement 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country          Capital City
1. Russia           Moscow
2. India            New Delhi

4. Bangladesh       Dhaka
5. Sri Lanka        Colombo

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The pair 1 (Russia-Moscow) is correctly matched. Moscow is the capital city of Russia.  Pair 2 (India-New Delhi) is also correctly matched; New Delhi serves as the capital of India. Pair 4 (Bangladesh-Dhaka) is correctly matched as Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh. Pair 5 (Sri Lanka-Colombo) is correctly matched; Colombo is the capital city of Sri Lanka.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes Russia, while other countries are also correctly paired. Option (b) omits Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which are also correctly paired. Option (c) omits Sri Lanka, which is a correctly matched pair. Therefore, only option (d) encompasses all the correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of capital cities of various countries, including some that might be considered less frequently recalled by candidates, adding to the question's difficulty.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                      Location
1. Hamas                             Gaza Strip
2. Palestinian Authority (PA)       West Bank
3.  Border Roads Organisation (BRO)   Jammu and Kashmir
4.  Indian Armed Forces              New Delhi
5.  NITI Aayog                        Mumbai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Hamas is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamist fundamentalist organization that governs the Gaza Strip, making pair 1 correct. The Palestinian Authority (PA) is the governing body of the Palestinian territories in the West Bank, making pair 2 correct.  The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) primarily operates across India's border regions, but its headquarters are in New Delhi, not Jammu and Kashmir, making pair 3 incorrect. The Indian Armed Forces' headquarters are in New Delhi, not Mumbai, making pair 4 incorrect. NITI Aayog's headquarters are in New Delhi, not Mumbai, making pair 5 incorrect.  The question tests knowledge of the locations of various organizations, including both international and domestic entities, demanding precise knowledge to avoid the distractors. Only option (b) correctly identifies the two correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country             Major Trading Partner
1. India               Russia
2. Russia              China
3. Australia           China
4. India               United States

(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India and Russia have a long-standing relationship and significant bilateral trade, making pair 1 correct. Russia and China are major trading partners, engaging in substantial economic exchange, making pair 2 correct.  Australia and China have a significant trade relationship, with Australia exporting various raw materials to China, making pair 3 correct. India and the United States are major trading partners, although the nature of their relationship is complex and involves trade deficits and surpluses in different sectors. This makes pair 4 correct. Australia and the United Kingdom historically had a close trading relationship but it has diminished over time. The UK is not currently a major trading partner for Australia, rendering pair 5 incorrect. The question tests the understanding of major trading relationships between countries, requiring knowledge beyond simply identifying trading partners.


**4.  With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following pairs:**

    BoP Component                     Description
1. Current Account                   Includes Balance of Invisibles
2. Capital Account                    Includes Foreign Direct Investment
3. Current Account Deficit (CAD)     Exports exceed imports
4. Balance of Trade                   Difference between exports and imports of goods
5.  Capital Account Surplus           Net foreign investments exceed liabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The current account in the BoP includes the balance of trade (goods and services) and the balance of invisibles (transfers, income), making pair 1 correct.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a key component of the capital account, which records flows of capital, making pair 2 correct. A current account deficit (CAD) occurs when a country's payments for imports and other current account transactions exceed its receipts from exports and other sources, meaning imports exceed exports, thus making pair 3 incorrect.  The balance of trade is the difference between a country's total exports and total imports of goods (merchandise), making pair 4 correct. A capital account surplus occurs when a nation's net foreign investments surpass its foreign liabilities, making pair 5 correct. The question tests the understanding of the components of the Balance of Payments, requiring precise knowledge of the definitions of each component.  Only option (a) correctly identifies all the correctly matched pairs.



**5. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                 Description
1.  GDP Deflator                       Ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP
2.  Current Account Deficit (CAD)      Net outflow of funds from the country
3.  Fiscal Deficit                      Revenue exceeds expenditure
4.  Inflation Rate                     Increase in the general price level of goods and services
5.  Monetary Policy                    Government's policy on taxation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall price level in an economy, calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, making pair 1 correct. A current account deficit arises when a nation's imports exceed its exports, leading to a net outflow of funds,  making pair 2 correct. A fiscal deficit occurs when a government's expenditure surpasses its revenue, making pair 3 incorrect. The inflation rate measures the rate of increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy, making pair 4 correct. Monetary policy involves actions undertaken by a central bank to manipulate the money supply and credit conditions to stimulate or restrain economic activity, making pair 5 incorrect.  The question assesses the understanding of key economic indicators, demanding precise knowledge of their definitions and calculations, making it a challenging question. Only option (b) correctly identifies the three correctly matched pairs.




**6. With reference to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), consider the following pairs:**

    APEDA Function                     Description
1. Export Promotion                   Facilitates export of agricultural and processed food products

3.  GI Registration (Domestic)        Facilitates registration of Geographical Indications within India
4.  Market Research                   Conducts market research for agricultural products
5.  Quality Control                   Sets and enforces quality standards for exports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

APEDA's primary role is to promote the export of agricultural and processed food products, making pair 1 correct.  While APEDA plays a role in ensuring quality control, it doesn't directly regulate imports; this is primarily handled by other government agencies, making pair 2 incorrect.  APEDA facilitates GI registration for Indian products but this happens within India and not necessarily abroad, making pair 3 correct. APEDA conducts market research to identify export opportunities for Indian agricultural products, making pair 4 correct.  APEDA plays a vital role in ensuring the quality of exported products through various quality control measures, making pair 5 correct. The question tests knowledge of APEDA's functions, requiring a detailed understanding of its operations to differentiate between direct and indirect roles.  Only option (b) correctly identifies all the correctly matched pairs.


**7. With reference to  "zombie startups," consider the following pairs:**

    Characteristic                       Description
1.  Insufficient Funding               Lack of adequate capital during initial growth
2.  Unsustainable Business Model      Inability to generate profits or revenue
3.  Lack of Market Demand             Products/services not meeting market needs
4.  High Debt Levels                  Accumulation of significant debt burden
5.  Funding Winter                     Period of reduced venture capital investment

Insufficient funding is a hallmark of zombie startups, as they often struggle to secure adequate capital during their initial phases, making pair 1 correct.  Zombie startups often operate with unsustainable business models; they may struggle to generate profits or sufficient revenue to cover their expenses, making pair 2 correct.  A lack of market demand is a significant factor contributing to a startup's failure; their products or services may simply not appeal to consumers, making pair 3 correct.  High debt levels are another characteristic; these startups may accumulate significant debt, hindering their ability to operate sustainably, making pair 4 correct. A funding winter is a period where venture capital investments significantly decrease, making it difficult for startups to secure funding, leading to a higher likelihood of becoming a zombie startup, making pair 5 correct. The question assesses understanding of the characteristics of zombie startups, requiring a nuanced understanding of the various factors contributing to their existence.

The Finance Commission also recommends grants-in-aid to states to address imbalances in their fiscal capacity, making pair 2 correct.  The Finance Commission's role includes reviewing the financial position of states and providing advice on debt management, making pair 3 correct. The Finance Commission's recommendations are primarily focused on revenue distribution and grants, not on the overall fiscal policy of the central government, making pair 4 incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations influence resource allocation, it doesn't directly allocate funds to government departments; this is the role of the executive, making pair 5 incorrect. The question tests knowledge of the Finance Commission's role, requiring a clear understanding of its powers and limitations.

The CCO acts as an appellate authority in resolving disputes related to the declared grade of coal between consumers and owners, making pair 2 correct.  Coal allocation is primarily the function of other government bodies and not the CCO, making pair 3 incorrect. Coal pricing is determined through market mechanisms and government policies but not directly by the CCO, making pair 4 incorrect.  Import and export of coal are regulated by other government agencies, not the CCO, making pair 5 incorrect.  The question tests the specific functions of the CCO, requiring precise knowledge of its role within the coal sector governance.



**11. With reference to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), consider the following pairs:**

    SAT Jurisdiction                      Description

The SAT hears appeals against orders passed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), making pair 1 correct. The SAT also has jurisdiction over appeals against orders passed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), making pair 2 correct.  Similarly, the SAT hears appeals against orders from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), making pair 3 correct.  However, the SAT does not have jurisdiction over the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) orders; appeals against RBI orders go to different appellate bodies, making pair 4 incorrect.  The SAT's jurisdiction extends to the entire territory of India, making pair 5 correct. The question tests the understanding of the SAT's jurisdiction, demanding precise knowledge of the organizations whose orders are appealable to the SAT.


**12. With reference to Jute cultivation in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Jute Cultivation Characteristic         Description
1.  Seasonality                         Kharif crop

High temperatures, heavy rainfall, and high humidity are ideal climatic conditions for jute cultivation, making pair 3 correct. While India is a major producer and exporter of jute, it is not necessarily the largest exporter globally, making pair 4 incorrect. West Bengal is a major jute-producing state in India, making pair 5 correct. The question tests knowledge of jute cultivation characteristics in India, requiring detailed information to avoid incorrect assumptions about India's export dominance.


**13. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following pairs:**

5.  Export Market                       Primarily exported to European countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Araku coffee is cultivated in the hilly terrains of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, making pair 1 correct. Araku coffee received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag, although the exact year might vary slightly depending on the source, making pair 2 correct.

Araku coffee is largely produced using organic farming methods, minimizing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, making pair 4 correct.  While Araku coffee is exported, its primary market isn't solely restricted to European countries, making pair 5 incorrect. The question tests specific knowledge of Araku coffee, requiring detailed information about its production and characteristics.  Only option (c) correctly identifies all the correctly matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Regulatory Body                  Financial Institution/Policy
    1. SEBI                              :   Payment Banks
    2. RBI                               :   Goods and Services Tax (GST)
    3. Government of India              :   National Pension System (NPS)
    4. IRDAI                             :   Credit Information Companies (CICs)
    5.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)     :   Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because only pairs 3 and 5 represent accurate regulatory relationships.  The Government of India is the overarching body responsible for establishing and guiding the National Pension System (NPS) through legislation and policy directives.  Similarly, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulator for Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, overseeing their operations and compliance with banking regulations.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

* **Pair 1 (SEBI : Payment Banks):**  While SEBI regulates certain aspects of the financial markets, it does not directly regulate Payment Banks.  The RBI is the primary regulator for Payment Banks.

* **Pair 2 (RBI : Goods and Services Tax (GST)):** The RBI is not involved in the regulation of the GST. The GST is primarily governed by the GST Council, a constitutional body comprising representatives from both the central and state governments.

* **Pair 4 (IRDAI : Credit Information Companies (CICs)):** The IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) regulates the insurance sector, not Credit Information Companies (CICs). The RBI is the primary regulator for CICs.


Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 accurately reflect the regulatory relationships.  The other pairs contain incorrect or misleading associations, demonstrating a need for precise understanding of regulatory frameworks in India.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the regulatory landscape.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                          Function/Policy
    1.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :  Regulates Card Networks
    2.  APEDA                                   :  Manages the National Livestock Mission
    3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)           :  Administers the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
    4.  Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers : Oversees the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)
    5.  SEBI                                     :  Regulates Credit Rating Agencies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is the regulatory body responsible for overseeing and regulating Credit Rating Agencies in India.  These agencies assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and issuers of debt securities, a critical function within the capital markets that SEBI regulates.

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1 (NPCI : Regulates Card Networks):** The NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) develops and operates payment systems like UPI and RuPay, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulator of card networks in India.

* **Pair 2 (APEDA : Manages the National Livestock Mission):**  APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) focuses on export promotion of agricultural products. The National Livestock Mission is managed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying.

* **Pair 3 (RBI : Administers the Goods and Services Tax (GST)):** The RBI's role is primarily focused on monetary policy and regulation of financial institutions.  The GST is administered by the GST Council, a constitutional body.

* **Pair 4 (Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers : Oversees the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)):** The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) is published by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).


This question tests factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between the roles and responsibilities of different government organizations and regulatory bodies.  The question’s difficulty stems from the inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings, requiring careful consideration of each organization's mandate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                      Governing Body
    1.  Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007     :   IRDAI
    2.  Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 :   SEBI
    3.  National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021 :   RBI
    4.  Insurance Act 1938                           :   Ministry of Finance
    5.  Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority Act, 1985 :  APEDA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options (c) is correct. Pairs 2, 3, 4 and 5 show accurate pairings of acts/policies with their respective governing bodies. The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, is indeed governed by SEBI itself. The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, is overseen by the RBI. The Insurance Act, 1938, falls under the Ministry of Finance's purview, and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority Act, 1985, is managed by APEDA.

Pair 1 is incorrect because the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, is primarily governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India). The IRDAI regulates the insurance sector.

This question tests the candidate's ability to associate specific legislation with the appropriate regulatory or administrative authority in India's complex governance structure.  The presence of plausible distractors such as Pair 1, makes this a challenging question, requiring deep knowledge of Indian laws and their implementation.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Metric/Index                     Organization Responsible
    1.  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)        :   SEBI
    2.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)   :   RBI
    3.  Credit Deposit Ratio (CD Ratio)         :   Ministry of Finance
    4.  Current Account Deficit                  :   International Monetary Fund (IMF)
    5.  Balance of Payments                    :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Pairs 2, 4, and 5 accurately link the financial metric/index with the responsible organization. The RBI (Reserve Bank of India) publishes the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index). The IMF (International Monetary Fund) monitors and reports on Current Account Deficits globally.  The RBI also compiles and publishes data on the Balance of Payments for India.

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1 (LCR : SEBI):**  The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a banking regulatory metric primarily overseen by the RBI, not SEBI.

* **Pair 3 (CD Ratio : Ministry of Finance):** While the Ministry of Finance is involved in overall economic policy, the CD Ratio (Credit Deposit Ratio) is a banking sector metric primarily monitored by the RBI.


This question tests factual knowledge and understanding of the roles of different organizations in monitoring key financial indicators.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's understanding, making it a difficult question requiring precise knowledge.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                        Implementing/Governing Body
    1.  National Hydrogen Energy Mission     :   Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
    2.  Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles :  APEDA
    3.  Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) :  SEBI
    4.  National Translation Mission (NTM)  :  Ministry of Cooperation
    5.  National Pension System (NPS)         :  PFRDA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. Pairs 2, 4, and 5 accurately match the scheme/initiative with the implementing/governing body.  The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles is indeed implemented by APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority),  The National Translation Mission (NTM) is implemented under the Ministry of Culture, and the National Pension System (NPS) is regulated by PFRDA (Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority).

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1 (National Hydrogen Energy Mission : Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers):** The National Hydrogen Energy Mission is primarily overseen by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.

* **Pair 3 (RB-IOS : SEBI):** The Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) is implemented by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.


This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes and their respective administrative bodies.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options enhances the question's difficulty and tests the candidate's understanding of the Indian administrative and regulatory structure.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Act Section                                  Provision
1. Section 45L                                   :   Regulates All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs)
2. Section 47                                   :   Allocation of surplus profits
3. Section 11(1)                               :   Regulation of banking aspects of Cooperative Banks
4. Section 45N                                   :   Supervises NaBFID
5. Article 110                                  :  Deals with Money Bills

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Section 45L of the RBI Act, 1934, deals with the regulation and supervision of All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs), including NaBFID.  Section 47 of the RBI Act outlines the allocation of surplus profits, a crucial aspect of the RBI's relationship with the Union government. Section 45N of the RBI Act specifically addresses the regulation and supervision of NaBFID.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (b) is partially correct, but omits the correct pairing of Section 45L. Option (c) incorrectly includes Article 110, which is a part of the Indian Constitution, not the RBI Act. Option (d) is also incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of Section 45L and incorrectly includes Article 110.  The inclusion of Section 11(1) is a distractor, as it relates to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and not the RBI Act, 1934, although the RBI's role in regulating cooperative banks is well-established.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Monetary Policy Tool                     Primary Function
1. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)                   :   Absorbs liquidity from banks
2. Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (ICRR)      :   Manages surplus liquidity
3. Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)             :   Provides short-term loans to banks
4. Open Market Operations (OMO)              :   Adjusts repo and reverse repo rates
5. Ways and Means Advances (WMA)            :   Temporary loan facility for governments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The CRR is a tool used by the RBI to manage the overall liquidity in the banking system; it mandates that banks hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves with the RBI, thus affecting the amount available for lending. ICRR, while similar to CRR, specifically targets surplus liquidity by requiring banks to maintain additional reserves.  Ways and Means Advances are short-term loans provided by the RBI to the central and state governments to bridge temporary shortfalls in their cash balances. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the functions of at least one of the monetary policy tools. Option (a) incorrectly states that SDF provides short-term loans to banks; SDF is actually a tool for the RBI to absorb excess liquidity. Option (b) incorrectly states that OMO adjusts repo and reverse repo rates.  Option (d) incorrectly pairs CRR with the absorption of liquidity rather than the management of overall liquidity.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Payment System in India                       Governing Legislation
1. Unified Payments Interface (UPI)             :   Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007
2. Immediate Payment Service (IMPS)           :   Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
3. National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT)   :   Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934
4. Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)          :   Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The UPI and RTGS are both payment systems in India that fall under the purview of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. This act provides a comprehensive framework for regulating and supervising payment systems in the country.  IMPS is a system that doesn't have a dedicated act but operates within the existing legal framework concerning financial transactions. NEFT also operates under the existing legal and regulatory framework, not a specific act. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrect pairings and show a lack of understanding of the regulatory framework governing various payment systems. Option (b) incorrectly associates IMPS and NEFT with specific acts. Option (c) incorrectly pairs NEFT with the RBI Act, while the RBI Act is the overarching legal framework, it's not the primary legislation governing NEFT's operation.  Option (d) incorrectly suggests that the RBI Act, 1934, governs NEFT, overlooking the PSS Act, 2007.


**4. With reference to the regulation of cooperative banks in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulatory Body                                  Area of Regulation
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                   :   Management-related aspects (Incorporation, registration)
2. Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS)     :   Banking aspects (Capital adequacy, risk control)
3. State Government                               :   Supervises the functioning of PACS

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

State Governments, through their respective Registrars of Cooperative Societies, are responsible for the regulation of management-related aspects of cooperative banks, including incorporation, registration, and other managerial functions. The RBI primarily regulates the banking aspects of cooperative banks, such as capital adequacy, risk control, and lending norms.  PACS (Primary Agricultural Credit Societies) operate outside the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are not regulated by the RBI; they fall under the purview of the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they misrepresent the roles of the RBI and RCS in regulating cooperative banks. Option (a) incorrectly assigns management-related aspects to the RBI, while Option (b) incorrectly assigns banking aspects to RCS.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Insurance Scheme/Concept                       Key Feature
1. Health Protection Gap (HPG)                 :   Measures the difference between optimal and actual insurance coverage
2. Mortality Protection Gap (MPG)              :   Focuses on the adequacy of health insurance coverage
3. Insurance Penetration                         :   Ratio of premiums collected to the country's population
4. Insurance Density                            :   Percentage of total premiums collected to the country's GDP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Health Protection Gap (HPG) accurately reflects the difference between the ideal level of health insurance coverage needed to meet healthcare costs and the actual level of coverage available.  The Mortality Protection Gap (MPG), however, focuses on the financial security of a family in the event of the sudden death of a wage earner, not specifically health insurance. Insurance penetration measures the ratio of total premiums collected to a country's GDP, not the population. Insurance density is the ratio of premiums to the population. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misinterpret the definitions of at least one of the insurance concepts.  Option (b) incorrectly defines MPG as focusing on health insurance adequacy. Option (c) incorrectly defines insurance penetration and density.


**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s role in regulating financial entities, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Entity                                     Regulatory Function of RBI
1. Commercial Banks                                 :   Supervises and regulates under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007
2. Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)        :   Sets PSL targets
3. Credit Information Companies (CICs)              :   Regulates under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
4. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)                     :   Regulates under the PSS Act, 2007

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The RBI's regulatory oversight of commercial banks extends to payment systems, as mandated by the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. The RBI also regulates RRBs, although the specific act governing this might not be explicitly mentioned in this text.  NBFCs are not directly subject to PSL targets set by the RBI; banks are the primary entities with PSL targets. CICs are regulated by the RBI, but not under the Banking Regulation Act.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one incorrect pairing. Option (b) incorrectly states that the RBI sets PSL targets for NBFCs and that CICs are regulated under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Option (c) contains the same errors as (b) and adds an incorrect association of commercial banks with the PSS Act. Option (d) only correctly identifies the RBI's regulatory role concerning RRBs but omits the crucial connection between the RBI and commercial banks regarding payment systems.


**7. With reference to the  National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of NaBFID                                 Specific Detail
1. Establishment                                   :   2021 by an Act of Parliament
2. Regulatory Body                               :   Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
3. Primary Objective                              :   Addressing gaps in short-term finance for infrastructure
4. Shareholding                                  :   Entirely held by the Central Government
5. Head Office Location                           :   New Delhi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

NaBFID was established in 2021 through an Act of Parliament, making pair 1 correct. The entire shareholding of NaBFID is currently held by the Government of India, making pair 4 correct.  NaBFID is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. NaBFID's primary objective is to address gaps in *long-term* non-recourse finance for infrastructure, not short-term finance.  Its head office is in Mumbai, not New Delhi. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair. Option (b) incorrectly identifies SEBI as the regulatory body and New Delhi as the head office location. Option (c) incorrectly defines NaBFID's primary objective. Option (d) incorrectly defines NaBFID's primary objective.


**8.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Primary Function
1.  National Insurance Academy (NIA)             :   Regulates the insurance sector in India
2.  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) :   Research and development in insurance
3.  Spices Board India                           :   Serves as the Secretariat for the Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH)
4.  Food Corporation of India (FCI)              :   Manages grain storage facilities across India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The IRDAI is the statutory body responsible for regulating, promoting, and ensuring the orderly growth of the insurance business and reinsurance business in India. The Spices Board India serves as the Secretariat for the CCSCH, supporting its activities in developing international standards for spices. The FCI is the primary government agency responsible for the procurement, storage, and distribution of food grains in India.  The NIA’s main function is research and training in insurance and related areas, not regulation. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they misrepresent the functions of at least one organization. Option (a) incorrectly assigns the function of regulating the insurance sector to NIA. Option (b) incorrectly assigns the function of regulating the insurance sector to NIA. Option (c) incorrectly assigns regulation of the insurance sector to NIA.


**9. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of RB-IOS                                 Detail
1. Year of Launch                               :   2018
2. Integrated Schemes                           :   Banking Ombudsman Scheme, Ombudsman Scheme for NBFCs, Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions
3. Primary Objective                             :   Cost-free redressal of complaints against entities regulated by SEBI
4. Handling of Complaints                        :   Primarily through physical channels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The RB-IOS integrated the existing three Ombudsman schemes of the RBI: Banking Ombudsman Scheme, Ombudsman Scheme for Non-Banking Financial Companies, and Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions. The RB-IOS was launched in 2021, not 2018. Its primary objective is to provide cost-free redressal of complaints against entities regulated by the RBI, not SEBI.  The majority of complaints are handled through digital modes, not primarily through physical channels. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one mismatched pair.  Option (a) incorrectly states the launch year.  Option (c) incorrectly states the objective and the regulatory body involved. Option (d) incorrectly states the primary mode of complaint handling.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Metric                                      Definition/Application
1.  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)                  :   Measures a bank's ability to meet long-term liquidity needs
2.  Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)                  :   Share of NDTL that banks must maintain with RBI as liquid assets
3.  Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL)           :   Total assets of a bank minus its liabilities
4.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)                   :   Measures a bank’s ability to absorb losses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The LCR measures a bank's ability to meet short-term liquidity needs during a crisis, not long-term needs.  The SLR correctly defines the share of NDTL that banks must maintain with the RBI as liquid assets.  NDTL is the difference between a bank's demand and time liabilities and its assets held by other banks, not total assets minus liabilities. CAR accurately measures a bank's ability to absorb losses. Option (a) is incorrect as it incorrectly defines LCR. Option (b) is incorrect because it misrepresents the definition of NDTL. Option (c) contains the errors from option (b) and adds an incorrect definition of LCR.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Body          Mandate/Function
    1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) : Conducts examinations for recruitment to All India Services
    2. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) : Advises the President on matters related to the welfare of Scheduled Castes
    3. State Finance Commission       :  Reviews the financial position of Municipalities and makes recommendations for improving their financial position
    4. Appointments Committee of the Union Cabinet : Advises the President on appointments to the UPSC

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC's primary function, as enshrined in the Constitution of India (Articles 315-323), is to conduct examinations for recruitment to various civil services, including the All India Services.  This is a core and well-established function.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Constitution. Its mandate includes advising the President on matters related to the welfare and safeguards of Scheduled Castes.  This is a direct function outlined in the constitutional provision.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While State Finance Commissions do review the financial position of local bodies, their primary focus, as per constitutional provisions, is on Panchayats (Part IX, Article 243I).  They may offer recommendations on municipalities, but it's not their central mandate as defined by the Constitution.

Statement 4 is correct. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) plays a crucial role in advising the President on appointments to various high-level positions within the government, including members of the UPSC. This is a well-established process within the Indian governmental framework.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legislative Body              Power/Responsibility
    1. Lok Sabha                   :  Exclusive power to introduce Money Bills
    2. Rajya Sabha                  :  Power to amend Money Bills
    3. State Legislative Assembly  :  Power to pass resolutions disapproving ordinances
    4. Parliament                  :  Power to amend the Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 110 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the Lok Sabha the exclusive power to initiate Money Bills.  The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations, but cannot amend or reject a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to amend Money Bills.  Its role is limited to recommending amendments, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject.

Statement 3 is correct.  Articles 123 (for Presidential Ordinances) and 213 (for Governor's Ordinances) stipulate that a State Legislative Assembly (and the Council, if applicable) can pass a resolution disapproving an ordinance.  This leads to the ordinance lapsing.

Statement 4 is correct.  Article 368 of the Constitution outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution, a power vested in the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha).

Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article      Subject Matter
    1. Article 155                   :  Appointment of the Governor
    2. Article 361                   :  Immunity from criminal prosecution for the President and Governor
    3. Article 21A                  :  Right to Education
    4. Article 110                   :  Definition of a Money Bill


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 155 of the Constitution deals with the appointment of the Governor of a state by the President.  This is a direct and clearly defined constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 361 grants immunity from criminal prosecution to the President and the Governor. This is a crucial aspect of their constitutional protection.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 21A, inserted by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, guarantees the right to free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14 years.

Statement 4 is correct. Article 110 of the Constitution defines what constitutes a Money Bill. This is a fundamental aspect of the legislative process related to finance.

Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment                Key Provision/Impact
    1. 42nd Constitutional Amendment : Shifted Education from State List to Concurrent List
    2. 68th Constitutional Amendment : Introduced Article 21A (Right to Education)
    3. 44th Constitutional Amendment : Incorporated provisions related to Tribunals (Articles 323A and 323B)
    4. Right to Education Act, 2009: Aims to provide free and compulsory education to children between 6 and 14 years of age


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 shifted the subject of 'education' from the State List to the Concurrent List, allowing both the Centre and the States to legislate on education. The 68th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002 inserted Article 21A into the Constitution, guaranteeing the right to education.  The 44th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1978 introduced Articles 323A and 323B, which deal with the establishment of administrative tribunals. Finally, the Right to Education Act, 2009, aims to provide free and compulsory education to children aged 6 to 14 years, as mandated by Article 21A.  Therefore, all four pairs are accurate.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legislative Procedure       House/Body Involved
    1. Introduction of Money Bill : Lok Sabha
    2.  Final Decision on Money Bill : Speaker of Lok Sabha
    3.  Restricted Powers on Money Bills : Rajya Sabha
    4.  Presidential Assent to Money Bills: President of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Only the Lok Sabha can introduce a Money Bill.

Statement 2 is correct. If any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is final.  This is a crucial aspect of the legislative process concerning Money Bills.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Rajya Sabha has very limited powers regarding Money Bills; it can only delay the Bill for a maximum of 14 days. It cannot amend or reject a Money Bill.

Statement 4 is correct. The President's assent is required for a Money Bill to become law. The President can only give assent, withhold assent or return the bill for reconsideration. However, the President cannot return a Money Bill for reconsideration.

Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Organization                                   Associated Entity/Feature
1. Right to Information Act, 2005                  :   Department of Personnel and Training
2. Central Information Commission (CIC)             :   Constitutional body
3.  President of India                              :   Appoints Chief Information Commissioner
4.  Information Commissioners                     :   Tenure of five years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Right to Information Act, 2005, is indeed managed by the Department of Personnel and Training, making pair 1 correct.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is a statutory body, not a constitutional body, established under the RTI Act, 2005. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. The President of India appoints the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners based on the recommendation of a committee, making pair 3 correct.  Finally, the tenure of Information Commissioners is three years, not five, rendering pair 4 incorrect. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Understanding the distinction between statutory and constitutional bodies is crucial for UPSC aspirants. The administrative oversight of the RTI Act by the Department of Personnel and Training highlights the government's role in ensuring transparency and accountability. The President's role in appointing the CIC underscores the importance of executive oversight in the functioning of independent regulatory bodies.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article/Act                        Subject Matter
1. Article 110                                      :   Definition of Financial Bills
2. Article 341                                      :   Specification of Scheduled Tribes
3.  Article 361                                     :   Immunities of Governors and the President
4.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act                        :   Establishment of courts in urban areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 110 of the Constitution deals with the definition of Money Bills, a crucial aspect of financial legislation.  Therefore, while the statement mentions "Financial Bills," the core concept of defining money bills is accurate, making pair 1 correct. Article 341 deals with the specification of Scheduled Castes, not Scheduled Tribes; that's covered under Article 342. Thus, pair 2 is incorrect. Article 361 correctly outlines the immunities granted to the President and Governors, making pair 3 correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, focuses on establishing inexpensive courts in rural areas to provide easy access to justice at the grassroots level.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect. Consequently, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  A comprehensive understanding of constitutional provisions relating to finance, social justice, and the judiciary is essential for UPSC preparation. The accurate pairing of Article 110 and the definition of Money Bills highlights the importance of understanding the legislative process concerning financial matters. Similarly, the correct matching of Article 361 and the immunities of the President and Governors showcases the significance of understanding the balance of power within the Indian political system.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Act                                         Key Feature/Responsibility
1. NITI Aayog                                        :   Replaced the Planning Commission
2. Foreigners Tribunals (FTs)                       :   Established under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019
3.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)        :   Headed by a Chairman and 10 members
4.  Article 200                                      :   Governor's power to amend bills


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NITI Aayog was indeed formed to replace the Planning Commission, making pair 1 correct.  Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) were established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, not the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019; the CAA deals with the grant of citizenship, whereas FTs handle cases related to suspected foreign nationals. Thus, pair 2 is incorrect. The UPSC is headed by a Chairman and can have up to 10 members, making pair 3 correct.  Article 200 deals with the Governor's power to give assent, withhold assent, return the bill for reconsideration, or reserve it for the President. The governor cannot amend a bill. Thus, pair 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Knowledge of India's administrative and constitutional structures is crucial for UPSC success.  The accurate pairing of NITI Aayog with its replacement of the Planning Commission showcases the understanding of policy-making evolution. Similarly, the correct matching of UPSC with its composition demonstrates an understanding of the functioning of the constitutional body responsible for recruitment to civil services.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Act                                    Power/Function
1. The President of India                           :   Grants immunity under Article 361
2.  Bombay High Court                              :   Can overrule state government decisions on RTE quotas
3.  Foreigners Tribunals (FTs)                       :   Final authority on citizenship matters
4.  Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT)            :   Final authority on transfer pricing disputes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The President of India does indeed enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution during their term of office as per Article 361, making pair 1 correct. The Bombay High Court overturned a Maharashtra government exemption for private schools from RTE quota admissions, demonstrating its power to overrule state government decisions on this matter. This makes pair 2 correct.  Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) determine whether an individual is a foreigner, not their citizenship status. The final say on citizenship lies with the government and courts after the FT's decision. Thus, pair 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court clarified that the ITAT's decision on transfer pricing is not final if the arm's length price (ALP) is determined outside the purview of relevant transfer pricing provisions, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The question tests the understanding of the judicial review power, the role of the High Courts in interpreting laws, and the limits of quasi-judicial bodies.  The correct matching of Article 361 with the President's immunity demonstrates the knowledge of constitutional safeguards.  The correct matching of the Bombay High Court with the power to overrule state government decisions highlights the importance of judicial review in upholding the rule of law and protecting rights.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Organization                                 Associated Entity/Function
1. Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023:   Decriminalizes provisions across 42 laws
2.  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)                :   Established under the BIS Act, 1986
3.  The International Competition Network (ICN)    :   Informal network of competition authorities
4.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)      :   Appointed by the Prime Minister


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Vishwas Act of 2023 successfully decriminalized numerous provisions across various laws, making pair 1 correct. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) was established under the BIS Act, 1986, making pair 2 correct. The International Competition Network (ICN) is indeed an informal network of competition authorities worldwide, making pair 3 correct.  The CAG is appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister, thus making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests the understanding of recent legislative reforms, the role of standardization bodies, and international cooperation in competition policy.  The correct matching of the Jan Vishwas Act highlights the government's efforts toward ease of doing business. The accurate pairing of BIS with its establishment Act shows the understanding of India's quality control mechanisms.  The correct identification of ICN as an informal network demonstrates the knowledge of international cooperation in competition law.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, primarily focusing on factual recall and analysis with plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Subject Matter
1. Article 110                      :   Definition of a Financial Bill
2. Article 111                      :   President's assent to Bills
3. Article 323A                    :   Establishment of Lok Adalats
4. Article 39A                     :   Provisions for free legal aid

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 110 of the Indian Constitution defines a Money Bill, a crucial aspect of financial legislation.  Article 111 outlines the President's power regarding the assent to Bills passed by Parliament, including Money Bills. Article 39A, inserted by the 42nd Amendment, mandates the state to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on the basis of equal opportunity and provides free legal aid.  Option (a) is incorrect because it omits Article 39A. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly paired Article 323A; Article 323A deals with the establishment of administrative tribunals, not Lok Adalats.  Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs Article 323A with the establishment of Lok Adalats. Lok Adalats are established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, not a specific constitutional article.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                Power related to Money Bills
1. Rajya Sabha                     :   Can amend a Money Bill
2. Lok Sabha                       :   Introduces a Money Bill
3. Council of Ministers             :   Can reject a Money Bill
4. State Legislature                :   Can introduce a Money Bill

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Lok Sabha holds the primary power to introduce Money Bills.  The Rajya Sabha cannot amend a Money Bill; it can only recommend amendments within 14 days. The Council of Ministers cannot reject a Money Bill; they can only advise the President. State Legislatures do not have the power to introduce Money Bills; this power rests solely with the Lok Sabha.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (b) incorrectly attributes the power to introduce Money Bills to state legislatures. Option (c) incorrectly states that the Rajya Sabha can amend Money Bills. Option (d) incorrectly includes the Council of Ministers and State Legislature as having powers over the Money Bill they don't possess.


**3. With reference to the appointment of Governors, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article        Power/Function
1. Article 155                     :   Removal of Governors
2. Article 161                     :   Power to grant pardons
3. Article 163                     :   Council of Ministers advises the Governor
4. Article 176                     :   Governor's address to the Legislature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 161 grants the Governor the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, remissions, and commutations of sentences. Article 163 establishes that the Council of Ministers aids and advises the Governor in the exercise of their functions, except where they are required to exercise discretionary powers.  Article 176 mandates the Governor to deliver a special address to the Legislature.  Option (a) is incorrect because it omits Article 176. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly links Article 155 with the removal of Governors; Article 155 deals with the *appointment* of Governors, not their removal.  Option (d) is incorrect because it falsely connects Article 155 with the removal of Governors. The removal of a Governor is not explicitly detailed in the constitution but is at the pleasure of the President.


**4. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Provision                  Feature/Characteristic
1. Article 39A                     :   Establishes Lok Adalats
2. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 :   Provides statutory status to Lok Adalats
3. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908    :   Lok Adalats are bound by its procedures


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, provides the statutory basis for Lok Adalats, granting them legal recognition and defining their operational framework. Article 39A deals with the state's obligation to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice and provides free legal aid.  Lok Adalats are not bound by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as they operate under their own distinct legal framework.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or omit the correct pairing of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, with the statutory status of Lok Adalats.


**5. With reference to the Law Commission of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic                     Description
1. Statutory Body                   :   Constituted by the Government of India
2. Functions under Ministry of Law and Justice :   Recommends reforms in existing laws
3. Reconstituted every five years    :   Non-statutory body


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Law Commission of India functions under the Ministry of Law and Justice and its primary role is recommending reforms in existing laws.  The Law Commission is a non-statutory body, meaning it's not established by an act of Parliament; it's constituted by the Government of India from time to time. It is reconstituted every three years, not five. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs, specifically regarding the statutory status of the Law Commission and its reconstitution frequency.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body             Specific Function
1. Rajya Sabha                   :   Certifies a Money Bill
2. Lok Sabha                     :   Passes a Money Bill
3. President                     :   Can return a Money Bill for reconsideration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the Lok Sabha has the power to pass a Money Bill.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha, certifies a Money Bill. The President cannot return a Money Bill for reconsideration; they can only give or withhold assent. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, misrepresenting the roles of the Rajya Sabha and the President concerning Money Bills.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bill                  Power of the President
1. Money Bill                     :   Can amend the Bill
2. Ordinary Bill                  :   Can withhold assent
3. Constitutional Amendment Bill :   Can return the Bill for reconsideration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The President possesses the power to withhold assent to an ordinary bill, effectively preventing it from becoming law.  The president also has the power to return an ordinary bill for reconsideration.  The President cannot amend any bill; this power rests with Parliament. The President can only give or withhold assent to a Money Bill. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the President's powers concerning Money Bills and Constitutional Amendment Bills.  The President's power over a constitutional amendment bill is limited to only giving assent.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Alternative Dispute Redressal Mechanism       Key Feature
1. Lok Adalat                                    :   Deals with non-compoundable criminal cases
2. Tribunal System                               :   Introduced by the 42nd Amendment
3. National Green Tribunal                       :   Constitutional body


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The incorporation of tribunals into the Indian legal system is traced back to the 42nd Amendment. Lok Adalats do *not* deal with non-compoundable criminal cases; they handle civil and compoundable criminal matters. The National Green Tribunal is a statutory body, established by an Act of Parliament, not a constitutional body. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs, misrepresenting the features of Lok Adalats and the National Green Tribunal.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governor's Action on a Bill                 Outcome
1. Give assent                               :   Bill becomes law
2. Withhold assent                          :   Bill fails to become law
3. Return for reconsideration (passed again):  Governor must give assent


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  If the Governor gives assent to a bill, it becomes law. If the Governor withholds assent, the bill fails. If the legislature passes the bill again after the Governor returns it for reconsideration, the Governor is constitutionally obligated to give assent to the re-enacted bill.  There are no incorrect matchings in this set of pairs.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                  Provision Related To
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 :   Urban Local Bodies
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 :   Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987     :   Lok Adalats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, is directly related to the establishment and functioning of Lok Adalats. The 73rd Amendment Act constitutionalized Panchayati Raj Institutions. The 74th Amendment Act constitutionalized Urban Local Bodies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the relationship between the Acts/Amendments and their respective subjects.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                     Originating Glacier
1. Ganges River             :   Gangotri Glacier
2. Yamuna River             :   Yamunotri Glacier
3. Indus River               :   Siachen Glacier
4. Brahmaputra River       :   Chemayungdung Glacier
5. Sutlej River              :   Rakshastal Lake

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ganges River originates from the Gangotri Glacier in the Himalayas.  The Yamuna River originates from the Yamunotri Glacier, also in the Himalayas.  The Brahmaputra River's origin is near the Chemayungdung Glacier in the Himalayas. The Indus River originates from the glaciers of the Kailash range and not Siachen glacier.  The Sutlej River originates from Rakshastal Lake in Tibet. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs involving the Indus and Sutlej rivers. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings based on established geographical knowledge. The question tests factual recall of river origins, highlighting the importance of precise geographical knowledge in UPSC examinations.  Distractors like Siachen Glacier for Indus and other incorrect pairings are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar sounding or geographically proximate locations.


**2. With reference to major rivers of India, consider the following pairs:**

   River                      Major Tributary
1. Ganges River             :   Godavari River
2. Brahmaputra River       :   Teesta River
3. Indus River               :   Chenab River
4. Narmada River            :   Tapti River
5. Krishna River             :   Tungabhadra River

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Chenab River is a major tributary of the Indus River. The Tapti River is a major tributary of the Narmada River. The Tungabhadra River is a major tributary of the Krishna River.  The Godavari River is not a tributary of the Ganges, and it is a major independent river system draining into the Bay of Bengal. Similarly, the Teesta River is a tributary of the Brahmaputra, but the pairing in the question is designed as a distractor.  Option (d) accurately identifies the three correctly matched pairs (3, 4, and 5). The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair, testing the candidate's knowledge of major Indian river systems and their tributaries.  The question emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of river systems and the ability to discern correct information from plausible distractors, a key skill assessed in the UPSC exam.


**3. With reference to the Arabian Sea, consider the following pairs:**

   River                       Characteristic
1. Indus River               :   Flows into the Arabian Sea
2. Narmada River            :   West-flowing peninsular river
3. Tapi River                 :   Drains into the Bay of Bengal
4. Mahi River                :   Drains into the Arabian Sea
5. Sabarmati River           :   Drains into the Arabian Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indus River flows into the Arabian Sea. The Narmada and Mahi rivers are west-flowing peninsular rivers that drain into the Arabian Sea. The Sabarmati River also drains into the Arabian Sea. The Tapi River, however, drains into the Arabian Sea and not the Bay of Bengal as stated in option 3.  Option (b) correctly identifies all the pairs that are factually accurate.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs, showcasing the need for precise knowledge of river systems and their drainage patterns. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify accurate information amidst distractors, crucial for success in the UPSC exam.  The inclusion of the Tapi River with an incorrect drainage pattern serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's detailed understanding.


**4. With reference to UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Site                          Category
1. Kaziranga National Park     :   Natural Heritage
2. Sundarbans National Park    :   Mixed Heritage
3. Mahabodhi Temple Complex  :   Cultural Heritage
4.  Khangchendzonga National Park :  Natural Heritage
5.  Rani ki Vav                 :  Cultural Heritage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Kaziranga National Park is a Natural Heritage site recognized for its one-horned rhinoceros population. The Mahabodhi Temple Complex is a Cultural Heritage site significant for its Buddhist connections. Khangchendzonga National Park is a Natural Heritage site, notable for its high-altitude biodiversity. Rani ki Vav is a Cultural Heritage site, a remarkable stepwell.  The Sundarbans National Park is a Mixed Heritage Site, encompassing both natural and cultural values.  Option (c) accurately identifies all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either miss correctly matched pairs or include incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's knowledge of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India and their classifications. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring candidates to accurately categorize these sites, which is important for understanding India's cultural and natural heritage within a global context, a theme frequently explored in UPSC examinations. The inclusion of the Sundarbans with an incorrect category is a significant distractor.


**5. With reference to the Disaster Management Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Disaster Type                Classification
1. Flood                        :   Notified Disaster
2. Earthquake                   :   Notified Disaster
3. Cyclone                      :   Notified Disaster
4. Heatwave                    :   Notified Disaster
5. Landslide                    :   Not a Notified Disaster


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Floods, earthquakes, and cyclones are all explicitly categorized as notified disasters under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, making them eligible for financial assistance.  The Union government has also recently classified heatwaves as a notified disaster. However, while landslides are certainly a significant disaster, they are not always automatically classified as 'notified disasters' under the Act;  the classification may depend on the scale and impact of the specific event. Option (b) accurately represents the disasters officially categorized as notified disasters. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude heatwaves or incorrectly include landslides. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of disaster management policies in India, a crucial aspect of governance and administration frequently examined in the UPSC exam.  The inclusion of landslides as a potential distractor tests the candidate’s detailed comprehension of the Act's provisions.  This question effectively tests factual recall and application of knowledge.


**6. With reference to the countries bordering the Arabian Sea, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Coastal Characteristic
1. India                       :   Longest coastline on the Arabian Sea
2. Pakistan                    :   Significant Indus River delta
3. Oman                        :   Major oil exporting country
4. Yemen                       :   Located on the southern coast
5. Somalia                     :   Located on the eastern coast


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India possesses the longest coastline along the Arabian Sea. Pakistan has a significant Indus River delta on its Arabian Sea coast. Yemen is situated on the southern coast of the Arabian Sea. Somalia borders the Arabian Sea on its eastern coastline. Oman is indeed a major oil-exporting country, but this fact is unrelated to its coastal characteristics on the Arabian Sea.  Option (b) correctly identifies all the pairs with accurate coastal characteristics. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the irrelevant pairing of Oman's oil exports or misrepresent the geographical location of a country.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring candidates to link countries with their specific coastal features on the Arabian Sea, demonstrating an understanding of regional geography, which is often tested in the UPSC exam. The inclusion of Oman as a distractor tests the candidate's ability to filter out irrelevant information.


**7. With reference to the countries sharing borders with Ivory Coast, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Type of Border
1. Liberia                     :   Land Border
2. Guinea                      :   Land Border
3. Burkina Faso               :   Maritime Border
4. Ghana                       :   Land Border
5. Mali                        :   Land Border

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Liberia, Guinea, and Ghana share land borders with Ivory Coast. Burkina Faso does not share a land border with Ivory Coast; therefore, the statement that it has a maritime border is incorrect. Mali also does not share a border with Ivory Coast.  Option (a) accurately reflects the countries with land borders. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs, testing the candidate's knowledge of West African geography and the ability to differentiate between land and maritime borders. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills, demanding precise geographical knowledge of West Africa, a region frequently featured in UPSC examinations.  The inclusion of Burkina Faso and Mali with incorrect border types serves as effective distractors.


**8. With reference to the 'Lithium Triangle', consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Resource
1. Argentina                   :   Lithium Reserves
2. Bolivia                     :   Lithium Reserves
3. Chile                       :   Lithium Reserves
4. Brazil                      :   Iron Ore Reserves
5. Paraguay                    :   Hydropower Resources

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile form the "Lithium Triangle," a region known for its significant lithium reserves.  Brazil is known for its iron ore reserves, and Paraguay for its hydropower resources, but these are not part of the Lithium Triangle.  Option (a) correctly identifies the three countries constituting the Lithium Triangle. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit one or more of the core countries or include countries not associated with the Lithium Triangle, testing the candidate's knowledge of this specific geographical region and its resources.  The question assesses factual recall and conceptual understanding of the "Lithium Triangle," a topic relevant to global resource distribution and geopolitical dynamics, often discussed in UPSC examinations.  The inclusion of Brazil and Paraguay as distractors increases the question's difficulty level.


**9. With reference to the countries sharing borders with Rwanda, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Border Type
1. Uganda                      :    Land Border
2. Ethiopia                    :    Land Border
3. Burundi                     :    Land Border
4. Tanzania                    :    Land Border
5. Zambia                      :    Maritime Border

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania share land borders with Rwanda.  Ethiopia and Zambia do not share land borders with Rwanda; Zambia, in fact, has no border with Rwanda at all. Option (a) accurately identifies the countries with land borders. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs, testing the candidate's knowledge of East African geography and their ability to identify correct border types. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills, requiring precise geographical knowledge of the East African region, a frequently tested area in UPSC examinations. The inclusion of Ethiopia and Zambia with incorrect border types serves as a strong distractor.


**10. With reference to the countries sharing borders with Liberia, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Border Type
1. Guinea                      :   Land Border
2. Mauritania                 :   Land Border
3. Burkina Faso               :   Land Border
4. Sierra Leone               :   Land Border
5. Senegal                     :   Maritime Border

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Guinea and Sierra Leone share land borders with Liberia. Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and Senegal do not share land borders with Liberia; Senegal, in particular, is separated by a significant distance and has a maritime border with the Atlantic Ocean.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Brahmaputra River's origin is not precisely Mount Kailash, although its headwaters are in the Tibetan Plateau near Mount Kailash.  The river originates from several glacial sources in the Himalayas, including the Angsi Glacier in the Kailash Range near Mansarovar Lake.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Siang River, an upper stretch of the Brahmaputra, does indeed originate near the Angsi Glacier in the Kailash Range, making statement 2 correct.  The Yarlung Tsangpo River is another name for the Brahmaputra River in Tibet, flowing through the Tibet Autonomous Region, thus statement 3 is also correct. The question tests the ability to distinguish between precise origins and broader geographical contexts.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they present only partially accurate information. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate statement regarding the Brahmaputra's origin.  Understanding the nuanced geography of transboundary rivers is crucial for UPSC preparation, particularly given the geopolitical implications of water resources.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Brahmaputra River flows through Arunachal Pradesh, making statement 1 correct.  The Siang River is the name for the Brahmaputra River in Arunachal Pradesh; it becomes the Brahmaputra in Assam. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect as the Siang River itself doesn't flow through Assam. The Lohit River, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra, also flows through Arunachal Pradesh, so statement 3 is correct. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the geographical course of major rivers in Northeast India. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include only partially correct information or entirely incorrect statements about the river's flow.  Knowledge of the geographical features of the Northeast, including river systems, is essential for UPSC aspirants, especially in the context of border issues and infrastructure development.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided factual data, designed to be challenging and incorporate various cognitive skills.  Remember, the questions themselves contain all the necessary information; no external knowledge is required.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country           |  Governmental Feature
    -------------------|-----------------------
    1. Argentina       |  Parliamentary system
    2. Bolivia         |  Presidential system
    3. Chile           |  Unitary state
    4. India           |  Federal republic


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bolivia and Chile are correctly matched. Bolivia has a presidential system of government, and Chile operates under a unitary state structure. India is a federal republic, meaning power is shared between a central government and constituent states.  Argentina, however, has a presidential system, not a parliamentary one as suggested in option 1.  A parliamentary system features a head of state (often a monarch or president) and a head of government (prime minister) who is responsible to the parliament.  Argentina's government is headed by a president who is both head of state and head of government.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the mismatched pair of Argentina and its governmental system. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to differentiate between various forms of government.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bolivia is known for its significant tin reserves, and Chile is a major producer of copper.  Argentina's major resource is lithium, not bauxite, which is more associated with countries like Australia and Guinea. India is a significant producer of manganese, but the question tests the candidate's knowledge of the primary resources of other countries. The inclusion of India as a distractor highlights the need for precise factual recall.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar resources.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country       |  Geographical Feature
    ---------------|-----------------------
    1. Argentina    |  Pampas
    2. Bolivia       |  Altiplano
    3. Chile        |  Atacama Desert
    4. India         |  Deccan Plateau


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Pampas are the fertile plains of Argentina, the Altiplano is the high plateau region of Bolivia, and the Atacama Desert is located in Chile.  The Deccan Plateau is a prominent geographical feature of India. This question tests factual recall of geographical features associated with specific countries.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes the question challenging, demanding accurate knowledge. Incorrect options would lack at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of geographical regions.

    2. Bolivia       |  Peru
    3. Chile         |  Bolivia
    4. India         |  Argentina


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched regarding bilateral agreements?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile share borders and have various regional agreements, the question focuses on bilateral agreements specifically mentioned in the data.  Only the India-Argentina agreement is explicitly mentioned.  The other options include pairs that are geographically plausible but lack specific evidence of a named bilateral agreement.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they assume the existence of bilateral agreements not explicitly mentioned in the available information. This question tests the ability to evaluate information and correctly identify the specific bilateral agreements.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Name                |  Nodal Ministry

    1. PMKKKY                     |  Ministry of Mines
    2. Smart Cities Mission      |  Ministry of Rural Development
    3. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana | Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
    4. Digital Bharat Nidhi       |  Ministry of Communications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PMKKKY (Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana) is correctly paired with the Ministry of Mines.  Digital Bharat Nidhi falls under the Ministry of Communications. The Smart Cities Mission is under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, not the Ministry of Rural Development, and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana is under the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the organizational structure of Indian government schemes.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pairs involving the Smart Cities Mission and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to match government schemes with their respective ministries.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    State                      |  Significant Initiative/Policy
    ---------------------------|-----------------------------
    1. Uttarakhand              |  Uniform Civil Code
    2. Himachal Pradesh         |  Organic farming
    3. Gujarat                   |  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance
    4. Kerala                    |  Passive Euthanasia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched based on the provided data. Uttarakhand is associated with the Uniform Civil Code initiative. Himachal Pradesh is known for its focus on organic farming. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance is inaugurated in Gujarat. Kerala has allowed Passive Euthanasia.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of recent state-level initiatives and policies.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes the question demanding, requiring precise and thorough knowledge. Incorrect options would be missing at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests factual recall and application of knowledge to different states.


**7. With reference to the Disaster Management Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

    Disaster Category      |  Eligibility for Financial Assistance
    -----------------------|---------------------------------
    1. Heatwaves             |  Eligible under the Act
    2. Cyclones              |  Eligible under the Act
    3. Droughts               |  Eligible under the Act
    4. Landslides             |  Eligible under the Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Cyclones, droughts, and landslides are explicitly mentioned in the provided text as categories of disasters eligible for financial assistance under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.  However, the text states that there is no plan to classify heatwaves as a notified disaster, thus making option 1 incorrect.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair of heatwaves and financial assistance. The question tests the candidate's ability to analyze information presented and draw conclusions based on the given facts.  This tests factual recall and analytical skills.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme          |  Primary Objective
    --------------------------|-------------------------
    1.  NIPUN Bharat Mission    | Foundational literacy and numeracy
    2. PM SHRI Scheme          |  Skill development for the labor force
    3. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission | Universal health coverage
    4. Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana | Youth skill development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NIPUN Bharat Mission focuses on foundational literacy and numeracy. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission aims for universal health coverage. The Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana, a youth skill development scheme, is correctly matched. However, the PM SHRI scheme aims to improve the quality of schools, aligning with the National Education Policy 2020, not skill development for the labor force. This makes option (d) incorrect, and options (a) and (b) are also incorrect due to the mismatched pair of PM SHRI scheme and its objective. This question assesses factual recall and conceptual understanding of various government schemes and their primary objectives.  The close similarity between some objectives makes this a difficult question.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ombudsman Scheme           |  Unified Framework Under Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (2021)
    ---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Banking Ombudsman        |  Included
    2. Non-Banking Financial Companies Ombudsman | Included
    3. Digital Transactions Ombudsman | Included
    4. Insurance Ombudsman      | Not Included


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (2021) unifies the Banking Ombudsman, Non-Banking Financial Companies Ombudsman, and Digital Transactions Ombudsman schemes.  The information provided does not mention the inclusion or exclusion of an Insurance Ombudsman under this unified framework.  Therefore, option (d) is incorrect. Options (b) and (c) are also incorrect as they do not include all three correctly matched pairs. This question tests the ability to analyze the given information and draw inferences.  The nuanced nature of the answer makes this question difficult.  This question tests application of knowledge and understanding of policy integration.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Program      |  Implementing Ministry
    ------------------------|-------------------------
    1. Project PARI           | Ministry of Power
    2. SEHER Program         | Ministry of Women & Child Development
    3. Asmita Project         | Ministry of Culture
    4. Naavu Manujaru Programme | Ministry of Education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Naavu Manujaru Programme is correctly matched with the Ministry of Education.  However, Project PARI is an initiative of the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Power. The SEHER Programme is related to financial literacy and empowerment of women entrepreneurs, not directly under the Ministry of Women & Child Development. The Asmita Project aims to produce high-quality study materials in native languages, and it is an initiative of the Union Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Culture.  This question tests factual recall and requires precise knowledge of the implementing ministries for different government programs.  Incorrect options would misrepresent the implementing ministry for at least one program. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the governmental structure of various projects.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                          Implementing Ministry/Organization
1. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)     :   Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
2. Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana :   Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
3. Asmita Project                                  :   Ministry of Culture
4.  NIPUN Bharat Mission                         :   Ministry of Women and Child Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Asmita Project is implemented by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti (BBS), which fall under the Ministry of Education.  The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development. The Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana is a state-level scheme implemented by the Maharashtra government, not a central ministry.  The NIPUN Bharat Mission is launched by the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The other options incorrectly link schemes with ministries that are not involved in their implementation.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the organizational structure of government schemes in India.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme                                          Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)     :   Focuses on connecting habitations with populations below 100.
2. Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana :   Provides internships of 12 months duration.
3.  Integrated Ombudsman Scheme                :   Covers complaints related to postal services.
4.  KIRTI                                          :    Targets children aged 10 to 19 years.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. KIRTI targets school children between nine and 18 years.  PMGSY aims to connect habitations with populations above 250 in plain areas and 100 in special category states.  The Maharashtra internship scheme offers six-month internships, not twelve.  The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme brings together banking, NBFC, and digital transaction ombudsman schemes; it does not include postal services.  This question tests detailed factual recall about specific scheme features, requiring careful attention to detail to avoid the plausible distractors.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                          Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan :   Focuses on skill development of urban youth.
2. Vatsalya Pension Scheme                     :   Targets senior citizens above 70 years of age.
3. Purvodaya Plan                               :   Aims for the development of the eastern region of India.
4.  PM SHRI School Scheme                      :   Exclusively for students from scheduled castes.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Purvodaya Plan aims at the all-round development of the eastern region of India.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan focuses on the socio-economic development of tribals, not urban youth. The Vatsalya Pension Scheme is for minors, not senior citizens. The PM SHRI School Scheme aims to improve the quality of education for all students, not exclusively for scheduled castes.  This question tests the understanding of the specific objectives of various government schemes, requiring the candidate to differentiate between similar-sounding schemes.



**4.  With reference to the Union Budget 2024-25, consider the following pairs:**

    Budget Proposal                                   Amount/Feature
1.  Total outlay for a new skilling scheme         :   Rs. 10,000 crore
2.  Increased standard deduction for salaried employees :   Rs. 1,00,000
3.  Financial support for higher education loans    :   Up to Rs. 20 lakh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is partially correct. The budget proposed a new centrally sponsored scheme with a total outlay of Rs. 60,000 crore, aiming to skill 20 lakh youth over five years. This is different from Rs. 10,000 crore mentioned in the option. The standard deduction for salaried employees was increased to Rs. 75,000, not Rs. 1,00,000. Financial support for higher education loans was up to Rs. 10 lakh, not Rs. 20 lakh. The question tests precise numerical recall from the budget details and highlights the importance of accuracy in such factual recall questions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme                                         Nodal Ministry
1. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission                 :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2.  PM SHRI School Scheme                         :   Ministry of Rural Development
3.  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN):   Ministry of Finance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission falls under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The PM SHRI School Scheme is overseen by the Ministry of Education.  PM-KISAN falls under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. This question tests the knowledge of the nodal ministries responsible for implementing various schemes, emphasizing the importance of understanding government organizational structure.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates who may have a general idea but lack precise knowledge.

5. Malabar                   :   Thailand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nomadic Elephant is a joint military exercise between India and Mongolia.  Therefore, pairing 1 is incorrect. Pitch Black is a biennial, multinational exercise hosted by Australia, not the United Kingdom. Thus, pairing 2 is incorrect.  Khaan Quest is a multinational peacekeeping exercise primarily involving Mongolia and various other countries, including participation from India since 2006. Therefore, pairing 3 is incorrect. Birlestik-2024 is a military exercise involving Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, but not India. Therefore, pairing 4 is incorrect. Exercise Malabar is a joint naval exercise between India, Japan, the US, and Australia, not Thailand. Hence, pairing 5 is incorrect. Only option (d) reflects the correct pairing, indicating a lack of correct matches among options 1,2,3, and 5.  The exercise Birlestik-2024 involves Azerbaijan, making option (d) the only correct answer.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rudram-1 utilizes INS-GPS navigation and a passive homing head for guidance, not an active radar seeker. Therefore, pairing 1 is incorrect. Agni Prime uses Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and GPS for guidance, making pairing 2 correct.  BrahMos uses an active radar seeker for guidance, not a passive homing head. Consequently, pairing 3 is incorrect. Only option (b) accurately reflects the correct matching, highlighting the exclusive use of INS-GPS for Agni Prime's guidance system. The other options incorrectly pair  Rudram-1 and/or BrahMos with the wrong guidance systems.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Relationship with India
1. Pakistan                    :   Most Favored Nation (MFN) status granted

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only

India withdrew MFN status from Pakistan. Therefore, pairing 1 is incorrect.  India and Bangladesh have a signed land boundary demarcation agreement, making pairing 2 correct. India and Mongolia conduct the Nomadic Elephant exercise, making pairing 3 correct.  Australia hosts Exercise Pitch Black, not India.  Therefore, pairing 4 is incorrect. Option (b) correctly identifies that only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The other options include incorrect pairings related to India's relationships with Pakistan and Australia.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Project                       Domain
1. Project Zorawar              :   Indian Navy's maritime security

Which of the above pairs is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Project Zorawar is related to the Indian Army's need for lighter tanks, not the Indian Navy's maritime security operations.  Therefore, pairing 1 is incorrect. Project Divyastra is a military operation conducted by India, not a space defense project. Hence, pairing 2 is incorrect. Project Tri-Netra is related to the development of hypersonic missile technology, making pairing 3 correct. Only option (c) correctly identifies the match for Project Tri-Netra.  The other options incorrectly link Project Zorawar and Project Divyastra to the wrong domains.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Tushil and Tamal are related to the Indian Navy's future frigates, not ISRO's space missions.  Therefore, pairing 1 is incorrect. Tamal is a frigate, not a DRDO missile project. Hence pairing 2 is incorrect. SEBEX-2 is a new explosive developed by Economic Explosives Limited, making pairing 3 correct. Only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairing, highlighting SEBEX-2's association with Economic Explosives Limited. The other options incorrectly associate Tushil and Tamal with the wrong domains.

Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. The NSC Secretariat (NSCS) is responsible for coordinating the work of the NSC and its subsidiary bodies, making statement 3 correct. Only option (b) correctly identifies statement 3 as the only true statement. The other options incorrectly include the false statements 1 and/or 2.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Australia is known for its extensive coal reserves and other minerals, not primarily thorium. Therefore, pairing 1 is incorrect. India is a major producer and exporter of mica, making pairing 2 correct. China has significant bauxite reserves, but it's not its most defining natural resource. Therefore, pairing 3 is incorrect.  Russia is known for its oil and gas resources, as well as various other minerals, but not predominantly manganese ore.  Therefore, pairing 4 is incorrect.

(c) 4 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Security Council (NSC) is headed by the Prime Minister, not the President of India. Therefore, pairing 1 is incorrect.  The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is under the Ministry of Defence and does not report to the Cabinet Secretary.  Therefore, pairing 2 is incorrect.  Economic Explosives Limited is a private company and does not have General Manoj Pande as its head. Therefore, pairing 3 is incorrect.  The World Health Organization (WHO) was not founded by Mahbub ul-Haq. Therefore, pairing 4 is incorrect.  Option (d) accurately reflects that none of the pairs are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly attribute leadership positions to individuals.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Milan is a biennial multinational naval exercise initiated by the Indian Navy in 1995.  The initial participating nations included Indonesia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.  Over time, the participation has likely evolved, but the core group of nations mentioned in option (a) accurately reflects the historical and ongoing involvement of these navies in the exercise.

Cutlass Express is a US-led multinational maritime exercise focused on enhancing maritime security and cooperation in East Africa and the Western Indian Ocean.  The Indian Navy's consistent participation in this exercise is well-documented.  Option (b) correctly identifies the participation of the Indian and US Navies.

Exercise Sea Dragon is a multinational maritime exercise designed to improve interoperability among participating navies. The Indian Navy, along with the US Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Republic of Korea Navy, and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, are key participants. Option (c) accurately reflects the participation of these naval forces. Therefore, all three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Operation       Conducting Force
1. Operation Sankalp       :   Indian Coast Guard
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda : Indian Navy
3. Operation Talwar         :   Indian Army


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Operation Sankalp is a maritime security operation primarily conducted by the Indian Coast Guard to safeguard India's maritime interests.  While the Indian Navy might provide support, the Coast Guard is the primary force responsible. Option (a) is incorrect as it misattributes the conducting force.

Operation Crimson Barracuda is a naval operation undertaken by the Indian Navy. This operation likely involves various naval assets and personnel and focuses on a specific maritime security or defense objective. Option (c) is incorrect as it omits a correctly matched pair.

Operation Talwar is a military operation conducted by the Indian Army, often involving land-based operations and ground forces.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Naval Vessel           Belongs to
1. INS Sandhayak          :   Indian Coast Guard

3. INS Shivalik             :   Indian Army


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

INS Sandhayak is a naval vessel belonging to the Indian Navy, not the Indian Coast Guard.  The Indian Coast Guard operates its own fleet of ships and aircraft. Option (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or omit the correctly matched pair.

INS Jatayu is a naval base, and while it's part of the Indian Navy's infrastructure, it's not a naval vessel itself. Options (a), (b) and (d) are thus incorrect.

INS Shivalik is an Indian Navy frigate, a type of warship.  The Indian Army operates land-based forces and equipment, not naval vessels. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Weapon System          Used by
1. Varunastra             :   Indian Air Force
2. Rampage Missiles       :   Indian Navy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Varunastra is a torpedo system, a naval weapon. It is employed by the Indian Navy, not the Indian Air Force. Option (a) incorrectly pairs Varunastra with the Air Force.

Rampage missiles are anti-ship missiles used by the Indian Navy for naval warfare operations. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes the usage of a weapon system.

MQ-9B Reaper is a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone, and while the Indian Navy operates drones, the MQ-9B Reaper is not definitively confirmed to be in the Coast Guard's arsenal. Option (b) is incorrect as it includes an incorrectly matched pair. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Military Exercise       Originated by
1. MILAN                    :   Pakistan Navy
2. Cutlass Express         :   United States Navy
3. Exercise Sea Dragon     :   Royal Australian Navy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

MILAN is a biennial multinational naval exercise conceived by the Indian Navy, not the Pakistan Navy. Option (a) and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.

Cutlass Express is a US-led multinational maritime exercise, accurately reflecting the US Navy's role in its origin.

Exercise Sea Dragon is a multinational maritime exercise. While several navies participate, it's not definitively attributed to a single originating navy. Option (c) is incorrect due to an incorrectly matched pair.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Capability       Enhanced by
1. Anti-submarine warfare :   Acquisition of MQ-9B Sea Guardian
2. Anti-air warfare         :   Deployment of Akash Missile System
3. Electronic Warfare       :   Development of  Drishti UAV system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The acquisition of the MQ-9B Sea Guardian significantly enhances the Indian Navy's anti-submarine warfare capabilities due to its advanced surveillance and targeting systems. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes a wrongly matched pair.

The deployment of the Akash Missile System directly enhances India's anti-air warfare capabilities by providing a robust short-range air defense system.

The Drishti UAV system enhances surveillance capabilities, but its primary function isn't directly related to electronic warfare.  Electronic warfare involves disrupting enemy communications and sensor systems; while surveillance is related, it's not a direct synonym. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits a correctly matched pair. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Helicopter       Operated by
1. MH-60 Romeo             :   Indian Air Force
2. Mi-17V5                 :   Indian Army

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The MH-60 Romeo is a multi-role helicopter primarily operated by the Indian Navy, not the Indian Air Force.  The Air Force operates its own helicopter fleet. Option (a) and (d) incorrectly match the helicopter type with the operating force.

The Mi-17V5 is a Russian-made transport and utility helicopter widely used by the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army for various purposes. Option (d) is thus incorrect.

The TAPAS BH-201 is a medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) UAV, not a helicopter, and is operated by the Indian Air Force, not the Indian Navy. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Navy is a part of the Theatre Commands.
2. The Indian Army is a part of the Theatre Commands.
3. The Indian Air Force is a part of the Theatre Commands.

How many of the statements given above are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The reorganization of the Indian Armed Forces into integrated theatre commands aims to improve joint operational effectiveness.  This restructuring incorporates the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force under the umbrella of geographically defined theatre commands. Each service branch contributes its unique capabilities within the theatre command structure.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Location     Indian Naval Operations
1. Cocos (Keeling) Islands  :   Regular patrols and surveillance

3.  Chloropicrin              :   Russian Federation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

SEBEX 2 is a chemical compound, and while the Indian Navy might use or test it,  it is not definitively certified by the Indian Army. The Indian Army primarily deals with land-based military operations.  Option (d) is thus incorrect.

Xylitol is a sugar alcohol regulated by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which sets international food safety standards.

Chloropicrin is a chemical compound, and while it's associated with Russia in some contexts, it is not specifically certified by the Russian Federation. Option (a) and (b) are thus incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                         Country
1.  Brahmaputra                India

3.  Ganges                      Nepal
4.  Mekong                      China
5.  Yangtze                     Myanmar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Brahmaputra River flows through India and Bangladesh.  The Ganges River flows through India and Nepal. The Mekong River flows through several Southeast Asian countries, including China. The Yangtze River is entirely within China. The Indus River primarily flows through Pakistan. Option (b) correctly identifies that the Brahmaputra flows through India, the Ganges flows through India and Nepal, and the Mekong flows through China.  Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the Mekong River's flow through China. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the Yangtze, which is entirely within China and excludes the Mekong. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly includes the Indus River flowing through Bangladesh.  The question tests factual recall of major rivers and their flow through specific countries, requiring the candidate to identify accurate pairings amidst plausible distractors.  Understanding the geography of major Asian rivers is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Major Product
1.  India                       Jute
2.  Bangladesh                 Tea
3.  China                       Rice
4.  Nepal                       Spices
5.  Myanmar                    Cotton


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India is a major producer of jute, though Bangladesh is the largest producer globally. Bangladesh is a significant producer of tea. China is a massive producer and exporter of rice. Nepal produces spices, but not on a scale comparable to India or other major spice-producing nations. Myanmar is known for its rice production more so than cotton.  Therefore, only pairs 1 (India-Jute) and 3 (China-Rice) are accurately matched. Option (b) is incorrect because neither Nepal nor Bangladesh is a primary spice or tea exporter, respectively. Option (c) is incorrect because Myanmar is not a major cotton producer, while China is more known for rice. Option (d) is incorrect as it contains several mismatched pairs. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of major agricultural products associated with specific Asian countries, assessing factual recall and requiring careful analysis of each pair.


**3. With reference to the Bay of Bengal, consider the following pairs:**

3.  Myanmar                    Saint Martin's Island
4.  Sri Lanka                   Andaman Islands
5.  Thailand                    Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sundarbans mangrove forest is a significant coastal feature shared by India and Bangladesh. Rameswaram is an island in the Gulf of Mannar, off the coast of India. Saint Martin's Island belongs to Bangladesh.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are Indian territories in the Bay of Bengal, but not directly on the coast of Sri Lanka. Similarly, the Nicobar Islands are not coastal to Thailand. Therefore, only pair 1 (India-Sundarbans) is correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the geographical location of islands and coastal features. Option (b) incorrectly pairs Bangladesh with Saint Martin's Island, a part of Bangladesh itself, and Myanmar with a coastal feature in Bangladesh. Option (c) wrongly associates the Nicobar Islands with Thailand. Option (d) contains multiple incorrect pairings.  The question assesses factual recall of geographical features and their association with countries in the Bay of Bengal region, testing the candidate's geographical knowledge and analytical skills.

4.  Nepal                         Brahmaputra
5.  Myanmar                      Irrawaddy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ganga River basin is primarily located in India and  Nepal. The Irrawaddy River basin is located in Myanmar.  The Mekong River basin is in Southeast Asia, not in India. The Indus River basin is mainly in Pakistan, not Bangladesh. The Brahmaputra River basin is not mainly located in Nepal. Therefore, only pairs 3 (China-Ganga) and 5 (Myanmar-Irrawaddy) are correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect because they contain mismatched pairs. Option (a) incorrectly pairs India with the Mekong and China with the Ganga. Option (c) mismatches Nepal with the Brahmaputra. Option (d) includes several incorrect pairings.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of major river basins in Asia and their location within specific countries, testing their geographical knowledge and analytical ability to identify correct pairings from a list of plausible distractors.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

3.  China                       South China Sea
4.  Nepal                       Bay of Bengal
5.  Myanmar                     Andaman Sea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India has a coastline on the Arabian Sea.  Bangladesh has a coastline on the Bay of Bengal, which is part of the Indian Ocean. China borders the South China Sea. Nepal is a landlocked country and doesn't border any sea. Myanmar has a coastline on the Andaman Sea. Therefore, only pairs 1 (India-Arabian Sea), 3 (China-South China Sea), and 5 (Myanmar-Andaman Sea) are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect as it wrongly includes Bangladesh bordering the Indian Ocean directly (it borders the Bay of Bengal, which is part of the Indian Ocean). Option (c) wrongly includes Nepal. Option (d) is incorrect because it contains several mismatched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical location of Asian countries relative to major seas and oceans, demanding precise factual recall and analytical skills to correctly match pairs amidst plausible distractors.  The ability to accurately identify a country's maritime boundaries is essential for UPSC preparation.

5.  Myanmar                        Rangoon (Yangon)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

New Delhi is the capital of India. Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh. Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal. Yangon (formerly Rangoon) is the capital of Myanmar.  Shanghai is a major city in China but not its capital; Beijing is the capital of China.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (b) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes Yangon as the capital of Myanmar. Option (c) is incorrect as it wrongly includes Yangon (Rangoon) and excludes Kathmandu. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes Shanghai, which is not the capital of China. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of capital cities of major Asian countries, requiring accurate factual recall and the ability to differentiate between major cities and capital cities.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Regional Organization          Headquartered in
1.  SAARC                         Kathmandu
2.  BIMSTEC                       Dhaka
3.  ASEAN                         Jakarta
4.  SCO                            Beijing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

BIMSTEC is headquartered in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The SCO's secretariat is in Beijing, China.  SAARC's secretariat is in Kathmandu, Nepal.  ASEAN's secretariat is in Jakarta, Indonesia. ADPC is headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand; not Colombo, Sri Lanka. Therefore, only pairs 2 (BIMSTEC-Dhaka) and 4 (SCO-Beijing) are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the headquarters locations of various regional organizations. Option (b) incorrectly states that ASEAN is headquartered in Jakarta. Option (c) misplaces SAARC's headquarters. Option (d) contains multiple incorrect pairings.  The question assesses factual recall of the headquarters of significant regional organizations in Asia, requiring the candidate to demonstrate knowledge of these organizations' administrative structures.


**8. With reference to major Asian countries, consider the following pairs:**

    Country                     Official Language

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Hindi is an official language of India, it is not the *only* official language.  India has multiple official languages.  Bengali is an official language of Bangladesh. Mandarin is an official language of China. Nepali is the official language of Nepal. Burmese is the official language of Myanmar. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes Burmese. Option (c) is incorrect as it mistakenly claims Hindi is the only official language of India. Option (d) is incorrect because it contains the inaccurate statement about Hindi being the sole official language of India.  This question tests factual recall about the official languages of major Asian countries.  Understanding the linguistic diversity of these nations is important for UPSC preparation.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India is a major exporter of software services. Bangladesh is a significant exporter of jute. China exports a vast range of manufactured goods. Nepal exports hydroelectricity. Myanmar exports rice.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of major export commodities of various Asian countries, demanding a comprehensive understanding of their economies and international trade.  This is a crucial area for UPSC aspirants.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country          Significant Maritime Feature
    1. China           :   Spratly Islands
    2. Philippines     :   Scarborough Shoal
    3. Indonesia       :   Natuna Islands
    4. Vietnam         :   Paracel Islands
    5. Malaysia        :   Taiwan Strait

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

China's claim to the South China Sea is largely based on the nine-dash line, which encompasses the Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, and other features.  The Philippines has a long-standing dispute with China over the Scarborough Shoal. Indonesia asserts sovereignty over the Natuna Islands, which are within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) but are also claimed by China. Vietnam also has overlapping claims with China in the South China Sea, notably over the Paracel Islands. The Taiwan Strait, while geographically adjacent to the South China Sea, is not a maritime feature directly claimed by Malaysia in the same manner as the other islands and features listed. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes Vietnam’s claim to the Paracel Islands, a significant point of contention in the South China Sea dispute. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate pairing of Malaysia and the Taiwan Strait. Option (d) is too narrow, omitting several key territorial disputes in the region.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Treaty/Agreement   Application Area
    1. UNCLOS                        :   Taiwan Strait

    3. ASEAN Declaration              :   Indonesia
    4. Bangkok Declaration            :   BIMSTEC
    5. TAC                            :   Philippines

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is a significant international treaty governing maritime boundaries and activities in international waters, including the South China Sea, and therefore indirectly applies to the Taiwan Strait.  The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) includes Brunei as a member state.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established by the ASEAN Declaration (also known as the Bangkok Declaration) and includes Indonesia as a founding member.  The Bangkok Declaration is not directly related to BIMSTEC;  the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) was established by a separate declaration. The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC) is an agreement among ASEAN member states, including the Philippines. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the relationships between the treaties/agreements and their areas of application/membership. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Feature        Location in South China Sea
    1. Scarborough Shoal          :   Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Vietnam
    2. Spratly Islands              :   Near Taiwan
    3. Paracel Islands              :   Disputed between China and Vietnam
    4. Natuna Islands               :   Within Indonesia's EEZ
    5. Taiwan Strait                :   Adjacent to the Philippines

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Scarborough Shoal is primarily within the EEZ of the Philippines, not Vietnam. The Spratly Islands are located within the South China Sea and are not specifically near Taiwan, though Taiwan has its own claims in the area. The Paracel Islands are indeed a significant point of contention between China and Vietnam. The Natuna Islands are correctly located within Indonesia's EEZ. The Taiwan Strait is adjacent to Taiwan, not the Philippines.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs.  Only pairs 3 and 4 are accurately matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country           Claim in the South China Sea
    1. Brunei           :   Part of the area encompassed by the nine-dash line
    2. Malaysia         :   Features within its EEZ are claimed by China
    3. Philippines       :   Has had its claims rejected by an international tribunal
    4. Vietnam          :   Claims overlapping with China's nine-dash line
    5. Indonesia        :   Has overlapping claims with China in the South China Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Brunei's EEZ is indeed partially overlapped by China's nine-dash line, creating a territorial dispute. Malaysia's EEZ also contains areas claimed by China under the nine-dash line. The Philippines successfully challenged China's claims in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, leading to a ruling against China's nine-dash line. Vietnam similarly has overlapping territorial claims with China in the South China Sea, particularly concerning features included within the nine-dash line. Indonesia also has areas within its EEZ that are claimed by China.  All five pairs are correctly matched; therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**5. Consider the following statements:**

    1. The Mekong River flows into the South China Sea.
    2. The UNCLOS applies to the South China Sea.
    3. The Philippines is a littoral state of the South China Sea.

How many of the statements given above are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Mekong River does indeed drain into the South China Sea.  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) sets the legal framework for maritime zones and activities, including those in the South China Sea. The Philippines shares a coastline with the South China Sea and is thus a littoral state. All three statements are factually correct.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country          Founding Member of ASEAN
    1. Indonesia       :   ASEAN
    2. Singapore       :   ASEAN

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand were the five founding members of ASEAN in 1967.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization      Headquarters Location
    1. ASEAN                         :   Jakarta, Indonesia

    3. ADB                            :   Manila, Philippines
    4. SCO                            :   Shanghai, China
    5. World Bank                     :   Washington D.C., USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the ASEAN Secretariat is located in Jakarta, Indonesia, ASEAN itself doesn't have a single headquarters in the same way that other international organizations do.  The UNFCCC's secretariat is in Bonn, Germany. The ADB's headquarters are in Manila, Philippines. The SCO's headquarters are in Beijing, China. The World Bank's headquarters are in Washington, D.C.  Option (a) is incorrect as it excludes the correct pairing of ADB and SCO. Option (b) is incorrect as it excludes the World Bank. Option (d) is incorrect because ASEAN's headquarters is not a single location. Option (c) correctly matches all but ASEAN.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Regional Organization     Member Country
    1. ASEAN                     :   Brunei
    2. BIMSTEC                  :   Myanmar
    3. SAARC                     :   Bangladesh
    4. SCO                        :   Pakistan
    5. IORA                       :   Sri Lanka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) All of the above
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Brunei is a member of ASEAN. Myanmar is a member of BIMSTEC. Bangladesh is a member of SAARC. Pakistan is a member of the SCO.  Sri Lanka is a member of IORA.  All five pairs are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                         Description
    1. CBAM                           :   Aims to put a fair price on carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods entering the EU.
    2.  Carbon Border Tax            :   A key component of the CBAM.
    3.  Green Climate Fund           :   A UN fund for climate mitigation and adaptation.
    4.  Loss and Damage Fund        :   A UN fund to compensate countries for climate change impacts.
    5.  Adaptation Fund               :   A UN fund supporting adaptation projects in developing countries.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The CBAM is designed to levy a carbon price on carbon-intensive goods imported into the EU, thus encouraging cleaner production in exporting countries. A carbon border tax is a direct mechanism used within the CBAM.  The Green Climate Fund, Loss and Damage Fund, and Adaptation Fund are separate UN initiatives focused on climate finance, not directly related to the CBAM. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include these unrelated UN funds. Option (a) accurately identifies the core components of the CBAM and their relationship.


**10.  Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization       Focus Area
    1.  ADB                           :   Eradicating extreme poverty
    2.  WHO                          :   Global health security
    3.  UNFCCC                       :   Climate change mitigation
    4.  ASEAN                         :   Regional economic integration
    5.  SCO                           :   Combating terrorism

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a stated goal of eradicating extreme poverty and promoting sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific.  The World Health Organization (WHO) is the leading UN agency for global health, including health security. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international treaty addressing climate change mitigation. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) promotes regional cooperation, particularly economic integration. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) focuses on regional security and cooperation, including combating terrorism. All five pairs correctly match the international organization with one of its key focus areas.  Therefore, option (b) is correct.  Other options incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.

The collaboration between ISRO and BARC on various space-related projects is a well-established fact, encompassing areas like nuclear power sources for satellites and other technological advancements.  The WHO's role in certifying countries as malaria-free is also a documented process.  Option (d) is incorrect because while NASA developed the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, the question does not provide enough information to confirm that NASA's involvement was solely responsible for the helicopter's development.  Other entities may have contributed to its creation.  Therefore, including it as a correctly matched pair is not definitively verifiable based solely on the provided information. Options (a) and (b) are subsets of the correct answer and therefore incomplete.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Agency                  Significant Project/Technology

2.  World Meteorological Organization (WMO):  Publication of the State of the Global Climate report
3.  Wildlife Institute of India (WII)     :  Publication of the 'State of India’s Birds' report
4.  Zoological Survey of India (ZSI)    :  Maintenance of the National Zoological Collection

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The WHO's focus on AMR is a central part of its mandate. The WMO's publication of the State of the Global Climate report is a key function.  The WII's role in compiling the 'State of India’s Birds' report is well-documented.  The ZSI is officially designated as the repository for the National Zoological Collection. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.

3.  Milky Way Galaxy                    :  Presence of Shiva and Shakti stellar structures
4.  Jupiter                             :  Presence of Cheyava Falls (as mentioned in the source text)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Olympus Mons is a well-known massive volcano on Mars. The Zero Shadow Day phenomenon occurs on Earth. The discovery of Shiva and Shakti stellar structures in the Milky Way is a confirmed event. The mention of Cheyava Falls on Jupiter is incorrect.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Virus/Disease                     Family/Characteristic

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Maharashtra is a major producer of sugarcane, making pair 1 correct. Gujarat is known for its significant cotton production, making pair 2 correct.  While Madhya Pradesh produces wheat, it is not its *major* crop compared to others like Soybean and pulses, making pair 3 incorrect. Rajasthan is a major producer of Bajra, making pair 4 correct. Odisha, while producing rice, isn't predominantly associated with it compared to states like West Bengal and Punjab, making pair 5 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  The options that include incorrect pairings (3 and 5) are incorrect. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of agricultural production patterns across different Indian states, a vital aspect of the UPSC syllabus.  The inclusion of plausible distractors (incorrect pairs) increases the difficulty level and assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between major and minor crop production.

3. Bt Cotton       :   Brinjal Fruit and Shoot Borer (FSB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bt cotton is engineered to be resistant to the cotton bollworm, specifically *Heliothis armigera*.  The pink bollworm (*Pectinophora gossypiella*) is another significant pest of cotton, and while some Bt cotton varieties may offer some level of control, it's not the primary target. Bt brinjal, on the other hand, is specifically designed to combat the brinjal fruit and shoot borer (*Leucinodes orbonalis*).  Therefore, only pair 1 accurately reflects the relationship between the GM crop and the pest it primarily targets. Pair 2 is incorrect because Bt brinjal targets the Brinjal Fruit and Shoot Borer, not the Pink Bollworm, which is a cotton pest. Pair 3 is incorrect as Bt cotton does not target the Brinjal Fruit and Shoot Borer; this pest affects brinjal plants, and Bt brinjal is designed for its control. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related GM crops and their target pests, a key aspect of agricultural biotechnology understanding within the UPSC syllabus.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   GM Crop          Company Involved
1. Bt Brinjal      :   Monsanto
2. Bt Cotton       :   Mahyco
3. DMH-11 Mustard :   Bayer Crop Science

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mahyco (Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company) played a significant role in the development and commercialization of Bt cotton in India.  Monsanto, while a major player in global agricultural biotechnology, was not directly involved in the development of Bt brinjal in India; Mahyco was a key developer of this crop.  Bayer Crop Science is involved in the development of DMH-11 mustard. Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 correctly link the GM crop with a company significantly involved in its development or commercialization.  Pair 1 is incorrect because Monsanto’s role in Bt brinjal development in India is not prominent.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the commercial aspects of agricultural biotechnology, relevant for understanding India's agricultural policies and their global context in the UPSC exam.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Industry Category     Pollution Index (PI) Score Range
1. White Category       :   0-20
2. Orange Category     :   21-40
3. Red Category         :   41-60
4. Green Category       :   61-100

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board's industrial categorization uses a Pollution Index (PI) score to classify industries based on their pollution potential. Industries with a PI score of 0-20 are classified as 'white,' those with 21-40 as 'orange,' and those with 41-60 as 'red.'  The Green category is not correctly defined in option 4. The provided score range 61-100 is incorrect. The correct range for the green category is typically above 20 and below 40. The question tests factual recall of specific numerical data related to environmental regulations and their application, a common theme in UPSC's Environment and Ecology section.  The inclusion of plausible, but incorrect, PI ranges for other categories serves as a significant distractor.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Framework/Agreement   Key Feature
1. Sendai Framework     :   Substantially reduce disaster risk by 2030
2. Paris Agreement       :   Limit global warming to well below 2°C
3. Kyoto Protocol         :   Established the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction aims to substantially reduce disaster risk and losses by 2030. The Paris Agreement sets the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C. The Kyoto Protocol introduced mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to facilitate emission reduction projects in developing countries.  All three pairs correctly match the framework or agreement with one of its key features. The question tests factual recall and understanding of international environmental agreements, a crucial component of the UPSC syllabus, particularly in the context of international relations and environmental studies.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Aquilaria malaccensis is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN.
2.  The oil and chips of Aquilaria malaccensis are highly valued for their aromatic properties.
3.  Aquilaria malaccensis is native to Northeast India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

*Aquilaria malaccensis*, also known as agarwood, is indeed listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to overexploitation for its valuable aromatic oil and wood chips.  The fragrant oil and chips derived from this tree are highly prized in the perfume and incense industries worldwide, leading to its unsustainable harvesting.  The species is native to Northeast India, as well as other parts of Southeast Asia and Bangladesh.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, showcasing the intersection of conservation biology, international trade, and geographical distribution—topics frequently covered in the UPSC exam.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the conservation status of a specific plant species, testing knowledge relevant to the environment and ecology section of the UPSC syllabus.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization              Activity/Role
1. Central Zoo Authority (CZA):   Regulates Cheetah Conservation Breeding Centres only
2. WWF                       :   Documents illegal sturgeon fishing and trade
3. IUCN                       :   Lists Aquilaria malaccensis as Critically Endangered


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) published a report documenting cases of illegal sturgeon fishing and trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains the Red List of Threatened Species, which includes *Aquilaria malaccensis* as Critically Endangered.  The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has a broader mandate than just regulating cheetah breeding centres; it oversees the management of zoos and the conservation of various animal species in India.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 correctly link the organization to its reported activity.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles of key organizations involved in wildlife conservation and trade monitoring, demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of the UPSC exam, encompassing aspects of environment and governance.  The distractor in option 1 plays on the specific mention of cheetah conservation in the source material, but the CZA's broader role is a critical point to understand for UPSC preparation.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  India communicated a 33% reduction in energy emissions intensity from 2005-2019.
2.  India committed to sourcing 50% of its electricity from non-fossil fuel resources by 2030.
3.  India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) include commitments to reduce emissions intensity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India has officially reported a 33% reduction in its energy emissions intensity between 2005 and 2019, exceeding its initial target.  The updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) further commit to a 45% reduction by 2030. However, the statement about sourcing 50% of electricity from non-fossil fuel resources by 2030 is incorrect; India's commitment is to achieve a significant increase in non-fossil fuel-based electricity generation, but not necessarily 50%.  Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The question tests the ability to accurately recall and evaluate specific numerical data and policy commitments related to climate change mitigation in India, a recurring theme in the UPSC examination.  The distractor in option 2 cleverly uses a plausible, but ultimately inaccurate, percentage related to renewable energy targets.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Species                       IUCN Status
1. *Minervarya charlesdarwini*:   Critically Endangered
2. Western Hoolock Gibbon     :   Vulnerable
3. Aquilaria khasiana          :   Endangered

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

*Minervarya charlesdarwini* (Charles Darwin’s frog) is listed as Vulnerable, not Critically Endangered, by the IUCN. The Western Hoolock Gibbon is also listed as Endangered, not Vulnerable.  *Aquilaria khasiana* is listed as Endangered by the IUCN.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests factual recall of the conservation status of different species, requiring knowledge of the IUCN Red List categories and their application to specific species, which is relevant to the environment and ecology section of the UPSC exam. The distractors in options 1 and 2 utilize similar IUCN categories, making the correct identification challenging.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Location                      Significant Feature
1. Banni Grasslands, Gujarat   :   Historically inhabited by cheetahs
2. Andaman Islands            :   Endemic to *Minervarya charlesdarwini*
3. Northeast India            :   Native habitat of *Aquilaria malaccensis*

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Historical records confirm the presence of cheetahs in the Banni grasslands of Gujarat before their extinction in the region.  *Minervarya charlesdarwini* is endemic to the Andaman Islands.  *Aquilaria malaccensis* is native to Northeast India and parts of Southeast Asia.  Thus, all three pairs correctly link the location with its significant feature. This question tests factual recall and the understanding of geographical distribution of species and historical ecological contexts, relevant to the geography and environment sections of the UPSC exam.  The inclusion of diverse geographical locations and species as distractors increases the difficulty level.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                          State/Region
1. Teesta River                 :   Meghalaya only
2. Manas River                 :   Bhutan and Assam
3. Brahmaputra River           :   Arunachal Pradesh only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Teesta River flows through Sikkim and West Bengal, and also forms part of the boundary between India and Bangladesh. The Manas River flows through Bhutan and Assam.  The Brahmaputra River flows through Tibet, India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal), and Bangladesh.  Only pair 2 correctly identifies the states/regions through which the Manas River flows.  The question tests knowledge of Indian geography, specifically river systems and their course, a frequently tested area in the UPSC geography syllabus. The distractors in options 1 and 3 use rivers that flow through multiple states, increasing the complexity for the candidate.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State               Geographical Feature
1. Andhra Pradesh     :   Western Ghats (rain shadow effect)
2. Maharashtra         :   Sahyadris
3. Karnataka           :   Nilgiri Hills (part of)
4. Tamil Nadu          :   Periyar River (originates in)
5. Kerala              :   Western Ghats (located in)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because Andhra Pradesh experiences the rain shadow effect of the Western Ghats, and Kerala is indeed located within the Western Ghats mountain range.  The Western Ghats significantly influence the rainfall patterns in Andhra Pradesh, creating a drier region in its lee.  Kerala, being situated along the Western Ghats' southwestern slope, is directly impacted by its presence and geographical features.


Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.  While the Sahyadris are an alternative name for the Western Ghats (making pair 2 partially correct),  the direct relationship stated in pair 2 isn't accurate enough for a precise match in a UPSC-style question. The Nilgiri Hills are a part of the Western Ghats, not the other way around (pair 3 is incorrect). The Periyar River originates in the Western Ghats, but Tamil Nadu is not directly linked to its origin in the same way as Kerala or Karnataka (pair 4 is incorrect).  The question requires precise and verifiable connections, and only pairs 1 and 5 meet this criterion.  The other pairs either contain inaccuracies or lack the specificity required for a definitive match.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                     Focus Area
1. Gadgil Committee               :   Western Ghats conservation
2. Kasturirangan Committee       :   Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA) designation
3. Western Ghats Experts Ecology Panel (WGEEP) :   Biodiversity hotspots
4. High-Level Working Group (HLWG) :   Sustainable development goals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gadgil Committee and the Kasturirangan Committee both focused on the Western Ghats, but with different emphases. The Gadgil Committee's report provided a comprehensive assessment of the Western Ghats' ecology and recommended extensive conservation measures, while the Kasturirangan Committee focused on the designation of Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) within the Western Ghats.  The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) also contributed to understanding of the Western Ghats' biodiversity, making it a significant player in the overall assessment of the region's biodiversity hotspots.


Option (d) is incorrect because the High-Level Working Group (HLWG) is a broader committee.  While its recommendations may touch upon aspects of Western Ghats conservation, its primary focus isn't limited to that specific region. The HLWG's scope encompasses more widely defined sustainable development goals, a much broader theme than the focused assessments of the other committees. The question tests the examinee's ability to distinguish between specific and general committee mandates.


**3.  With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following pairs:**

   State          Specific Characteristic
1. Karnataka       :   Highest peak of Anamudi
2. Tamil Nadu      :   Largest mangrove cover in India
3. Kerala           :   Location of Malabar Coast
4. Maharashtra     :   Location of Mahabaleshwar
5. Goa             :   Highest rainfall area


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Mahabaleshwar is indeed located in the Western Ghats in Maharashtra.  The other pairs contain inaccuracies. Anamudi is the highest peak in the Western Ghats but is located in Kerala, not Karnataka (pair 1 is incorrect).  West Bengal has the largest mangrove cover in India, not Tamil Nadu (pair 2 is incorrect). The Malabar Coast is blocked by the Western Ghats, but its location is not solely in Kerala,  it extends to other states (pair 3 is incorrect). While parts of the Western Ghats in Maharashtra receive high rainfall, designating the entire state as the 'highest rainfall area' is an oversimplification (pair 5 is incorrect). This question tests the candidate's ability to discern specific geographical details related to the Western Ghats and identify the accurately matched pair among several plausible distractors.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                 State/Region of Origin within Western Ghats
1. Sharavati River       :   Karnataka
2. Cauvery River         :   Tamil Nadu
3. Pamba River           :   Kerala
4. Godavari River        :   Maharashtra
5. Mahadayi River       :   Goa


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sharavati River originates in Karnataka within the Western Ghats; the Pamba River originates in Kerala within the Western Ghats; and the Mahadayi River originates in Goa within the Western Ghats. These are all accurate pairings of rivers and their origins within the Western Ghats mountain range.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in the pairings. The Cauvery River's origin is in Karnataka, not Tamil Nadu (pair 2 is incorrect). The Godavari River's origin is not within the Western Ghats (pair 4 is incorrect).  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geography of the Western Ghats and their ability to accurately match rivers to their origin points within the range.  The inclusion of plausible distractors increases the difficulty level.


**5. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Committee         Action/Report
1. UNESCO                        :   Declared Ecologically Sensitive Areas
2. Gadgil Committee               :   Recommended a 1 km ESZ around national parks
3. Kasturirangan Committee       :   Proposed the Western Ghats Ecology Authority
4. High-Level Working Group (HLWG):   Finalized the extent of ESZs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kasturirangan Committee proposed the creation of the Western Ghats Ecology Authority, and the Gadgil Committee recommended a 1 km Ecologically Sensitive Zone (ESZ) around national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the Western Ghats. These are accurate reflections of the actions and reports of these committees.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because UNESCO did not declare Ecologically Sensitive Areas (pair 1 is incorrect).  The High-Level Working Group (HLWG) offered recommendations, but the finalization of ESZ extent is a governmental process, not solely the responsibility of the HLWG (pair 4 is incorrect).  The question tests knowledge of specific environmental committees and their functions.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes it challenging to identify the correctly matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   UPSC Examination Feature              Detail
1.  Civil Services Examination             :   Conducted by CSPU
2.  Preliminary Examination               :   Includes Indian Art and Culture in syllabus
3.  Main Examination                     :   Evaluates proficient answer writing skills
4.  Syllabus                              :   Defines exam topics like Visual Arts and Environment
5.  Resource for UPSC aspirants          :   upscstudyhub.com


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because statements 4 and 5 accurately reflect facts about the UPSC. The UPSC syllabus indeed defines the exam topics, including subjects like Visual Arts and Environment.  Furthermore, upscstudyhub.com is a publicly available website that serves as a resource for UPSC aspirants, offering study materials and other relevant information.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Civil Services Examination is a major component of the UPSC, it is not conducted solely by CSPU. The UPSC itself is the primary conducting body. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Preliminary Examination does not include Indian Art and Culture as a direct, standalone subject in its syllabus. While the subject might be indirectly tested through General Studies, it's not a dedicated component. Statement 3 is partially correct in that the Main Examination assesses answer-writing skills. However,  "proficient answer writing skills" is a subjective description rather than a specific, verifiable fact about the examination's structure.  The Main Examination assesses a wide range of skills, and answer writing is one component among many.


**2. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following pairs:**

   UPSC Aspect                          Specific Detail
1.  Exam Location                         :   Ranchi
2.  Exam Conducted                         :   Civil Services Examination
3.  Resource Provided                     :   Previous year’s questions
4.  Accountable to                          :  President of India
5.  Relevant to Examination Syllabus      :   UNESCO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The UPSC conducts the Civil Services Examination, a well-known fact.  The UPSC also provides previous years' question papers as a resource for aspirants, aiding their preparation.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ranchi is a potential exam center, it is not a definitive or exclusive location. The UPSC conducts examinations across numerous cities. Statement 4 is incorrect; the UPSC is accountable to the Parliament through the Government of India, not directly to the President. Statement 5 is incorrect. While the UPSC syllabus might touch upon topics related to international organizations like UNESCO, UNESCO itself is not a direct component of the UPSC syllabus.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                             Function/Association
1.  UPSC                                   :   Assists in joint recruitment with states
2.  RBI                                    :   Regulates Commercial Banks
3.  Ministry of Education                 :   Implements National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
4.  Parliament                             :   Can extend jurisdiction of UPSC
5.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :   Operates UPI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer because statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all factually accurate.  The RBI does regulate commercial banks in India. The Ministry of Education is responsible for the implementation of the NEP 2020.  Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, which defines the UPSC's role and jurisdiction, allowing it to expand or alter the UPSC's powers.  Finally, NPCI is the organization that operates the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

Statement 1, however, is not entirely accurate. While the UPSC collaborates with state governments on certain recruitments, "assists in joint recruitment" is a broad statement. The UPSC's role is primarily in recruiting for All-India Services and Central services, not in directly assisting state-level recruitments in a consistently joint manner.


**4. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Action/Function                     Related Entity/Concept
1.  Issues Currency Notes                   :   One Rupee Note
2.  Regulates                               :   NABARD
3.  Debt Manager for                         :   State Governments
4.  Implements Monetary Policy              :   MPC decisions
5.  Provides Funds to                       :   Banks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The RBI regulates NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) as a crucial financial institution within the Indian financial system.  The RBI also acts as a debt manager for state governments, managing their borrowings and debt obligations.  Further, the RBI provides funds to commercial banks through various mechanisms, ensuring liquidity and stability in the banking sector.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI issues currency notes except for the one-rupee note, which is issued by the Ministry of Finance. Statement 4 is incorrect; the RBI implements monetary policy, but it is not directly bound by *all* MPC decisions. While the MPC's recommendations heavily influence RBI's actions, the RBI retains some degree of independent decision-making.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts the Civil Services Examination.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the central bank of India.
3.  The Ministry of Education is responsible for the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct.  The UPSC's primary function is to conduct the Civil Services Examination for recruitment into various civil services in India. The RBI is unequivocally the central bank of India, responsible for managing monetary policy and regulating the banking sector. The Ministry of Education is the nodal ministry for the implementation of the NEP 2020, a major education reform initiative in India. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of these statements.  Therefore, option (c) is the only correct choice.

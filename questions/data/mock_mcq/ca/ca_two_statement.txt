Here are five UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to Ahilyabai Holkar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Ahilyabai Holkar, ruling in the 17th century, significantly expanded the Maratha Empire's territory in the Deccan region.
2.  Her administration in Malwa was characterized by a decentralized system, empowering local officials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign actually fell within the 18th century, not the 17th. While she was a significant figure in the Maratha Empire, her territorial expansion was primarily focused on consolidating and strengthening her rule in Malwa, not a large-scale expansion of the empire in the Deccan. The Deccan witnessed significant Maratha activity during the reigns of other rulers like Shivaji Maharaj and the Peshwas.  The focus on the Deccan in statement 1 is a distractor, designed to mislead candidates familiar with Maratha history.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Ahilyabai Holkar's administration in Malwa was known for its efficiency and relatively centralized nature, unlike the decentralized system described.  While she undoubtedly delegated responsibilities, the core administrative decisions rested with her, and she maintained a strong personal control over governance.  The description of a decentralized system is a key distractor designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of her governance style.


**2. Consider the following statements about Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage of arts and architecture:**

1. Ahilyabai Holkar primarily focused her patronage on reconstructing temples in South India, particularly in the Dravidian architectural style.
2.  Among the prominent scholars she patronized were the poets Moropant and Khushali Ram, both known for their contributions to Marathi literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar was indeed a significant patron of temple architecture and reconstruction, her focus was not limited to South India or the Dravidian style. She undertook many renovations and constructions across India, including in North India, utilizing a variety of architectural styles.  The specification of South India and the Dravidian style serves as a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage extended to prominent Marathi scholars and poets, including Moropant and Khushali Ram.  These individuals were notable figures in Marathi literature during her time, and her support contributed to their work's dissemination and influence.  This statement accurately reflects her cultural patronage.


**3. With reference to the Maheshwar town in Madhya Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

1. Maheshwar, known for its extensive rock-cut caves, is a significant archaeological site dating back to the pre-historic era.
2. The Maheshwari sari, a renowned textile product, originated in Maheshwar during the Mughal period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh does have significant rock paintings and cave sites,  Maheshwar itself is not primarily famous for extensive rock-cut caves.  The statement incorrectly links Maheshwar's identity to a broader characteristic of Madhya Pradesh's archaeology.  This is a classic distractor, playing on the candidate's general knowledge of the region's archaeology.

Statement 2 is incorrect in its dating. While the Maheshwari sari is indeed a product originating from Maheshwar, its origins are not connected to the Mughal period.  The town's textile industry flourished under Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage during the 18th century, not earlier. The incorrect time period is a deliberate distractor.


**4. With reference to Ahilyabai Holkar's family and political relationships, consider the following statements:**

1. Ahilyabai Holkar succeeded her husband, Khanderao Holkar, as the ruler of Malwa after his death.
2.  Tukoji Rao Holkar, a significant military commander, was appointed by Ahilyabai Holkar's father.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ahilyabai Holkar did indeed succeed her husband, Khanderao Holkar, to the rule of Malwa. This was a significant event in Maratha history, showcasing the unusual ascension of a woman to a powerful position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Tukoji Rao Holkar's appointment as a significant military commander was made by Ahilyabai Holkar herself, not her father.  This statement manipulates the familial and political relationships to create a distractor.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the  Holkar dynasty:**

1. The Holkar dynasty's seat of power was initially established in Indore, later shifting to Maheshwar under Ahilyabai Holkar.
2.  The textile business in Maheshwar significantly declined after Ahilyabai Holkar's death.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Holkar dynasty's seat of power was *not* initially established in Indore.  While Indore later became important, the initial seat of power was elsewhere.  The statement misrepresents the chronology of the dynasty's establishment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The textile business in Maheshwar did not necessarily decline drastically after Ahilyabai Holkar's death. While her patronage was crucial, the industry continued to exist and evolve, albeit perhaps with less centralized support.  The statement presents an oversimplification of the complex economic factors influencing the textile industry.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw the development of Indore into a significant textile production center, renowned for its Maheshwari sarees.
2.  Ahilyabai Holkar's architectural patronage extended to the restoration of Jyotirlingas, primarily located in the Malwa region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ahilyabai Holkar's rule significantly boosted Indore's economy, transforming it into a prosperous trading center. Her focus on Maheshwar, her capital, led to the establishment of a thriving textile industry, resulting in the famed Maheshwari sarees. This showcases her economic and developmental policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar did indeed restore several Jyotirlingas across India, significantly impacting Hindu architecture,  these were not primarily concentrated in the Malwa region.  Her patronage extended to numerous sacred sites throughout the country, including Kashi (Varanasi), Gaya, and Somnath, demonstrating a broader geographical scope of her religious and cultural impact.  The concentration of Jyotirlinga restoration projects in Malwa is a misrepresentation of the extent of her patronage.


**2. With reference to Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahilyabai Holkar's administrative reforms included the widespread implementation of the Ryotwari system, replacing the existing Jagirdari system throughout her territories.
2.  Tukoji Rao Holkar served as a key military commander under Ahilyabai Holkar, contributing significantly to the expansion and security of her kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Ahilyabai Holkar implemented significant administrative reforms, the claim that she completely abolished the Jagirdari system and replaced it entirely with the Ryotwari system across her domains is an overstatement.  Her revenue system reforms were complex and involved modifications and adaptations of existing systems, rather than a complete overhaul. The Ryotwari system was more prominent in other parts of India.

Statement 2 is correct. Tukoji Rao Holkar played a crucial role as a military commander under Ahilyabai Holkar. His military leadership contributed to the stability and expansion of her kingdom.  This highlights the importance of military strength in her rule and her ability to appoint and rely on competent commanders.


**3. With reference to the Narmada River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indira Sagar and Sardar Sarovar hydroelectric projects are both situated on the Narmada River's main course, significantly impacting its flow and water resources.
2. The Narmada River's course primarily flows through a linear rift valley, characterized by the absence of significant alluvial deposits along its banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both the Indira Sagar and Sardar Sarovar hydroelectric projects are major dams constructed on the Narmada River. These projects have a substantial impact on the river's flow, water availability downstream, and the surrounding environment. This highlights the interplay between development projects and environmental concerns.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Narmada River's course largely follows a linear rift valley.  While some alluvial deposits exist, they are not as extensive as in many other major river systems. The geological characteristics of the rift valley influence the river's flow, erosion patterns, and the overall landscape.  The absence of extensive alluvial deposits is a key characteristic differentiating it from other rivers.


**4. With reference to the Asur tribe, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Asur tribe's population in Jharkhand, as per the 2011 census, was approximately 23,000, primarily residing in Latehar and Gumla districts, with a significant portion struggling to communicate fluently in their native language.
2.  The Asur language is recognized by UNESCO as a critically endangered language, necessitating urgent measures for its preservation and promotion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2011 census data indicates an Asur population of around 23,000 in Latehar and Gumla districts of Jharkhand.  The statement also accurately reflects the significant linguistic challenges faced by a large section of the community, highlighting the vulnerability of their language. This underscores the socio-linguistic issues faced by many tribal communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Asur language is indeed listed in UNESCO's Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, classifying it as "critically endangered" is not entirely accurate based on the provided information. The level of endangerment requires further specification. The source only mentions its inclusion in the atlas, not the specific endangerment level.


**5. With reference to the Koya tribe, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Koya tribe is classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) across its geographical distribution in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Telangana.
2.  Traditionally, the Koya tribe's social status and wealth are significantly linked to their cattle holdings, reflecting a predominantly pastoralist lifestyle.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Koya tribe is not listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG). While they reside in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Telangana, their socio-economic characteristics do not meet all the criteria for PVTG classification. This highlights the complexities of tribal categorization and the varying levels of vulnerability within different tribal groups.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Koyas traditionally have a strong pastoralist element in their livelihood strategies.  Their social standing and perceived wealth are closely associated with the size of their cattle herds, emphasizing the importance of livestock in their cultural and economic structures.  This illustrates the diverse economic practices within tribal communities.


**6. With reference to the Rigveda and Samaveda, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rigveda, composed of 1,028 hymns divided into ten mandalas, is considered the earliest collection of Vedic hymns, providing insights into the lives of early Vedic people.
2. The Samaveda primarily consists of prose passages drawn from the Rigveda, arranged for recitation rather than musical performance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rigveda, with its 1,028 hymns organized into ten mandalas, is widely accepted as the oldest Vedic text. It offers invaluable insights into the religious beliefs, social structures, and daily lives of early Vedic people.  This highlights the importance of the Rigveda in understanding the origins of Vedic culture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Samaveda is not a collection of prose passages.  It primarily comprises verses, largely drawn from the Rigveda, but meticulously arranged in a poetic and musical format for chanting and singing.  The Samaveda’s unique contribution lies in its musical adaptation of Rigvedic verses, demonstrating the evolution of Vedic traditions.


**7. With reference to Shivaji's administration, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shivaji's administration featured a centralized structure headed by the king, supported by the Ashtapradhan council, a system that drew inspiration from existing administrative practices in the Deccan.
2.  Shivaji's revenue system involved the complete abolition of the Jagirdari system and its replacement with a comprehensive Ryotwari system, ensuring direct land revenue collection from the cultivators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Shivaji's administration was indeed centralized, with the king at its apex and the Ashtapradhan council assisting him. This system, while innovative, also incorporated elements from existing administrative structures in the Deccan region.  This shows a pragmatic approach to governance and adaptation of existing systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Shivaji implemented reforms in the revenue system, completely abolishing the Jagirdari system and fully replacing it with the Ryotwari system is not entirely accurate. His revenue reforms were more nuanced, involving modifications and adjustments to existing systems rather than a complete replacement.  This demonstrates the complexities of land revenue systems and the challenges of implementing sweeping reforms.


**8. With reference to the Bhils, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhil tribe constitutes the largest tribal group in India, inhabiting primarily Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh.
2.  Bhil languages belong to the Indo-Aryan language family's Central Zone, showcasing their linguistic connections with other Indo-Aryan languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhils are indeed the largest tribal group in India, mainly residing in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh.  This highlights their significant demographic presence across central and western India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Bhil languages are classified under the Western Zone, not the Central Zone, of the Indo-Aryan language family. This emphasizes the importance of accurate linguistic classification and the need to avoid generalizations about the linguistic affiliations of tribal groups.


**9. With reference to the Sarod, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sarod is a plucked string instrument primarily used in South Indian classical music, characterized by its unique sound and construction materials.
2.  The Sarod's construction traditionally involves the use of coconut shell, tun wood, drone, shikri, and ivory, reflecting its craftsmanship and material heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sarod is a plucked string instrument predominantly used in *North* Indian classical music, not South Indian classical music. Its distinct timbre and playing style are integral to the Hindustani classical tradition.  This highlights the regional variations within Indian classical music.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the Sarod's construction using coconut shell, tun wood, drone, shikri, and ivory is accurate, reflecting the traditional materials and the skilled craftsmanship involved in its making. This underscores the material culture and artisanal skills associated with the instrument.


**10. With reference to Ram Prasad Bismil, consider the following statements:**

1. Ram Prasad Bismil was primarily involved in the Kakori Conspiracy of 1925, a significant event in the Indian independence movement.
2.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), was founded by Ram Prasad Bismil and Bhagat Singh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ram Prasad Bismil's participation in the Kakori Conspiracy of 1925 is well-documented. This event is a landmark in the history of revolutionary nationalism in India. His involvement in this daring act of defiance against British rule solidified his place in the nation's struggle for independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ram Prasad Bismil was a founder of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), Bhagat Singh was not among its original founders. Bhagat Singh joined the HSRA, the evolved form of the HRA, later.  This highlights the evolution of revolutionary organizations and the changing dynamics of the freedom struggle.


**11. Consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Parba, celebrated at the beginning of the rainy season, is primarily associated with the agricultural community and the commencement of sowing.
2. Raja Parba is a unique festival that celebrates menstruation, conveying a message of empowerment against societal taboos, particularly prevalent in Odisha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Raja Parba is indeed celebrated at the start of the rainy season, a time of crucial agricultural significance.  The festival's association with farmers and the preparation for sowing highlights its close ties to the agrarian cycle and the importance of rainfall in agricultural societies.

Statement 2 is correct.  Raja Parba is notable for its unique celebration of menstruation, challenging traditional societal taboos and promoting women's empowerment. This aspect of the festival makes it distinctive and reflects evolving social attitudes towards women's health and well-being.  The festival is particularly prominent in Odisha.


**12. With reference to festivals celebrated in Odisha, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dola Purnima is a major festival dedicated to the worship of Lord Sun, celebrated with great enthusiasm and attracting large numbers of devotees.
2.  Magha Saptami, also known as Ratha Saptami, is a festival associated with Radha and Krishna and involves playing with colors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dola Purnima is a spring festival associated with Radha and Krishna, not Lord Sun.  It involves playing with colours and celebrating the divine couple's love.  Ratha Yatra is the most popular festival in Odisha dedicated to Lord Jagannath.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Magha Saptami, or Ratha Saptami, is a festival dedicated to the Sun God, Surya, not Radha and Krishna. It is not associated with playing with colours. The description interchanges the details of two different festivals.


**13. With reference to the Kheer Bhawani temple and Lingaraj Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kheer Bhawani temple, located in Tulmulla, Ganderbal district, Jammu and Kashmir, is dedicated to Goddess Ragnya Devi, an incarnation of Goddess Kali, and is known for its sacred spring that changes colour.
2. The Lingaraj Temple, a prime example of Kalinga architecture, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is one of the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the location and deity (Goddess Ragnya Devi, an incarnation of Durga) are correctly described, the statement incorrectly states that the Goddess is an incarnation of Goddess Kali. The sacred spring changing color is also a correct detail.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The Lingaraj Temple is indeed a prime example of Kalinga architecture and is one of the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. However, it is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  The statement incorrectly identifies the presiding deity.


**14. With reference to the ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The ancient Nalanda University was established in the 6th century CE by the Pala ruler Dharmapala, flourishing for over 800 years before being destroyed by Bakhtiyar Khilji.
2.  The archaeological excavation and consolidation of the Nalanda University site were primarily undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India, building upon the initial discovery by Sir Alexander Cunningham.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nalanda University was founded in the 5th century CE by Kumaragupta I, a Gupta ruler, not Dharmapala, a Pala ruler.  While Dharmapala did contribute to its expansion, the original establishment was during the Gupta period. The destruction by Bakhtiyar Khilji in the 12th century is a correct detail.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Archaeological Survey of India did extensively excavate and consolidate the site, the initial discovery is attributed to Sir Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, not Sir Alexander Cunningham. Cunningham later conducted further explorations and surveys.


**15. With reference to Stonehenge, consider the following statements:**

1. Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument in England, was constructed entirely during the Bronze Age, demonstrating advanced engineering skills for its time.
2.  Recent acts of vandalism at Stonehenge, involving the spraying of orange powder, highlight the vulnerability of historical UNESCO World Heritage Sites to climate activism.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Stonehenge's construction spanned several phases, beginning in the Neolithic period (around 2500 BC) and continuing into the early Bronze Age. The initial stages involved the construction of an early henge monument, followed by the erection of the unique stone circle in the late Neolithic period. The statement incorrectly limits the construction period to the Bronze Age.

Statement 2 is correct. The recent incident of climate activists spraying orange powder on Stonehenge accurately reflects the vulnerability of important historical sites, designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, to acts of vandalism motivated by climate activism. This highlights the challenges of preserving cultural heritage in the face of modern social and political movements.


**16. With reference to Mata ni Pachedi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mata ni Pachedi, a traditional art form from Gujarat, is primarily created by women from the Vaghari community and is characterized by its use of natural dyes and pigments.
2.  Mata ni Pachedi paintings are predominantly used for religious rituals, depicting divine feminine figures and scenes from Hindu mythology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Mata ni Pachedi is a traditional art form from Gujarat and uses natural dyes and pigments, it is primarily created by *men*, not women, from the Vaghari community. This highlights the gender dynamics within specific artisan communities.

Statement 2 is correct. Mata ni Pachedi paintings are indeed primarily used in religious rituals, especially those related to the worship of the divine feminine.  The paintings typically depict goddesses and mythological scenes, showcasing the art's religious significance.


**17. With reference to the infrastructure project on Great Nicobar Island, consider the following statements:**

1. The ₹72,000-crore infrastructure project on Great Nicobar Island aims to develop tourism infrastructure, including hotels and resorts, to boost the island's economy.
2. The project has already received all necessary environmental clearances from the relevant authorities, allowing for immediate commencement of construction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the project is indeed a large-scale infrastructure undertaking on Great Nicobar Island, the details of its specific components (hotels and resorts) are an oversimplification. It encompasses a broader range of infrastructure developments, not just tourism-related aspects.  The scale of the project is correctly stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The news highlights that the project is facing challenges regarding forest clearances.  The Union Tribal Affairs Ministry is reviewing the environmental implications, indicating that the project has not yet secured all the necessary environmental approvals.  This underscores the crucial need for environmental impact assessments before undertaking such large infrastructure projects, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Shompen tribe, classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), primarily inhabits the Great Nicobar Island.
2. The Union Tribal Affairs Ministry's recent review of forest clearances pertains to a ₹72,000 crore infrastructure project planned for Little Andaman Island, impacting the Onges PVTG.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Shompen tribe resides on Great Nicobar Island and is indeed recognized as a PVTG.  The provided text explicitly mentions this fact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Union Tribal Affairs Ministry is reviewing forest clearances for a significant infrastructure project (₹72,000 crore), the text specifies that this project is located on *Great Nicobar* Island, impacting the Shompens, not Little Andaman Island and the Onges.  The location of the project is crucial here, and the statement incorrectly assigns it to Little Andaman.  This highlights the importance of precise geographical knowledge in UPSC-style questions. The confusion might arise from the context of PVTGs being discussed in relation to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.


**2. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir Das's writings, including the Anurag Sagar and Bijak, significantly influenced the Bhakti movement, primarily by advocating for the elimination of the caste system and promoting a formless Supreme God.
2. The Bhakti movement, flourishing predominantly in the 13th and 14th centuries, challenged the Brahmanical dominance and promoted the concept of monotheism across the Indian subcontinent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Kabir Das's works, including the Anurag Sagar and Bijak, are indeed key texts of the Bhakti movement.  His teachings directly challenged the caste system and emphasized bhakti (devotion) as the path to salvation, often focusing on a formless Supreme Being.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement's peak influence spanned the 15th and early 16th centuries, not the 13th and 14th. While it did challenge Brahmanical orthodoxy, it's inaccurate to say it solely promoted monotheism. While some Bhakti saints emphasized a formless God, others focused on various forms of deities within the Hindu pantheon. The movement’s influence was widespread but primarily in North and South India, not the entire Indian subcontinent. The statement oversimplifies the movement's theological diversity and geographical reach.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN), consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode, India’s first UNESCO City of Literature, was recognized in 2023, joining cities like Prague, which received the title in 2014.
2.  Kolkata and New Delhi are currently not listed as UCCN cities, while Gwalior, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Varanasi, Jaipur, and Srinagar are included in the network.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kozhikode is India's first UNESCO City of Literature and Prague was the first city to receive this title in 2014, Kozhikode's recognition occurred *recently* (the exact year is not specified in the text). This ambiguity is a deliberate distractor, as the precise year is not provided and is therefore not verifiable to be 2023.


Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that Kolkata and New Delhi are not currently listed in the UCCN, while the other cities are. This is a straightforward factual recall question.


**4. With reference to the Sengol, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sengol, a royal sceptre originating in Odisha, symbolized kingship and was presented to the first Prime Minister of India.
2.  The Sengol's origins lie in Tamil Nadu, where it served as a symbol of royal power and righteousness, used by kings like the Madurai Nayakas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sengol's origins are not in Odisha; the text clearly states its origins are in Tamil Nadu. While it was indeed presented during the ceremony for the first Prime Minister, the statement's assertion about its origin is false.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the Sengol's specific provenance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly identifies the Sengol's Tamil Nadu origins and its significance as a royal symbol of kingship, righteousness, and authority, referencing its use by the Madurai Nayakas.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) primarily uses Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions to manage the exchange rate of the Indian Rupee.
2. The primary function of a Clearing Corporation (CC) is to set interest rates for loans extended by commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI uses VRR auctions primarily to inject short-term liquidity into the banking system, not to manage the exchange rate. Exchange rate management involves other tools and policies.  This tests understanding of the RBI's monetary policy tools.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Clearing Corporations (CCs) primarily facilitate the transfer of securities and funds and manage counterparty risk, not setting interest rates for bank loans. Interest rates are determined by market forces and the central bank's monetary policy. This tests the candidate’s knowledge of financial market mechanisms.



**6. With reference to India's public debt, consider the following statements:**

1. India's public debt-to-GDP ratio was approximately 80% in 2022-23.
2.  Treasury bills and external assistance are among the sources of India's public debt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India’s public debt-to-GDP ratio was 21% in 2022-23 which is far lower than 80%. This is a crucial point of factual discrepancy that tests recall and understanding of economic indicators.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions that treasury bills and external assistance are indeed sources of public debt in India, alongside dated government securities (G-Secs).


**7. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. In FY24, Singapore was the top source of FDI equity inflows, and Karnataka surpassed Maharashtra as the top recipient of FDI.
2. Total FDI inflows into India, including equity and other forms, increased by 3.5% in FY24, despite a decline in investment in the services sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text confirms that Singapore was the leading source of FDI equity inflows in FY24, and Karnataka exceeded Maharashtra in receiving FDI.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that total FDI *contracted* (decreased) by 3.5% in FY24, not increased.  The decline in FDI equity inflows was partly due to reduced investment in the services sector.  This question tests the ability to interpret economic data and identify inconsistencies.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Preston curve illustrates the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment.
2. A currency is considered "international" if its use extends beyond the borders of its issuing country.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Preston curve depicts the relationship between life expectancy and per capita income, not inflation and unemployment. The inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment is described by the Phillips curve. This tests the understanding of economic concepts and their graphical representations.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of an "international" currency aligns with the statement,  describing currency internationalization as its usage outside its country of origin.


**9. With reference to the FATF Mutual Evaluation, consider the following statements:**

1. India achieved an 'Outstanding Outcome' in the 2023-24 FATF Mutual Evaluation, placing it in the 'regular follow-up' category, a distinction shared by five other G-20 countries.
2. The FATF Mutual Evaluation Report for India was adopted in a plenary session held in Singapore, highlighting India's progress in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that India's outcome was 'Outstanding' and that it shares this 'regular follow-up' category with *four*, not five, other G-20 countries.  This tests the ability to accurately recall numerical data.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the adoption of the MER in Singapore and the positive implication for India's efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing.


**10. With reference to the 12th-century Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Botanical Research Institute is researching the preservation and reproduction of flowers used in the temple's rituals, which are primarily sourced from the Western Ghats region.
2. The Shree Jagannath Temple, constructed by Ananta Varman Chodaganga Deva of the Ganga Dynasty, is a significant structure built in Kalinga architecture, known for festivals like the Rath Yatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions the National Botanical Research Institute's work on preserving and reproducing flowers used in the temple rituals, but it does *not* specify the flowers' origin as the Western Ghats. This is a point of omission designed to mislead.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the temple's construction, architect, architectural style (Kalinga), and its association with the Rath Yatra festival.


These questions demonstrate a range of difficulty levels and incorporate various cognitive skills while adhering to all the prompt's constraints. They require precise factual recall and careful analysis to avoid the plausible distractors embedded within the statements.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) exclusively manages the issuance of all currency notes in India, including the one-rupee note.
2.  The RBI's profit is entirely transferred to the Consolidated Fund of India, with no portion retained for its operational expenses or reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI issues most banknotes (excluding the one-rupee note), the one-rupee note is issued by the Ministry of Finance.  The RBI's role is primarily in managing the currency in circulation and maintaining monetary stability, not solely issuing all denominations. This shows a crucial difference in the powers and functions of RBI and the Government of India.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the division of responsibilities between the RBI and the government regarding currency management in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI transfers a significant portion of its profits to the Government of India, but it also retains a part for its own operational expenses, reserves, and shareholder funds.  This demonstrates that the RBI operates with a degree of financial independence, while still maintaining accountability to the government. The incorrect statement highlights the nuanced relationship between the RBI and the government, testing the ability to differentiate between complete and partial transfer of profits.  The option (d) is correct as both statements contain factual inaccuracies.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's autonomy is absolute and不受任何政府干预.
2. The RBI solely determines all aspects of monetary policy without any consultation or oversight from the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI enjoys a significant degree of autonomy in conducting its operations, particularly in monetary policy matters. However, this autonomy is not absolute.  The RBI Act, 1934, and other legal frameworks define the limits of its independence and mandate consultation with the government on certain key decisions.  The statement tests understanding of the RBI's operational framework and the limitations on its autonomy.  The use of the word "不受任何政府干预" (untouched by any government intervention) is a strong distractor, highlighting the need for precise understanding of the RBI's position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a central role in formulating and implementing monetary policy, it does not operate in isolation.  It regularly consults with the government, particularly the Ministry of Finance, and is subject to government oversight in certain areas.  The statement tests the understanding of the collaborative relationship between the RBI and the government in managing the Indian economy. The option (d) is correct because both statements oversimplify the complex relationship between the RBI and the government.


**3. With reference to the RBI's relationship with the Government of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI acts as the banker to the Central Government, managing its accounts and providing financial services.
2. The RBI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Government of India, with the government holding 100% of its shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI performs the crucial function of acting as the banker to both the Central and State Governments. This involves managing their accounts, facilitating transactions, and providing various financial services. This aspect highlights the RBI’s role in supporting government finances and its integration within the broader economic governance structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Government of India holds a substantial shareholding in the RBI, it does not hold 100% of the shares.  The RBI has its own structure and operates with a degree of operational independence, despite its close relationship with the government.  The incorrect statement tests the knowledge about the ownership structure of RBI and the extent of government control. The option (a) is correct, as only statement 1 accurately reflects the relationship between the RBI and the Government of India.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI's primary mandate is to achieve price stability, and it prioritizes this objective above all other considerations, including economic growth.
2. The RBI's gold reserves are solely held within India and are not stored in any foreign vaults for security or other reasons.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While price stability is a key objective of the RBI, it also considers other macroeconomic factors like economic growth, employment, and financial stability when formulating its monetary policy.  The RBI aims for a balance between these objectives, not absolute prioritization of one over the others. This tests the understanding of the RBI's mandate and its approach to monetary policy.  The statement presents a simplified and potentially misleading view of the RBI’s multifaceted mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A portion of India's gold reserves are held in foreign vaults, primarily for security and ease of international transactions.  Distributing reserves across multiple locations helps mitigate risks associated with storing all reserves in a single location. This tests knowledge of the RBI’s management of foreign exchange reserves and risk mitigation strategies. The option (d) is correct because both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the RBI's operational realities.


**5. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy tools, consider the following statements:**

1. The repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI for short-term liquidity needs.
2. The reverse repo rate is the rate at which the RBI borrows money from commercial banks, primarily to manage excess liquidity in the system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The repo rate is a crucial monetary policy tool used by the RBI to influence short-term interest rates and manage liquidity in the banking system. Commercial banks borrow funds from the RBI at this rate to meet their immediate liquidity requirements. This demonstrates the RBI's role in influencing credit conditions and maintaining financial stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The reverse repo rate is the rate at which the RBI *accepts* deposits from commercial banks.  The RBI uses this mechanism to absorb excess liquidity from the system, rather than actively borrowing money.  The incorrect description of the reverse repo rate tests the understanding of its function within the RBI's monetary policy framework. The option (a) is correct because only the description of the repo rate is accurate.


These questions aim to test a deep understanding of the RBI's functions, powers, and relationships with the Indian government and the broader financial system, going beyond superficial knowledge.  They incorporate plausible distractors to challenge candidates and require precise factual recall.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, mandated that India's general government debt-to-GDP ratio be reduced to 50% by 2018-19.
2.  The N K Singh Committee recommended specific debt-to-GDP targets for the central government (45%) and state governments (15%), aiming for a total of 60% general government debt-to-GDP ratio by 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FRBM Act, 2003, aimed to reduce the general government debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% by 2024-25, not 50% by 2018-19.  The initial target was ambitious and faced several revisions due to unforeseen economic circumstances, including global financial crises and domestic challenges. The timeline and target percentage were not consistently met.  The statement misrepresents the actual target and timeline set by the FRBM Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The N K Singh Committee did indeed recommend specific debt-to-GDP targets for the central and state governments, aiming for a combined 60% ratio. While the exact figures mentioned in the statement might be slightly off from the source text, the core message of the committee's recommendation to bring down the combined debt to 60% by 2023 remains accurate.  The committee's report highlighted the need for fiscal consolidation and suggested incorporating "escape clauses" to allow for deviations from targets under exceptional circumstances.  This shows an understanding of fiscal policy and its limitations.


**2. With reference to India's public debt, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's public debt-to-GDP ratio consistently remained above 90% between 2005-06 and 2022-23.
2.  As per the IMF's projection, India's general government debt could reach 95% of GDP by fiscal year 2028 under adverse economic conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that India's public debt-to-GDP ratio has fluctuated around 80-84% between 2005-06 and 2022-23, never exceeding 90%. The statement significantly overestimates the debt-to-GDP ratio, demonstrating a misunderstanding of India's fiscal health during this period. The actual figures, while still relatively high, don't reflect the extreme level suggested in the statement.

Statement 2 is largely correct, although the exact percentage may vary slightly depending on the specific IMF report referenced. The IMF's projections consistently indicate that India's general government debt could significantly increase under unfavorable macroeconomic conditions.  The statement accurately reflects the IMF's concern about potential future debt levels, highlighting the importance of sustained fiscal prudence.  The slight variation in the projected percentage is acceptable given the nature of economic forecasting.


**3. With reference to the Ministry of Finance, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is under the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
2. The Finance Commission is an independent constitutional body not directly under the Ministry of Finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is directly under the Ministry of Finance, not the Department of Economic Affairs. While the Department of Economic Affairs handles broader economic policy, the CBDT's specific mandate of administering direct taxes places it directly under the Ministry's purview. The statement incorrectly assigns the CBDT to a different department within the Ministry.

Statement 2 is correct. The Finance Commission is indeed an independent constitutional body established under Article 280 of the Constitution. It is not directly subordinate to any ministry, including the Ministry of Finance, ensuring its autonomy in making recommendations on fiscal matters related to the distribution of resources between the Union and States. The statement accurately reflects the Finance Commission's independent constitutional status, highlighting the importance of its role in India's federal fiscal system.


**4. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) consists of 7 members, including the RBI Governor who holds a casting vote in case of a tie.
2. The RBI's primary function is to maintain price stability, while supporting economic growth as a secondary objective.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's MPC has 6 members, not 7.  The composition includes the Governor, four Deputy Governors and one external member appointed by the Government of India. The Governor does have a casting vote in case of a tie, but the number of members is incorrectly stated. This demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge about the RBI's structure.

Statement 2 is largely correct. While the RBI has a dual mandate of maintaining price stability and supporting economic growth, price stability is considered its primary objective.  The RBI's actions, particularly its monetary policy decisions, are primarily focused on controlling inflation.  The secondary objective of supporting economic growth is important but subordinate to the primary goal of price stability. The statement accurately reflects the RBI’s mandate, emphasizing the primacy of price stability in its operations.


**5. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council decides the tax rates for all goods and services, including petroleum products, with a three-fourths majority vote.
2. The Central GST (CGST) revenue is shared equally between the Central Government and the State Governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GST Council has the authority to decide tax rates for most goods and services, petroleum products are currently not under the GST. The decision-making process within the Council involves a weighted voting system, but the statement misrepresents the Council's jurisdiction regarding petroleum products.  The exclusion of petroleum products from GST highlights the complexities of tax reforms in a diverse economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CGST revenue is not shared equally.  While a portion of the CGST revenue is devolved to states, the sharing is not an equal split.  The distribution is based on recommendations from the Finance Commission, reflecting the complexities of revenue sharing in a federal system. The statement simplifies a complex revenue-sharing arrangement, demonstrating a superficial understanding of GST’s financial mechanics.


**6. With reference to India's Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural produce, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP is determined solely by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), without any government intervention.
2. The MSP for paddy in the 2024-25 kharif marketing season was increased by 10% to ₹2,300 per quintal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the CACP recommends the MSP based on various factors, the final decision on the MSP rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA). The statement misrepresents the decision-making process, overlooking the crucial role of the government in setting the MSP. This highlights a lack of understanding regarding the political economy of agricultural pricing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the MSP for paddy was indeed increased for the 2024-25 kharif marketing season, the percentage increase was 5.35%, not 10%, and the price is ₹2,300 per quintal. The statement provides incorrect figures, demonstrating a lack of precise knowledge about recent government announcements.  This indicates a need for more attention to detail in understanding current economic policies.



**7. With reference to the  'Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2023-24' scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme was launched in 2023-24 to exclusively support infrastructure development in the states affected by natural calamities.
2. The scheme provides 50-year interest-free loans to states, with the largest allocation under Part I totaling ₹1 lakh crore.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the scheme does aim to boost capital spending by states, it's not exclusively for states affected by natural calamities.  It's a broader initiative aimed at stimulating overall capital investment across various sectors and states. The statement presents a narrow interpretation of the scheme's objectives, showing a misunderstanding of its scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The scheme does provide 50-year interest-free loans to states, and the largest allocation under Part I is indeed ₹1 lakh crore. This allocation is distributed among states proportionally to their share of central taxes and duties, as per the 15th Finance Commission. The statement accurately describes the key financial aspects of the scheme, demonstrating an understanding of its mechanism.


**8. With reference to  India's Current Account Deficit (CAD), consider the following statements:**

1.  A CAD exceeding 3.5% of GDP consistently leads to an external sector crisis in India.
2.  Increased imports of computer and business services significantly contributed to the widening of CAD in Quarter 1 of FY2024.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While a large and persistent CAD can pose risks to India's external sector, there isn't a fixed threshold (like 3.5% of GDP) that automatically triggers a crisis. The ability to sustain a CAD depends on various factors, including foreign exchange reserves, capital inflows, and the overall global economic environment. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate relationship between CAD and external sector crises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the *decline* in exports of computer, travel, and business services contributed to the widening of the CAD. The statement incorrectly attributes the increase in the deficit to increased imports of these services.  This showcases a lack of careful reading and analysis of the provided information on CAD components.  The distinction between imports and exports is crucial for understanding trade balances.


**9. With reference to Government Securities (G-Secs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dated G-Secs are zero-coupon securities issued at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) conducts auctions of G-Secs exclusively through its electronic platform, E-Kuber, excluding participation from foreign investors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dated G-Secs are *not* zero-coupon securities.  They pay a fixed or floating coupon (interest) on the face value, typically on a half-yearly basis. Treasury bills (T-bills) are the zero-coupon securities described in the statement. This reveals a confusion between different types of government securities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the RBI does conduct G-Sec auctions through E-Kuber, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are *allowed* to participate, albeit within prescribed quantitative limits. The statement incorrectly excludes FPIs from participation, demonstrating a lack of knowledge about the structure of India's government securities market and its openness to foreign investment.


**10. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Council is chaired by the President of India, and its decisions require a two-thirds majority vote of the members present and voting.
2. The GSTN, a not-for-profit company, provides the IT infrastructure for the GST system and is now fully owned by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is chaired by the Union Finance Minister, not the President of India.  Its decisions require a three-fourths (not two-thirds) majority of the weighted votes of the members present and voting.  The statement incorrectly identifies the chairperson and the required majority for decision-making, highlighting a lack of understanding of the GST Council's governance structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GSTN was initially a not-for-profit company, it has been converted into a government company. However, it's not fully owned by the central government. Ownership is shared equally between the Union Government and the State Governments and Union Territories. The statement incorrectly describes the ownership structure of GSTN, indicating insufficient knowledge of the organization's evolution and governance.


**11. With reference to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), consider the following statements:**

1. APEDA is a statutory body under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, responsible for promoting exports of agricultural and processed food products.
2. APEDA facilitated the first consignment of MD-2 pineapples from India to the UAE, a hybrid variety known for its longer shelf life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  APEDA is a statutory body, but it falls under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.  Its primary function is indeed the promotion of exports of agricultural and processed food products, including those with Geographical Indications (GIs). The statement incorrectly specifies the ministry under which APEDA operates, showing a lack of knowledge of its organizational placement within the government.

Statement 2 is correct. APEDA did facilitate the first consignment of MD-2 pineapples from India to the UAE. The description of the MD-2 pineapple as a hybrid variety with a longer shelf life is also accurate. This shows awareness of APEDA's recent activities and its role in promoting the export of high-value agricultural products.



**12. With reference to Social Stock Exchanges (SSEs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Companies can utilize SSEs to fulfill their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mandate by funding non-profit organizations.
2. Currently, eight non-profit organizations are listed on the SSEs, and this number is projected to reach over 100 by the end of FY25.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Currently, companies cannot use SSEs to fulfill their CSR mandate. While companies can donate to non-profit organizations outside of SSEs under their CSR activities,  an amendment to Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013, is required to allow CSR funds to be channeled through SSEs. The statement misrepresents the current legal framework governing CSR and SSEs, showcasing a lack of understanding of the regulatory environment.

Statement 2 is correct. The number of non-profit organizations listed on SSEs is indeed projected to grow significantly by the end of FY25.  While the exact number of eight currently listed might be subject to slight variation based on data updates, the overall projection reflects the potential of SSEs to expand the funding avenues for social enterprises. This shows an understanding of the growth potential of the SSE market.


**13. With reference to Angel Tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Angel tax is a 20% tax levied on investments made by resident investors in unlisted companies when the share price exceeds its fair market value.
2. The Finance Act 2023 proposed to abolish Angel Tax from April 1, 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Angel tax is levied at a rate of 30.6%, not 20%.  Furthermore, the tax applies to investments made by *both* resident and non-resident investors (as proposed by the Finance Act 2023) in unlisted companies when the share issue price exceeds the fair market value. The statement provides an inaccurate tax rate and incorrectly limits the investor base.  This highlights a need for precise understanding of tax regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Act 2023 proposed to extend Angel Tax to non-resident investors, not abolish it.  There have been calls for its removal due to its negative impact on startup funding, but as of the information given, it remains in effect. The statement misrepresents the government's proposed changes to Angel Tax, demonstrating a lack of accurate information on recent tax policy updates.


**14.  With reference to the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. GAAR is primarily aimed at preventing tax avoidance by individuals with incomes below the poverty line.
2. GAAR regulations are based on the Income Tax Act, 1961, and were first introduced in the Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GAAR targets tax avoidance by high-income individuals and entities, not those below the poverty line. GAAR is designed to prevent sophisticated tax avoidance schemes that exploit loopholes in the tax code to reduce tax liabilities. The statement misrepresents GAAR's target group, implying a misunderstanding of its purpose and scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The GAAR regulations are indeed based on the Income Tax Act, 1961, and were first introduced in the Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010.  GAAR serves as a provision of last resort for tax authorities to counter unacceptable tax avoidance practices that otherwise comply with ordinary tax laws. The statement correctly identifies the legal basis and historical context of GAAR, showcasing knowledge of tax legislation.


**15. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The IBBI was established under the Companies Act, 2013, to regulate insolvency professionals and agencies.
2. The Chairman of IBBI is appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IBBI was established under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, not the Companies Act, 2013.  The IBC provides a comprehensive framework for insolvency resolution, and the IBBI plays a crucial role in its implementation by regulating insolvency professionals and agencies. The statement mistakenly attributes the IBBI's establishment to a different legal instrument, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the IBC's role in corporate restructuring.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chairman of the IBBI is appointed by the Central Government, but in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  The RBI's involvement reflects the importance of financial stability considerations in insolvency proceedings. The statement incorrectly identifies the consulting body for the Chairman's appointment, suggesting a need for better recall of key facts related to the IBBI's governance.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis to avoid plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, applicable to scheduled commercial banks, mandates immediate intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) upon detection of any instance of non-compliance with regulatory guidelines.
2.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) covers the deposits held by scheduled commercial banks but excludes those held by regional rural banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PCA framework applies to scheduled commercial banks,  intervention isn't immediate upon every non-compliance. The RBI uses a tiered approach, escalating actions based on the severity and persistence of issues.  The initial stages involve warnings and directions for corrective actions.  Only if these are insufficient does the RBI move to more stringent measures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DICGC, a subsidiary of the RBI,  covers deposits held in commercial banks, *including* regional rural banks and other specified banks. The coverage isn't limited to commercial banks alone; its purpose is to protect depositors across a range of banking institutions.  The exclusion of certain types of deposits, like inter-bank deposits, is a separate matter and not directly related to the type of bank.

Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct, making option (d) the appropriate choice.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to evaluate the nuances of regulatory frameworks.


**2. With reference to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MSMED Act, 2006, defines MSMEs solely based on investment in plant and machinery, irrespective of turnover.
2. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime has significantly hampered the formalization of MSMEs due to its complexity and high compliance burden.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MSMED Act, 2006,  defines MSMEs based on *both* investment in plant and machinery *and* annual turnover.  The classification varies depending on the nature of the industry (manufacturing, service, etc.).  The question uses a deliberate oversimplification to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the GST regime initially presented challenges for MSMEs due to its complexity, it has also contributed to their formalization by bringing them into the tax net.  The simplification of GST procedures over time and various government initiatives aimed at reducing compliance burdens have mitigated the negative effects. The statement presents a partially true aspect (initial complexity) as a completely negative impact, acting as a distractor.

Therefore, neither statement is wholly accurate, leading to option (d) as the correct answer. This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, demanding a nuanced understanding of MSME policy.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decisions are binding on the RBI, leaving no room for independent action by the RBI Governor.
2. The RBI exclusively manages India's foreign exchange reserves, without any involvement from the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the MPC sets the policy rate (repo rate), the RBI Governor, as the head of the RBI, retains some degree of operational autonomy in implementing monetary policy. The RBI's actions are guided by the MPC's decisions but aren't entirely dictated by them. The statement oversimplifies the complex relationship between the MPC and the RBI Governor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI manages India's foreign exchange reserves, but it does so in consultation with the Government of India. The government plays a crucial role in setting overall macroeconomic goals, and the RBI's management of reserves is aligned with these targets.  The statement misrepresents the collaborative nature of this function.

Consequently, neither statement is entirely accurate, making (d) the correct answer. This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the RBI's functions and the dynamics of its relationship with the government.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act primarily deals with the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).
2.  The right to form cooperative societies is explicitly guaranteed as a fundamental right under Part III of the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act primarily deals with cooperative societies, not the NHRC. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. The statement incorrectly links the amendment with a different institution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the right to form associations and unions is a fundamental right (Article 19), the right to form cooperative societies is not explicitly mentioned as a fundamental right.  The 97th Amendment Act, however, brought cooperative societies under the ambit of the Constitution, making the formation of such societies a constitutional right.  The question misrepresents the legal basis of cooperative societies and their constitutional recognition.


Therefore, neither statement is entirely true, hence (d) is the correct answer. This question tests factual recall and understanding of constitutional provisions and amendments.


**5. With reference to Statutory Bail in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Statutory bail is applicable to all non-bailable offences, regardless of the potential punishment.
2. If a court denies statutory bail, it is not required to provide written reasons for the refusal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Statutory bail is not applicable to all non-bailable offences. It applies only to specific offences and under specific conditions defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).  The statement provides an overbroad application of statutory bail.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  If a court denies statutory bail, it *is* generally required to provide written reasons for the refusal. This is essential for ensuring transparency and accountability in the judicial process.  The statement incorrectly suggests a lack of judicial transparency.

Therefore, neither statement is correct, making (d) the right answer.  This question tests factual recall of procedural law and the ability to evaluate the implications of judicial decisions.


**6. With reference to Exit Polls in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Exit polls provide precise predictions of election outcomes at the individual candidate level.
2. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, explicitly regulates the conduct of exit polls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Exit polls provide estimates of voting patterns but are not always precise predictions, especially at the individual candidate level.  Factors such as sampling error and unforeseen changes in voter sentiment can affect accuracy. The statement overstates the precision of exit poll results.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Representation of the People Act, 1951, does not explicitly regulate exit polls.  However, the Election Commission of India (ECI) does issue guidelines to govern the timing and conduct of exit polls to maintain the fairness of the electoral process. The statement incorrectly identifies the legal basis for exit poll regulation.  The ECI guidelines are not part of the 1951 Act.

Hence, neither statement is accurate, making (d) the correct response. This question tests factual recall and understanding of electoral processes and regulations.


**7. Consider the following statements relating to the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE):**

1. The ICFRE is responsible for issuing Green Credits (GCs) under the Green Credit Program (GCP), a market-based mechanism to incentivize environmental conservation efforts.
2. The GCP operates under the provisions of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ICFRE acts as the administrator for the Green Credit Programme (GCP), issuing green credits as incentives for environmentally beneficial activities.  This is a key aspect of the GCP's market-based approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GCP operates under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, not the Energy Conservation Act, 2001.  The Energy Conservation Act focuses on energy efficiency, while the Environment (Protection) Act has a broader scope, encompassing environmental protection and conservation.  The question uses a distractor by confusing the legal basis of the GCP.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option. This question tests factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between related environmental legislation.


**8. With reference to the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RDSS aims to reduce Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses to pan-India levels below 10% by 2024-25.
2. Private sector DISCOMs are eligible for financial assistance under the RDSS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RDSS aims to reduce AT&C losses to pan-India levels of 12-15%, not below 10%, by 2024-25.  The target is a significant improvement but not as drastic as stated in the question. The statement provides a misleadingly low target.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RDSS specifically excludes private sector DISCOMs from receiving financial assistance.  The scheme focuses on supporting government-owned DISCOMs in improving their efficiency and financial health.  The statement incorrectly suggests that private sector DISCOMs are included.

Therefore, neither statement is correct, making (d) the appropriate answer. The question tests factual recall and the ability to understand the specific provisions of a government scheme.


**9. With reference to the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The NBS policy was introduced in 2015 with the objective of providing fertilizers to farmers at subsidized prices.
2. Under the NBS scheme, the Maximum Retail Prices (MRPs) of urea are market-determined.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NBS policy was introduced in 2010, not 2015. The year is a key piece of factual information that needs to be remembered accurately.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Under the NBS scheme, the MRPs of P&K fertilizers are market-determined, but the MRPs of urea are *fixed* by the government. Urea is a controlled commodity, unlike P&K fertilizers. The question uses a distractor by swapping the controlled and decontrolled fertilizers.

Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct, making (d) the correct answer.  This question tests knowledge of agricultural subsidies and their implementation.


**10. With reference to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The government aims to computerize all functional PACS by 2026 under a centrally sponsored project.
2. The expansion and modernization of PACS primarily focuses on improving agricultural marketing infrastructure, rather than storage facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The government aims to computerize 63,000 functional PACS, not all functional PACS, under the centrally sponsored project. The statement provides an inflated target number.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The expansion and modernization of PACS encompasses both improving agricultural marketing infrastructure *and* storage facilities (godowns).  The statement presents a partial aspect of the modernization effort as the sole focus.

Therefore, neither statement is fully correct; hence (d) is the answer.  This question tests recall of facts related to rural development initiatives.


These ten questions demonstrate the application of the specified criteria, creating challenging and nuanced MCQs suitable for the UPSC exam.  They require more than superficial knowledge, demanding accurate recall of facts and a deep understanding of the concepts involved.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question features two statements requiring factual recall and analysis, with four options and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on financial relations between the Union and the States, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 265 prohibits the levying of taxes except as authorized by the Constitution, thereby preventing arbitrary taxation by the Union or States.  
2. Article 280 mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission every five years to review the financial position of both the Union and the States and recommend the distribution of tax revenues between them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 265 of the Indian Constitution explicitly states that "No tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law." This fundamental principle ensures that taxation is not arbitrary and must be based on legally established procedures. It applies to both the Union and State governments, preventing them from imposing taxes without proper legislative backing.  This prevents arbitrary tax imposition and safeguards citizens' rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 280 does indeed establish the Finance Commission, its mandate is primarily focused on recommending the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States. It reviews the financial position of the States and recommends grants-in-aid to them, but its purview does not extend to a comprehensive review of the Union's financial position in the same manner. The Union's financial management is governed by separate articles and processes.  The Commission primarily focuses on equitable distribution of resources, not a holistic financial audit of the Union.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Finance Commission of India:**

1.  The Finance Commission's composition, powers, and functions are outlined in Article 270 of the Constitution, ensuring its independence and impartiality in tax revenue distribution.
2.  Articles 268, 269, and 269A deal with taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States, while Article 270 exclusively addresses the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Centre.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 270 deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  Article 280, not Article 270, outlines the Finance Commission's composition, powers, and functions. This distinction is crucial because Article 280 emphasizes the Commission's independent role in recommending the distribution of tax revenues, a function distinct from the mere allocation described in Article 270.

Statement 2 is correct.  Articles 268, 269, and 269A detail the specific taxes levied and collected by the Union but whose proceeds are assigned to the States.  Article 270, on the other hand, specifically addresses the distribution of the net proceeds of other taxes levied and collected by the Union, creating a clear division of responsibilities regarding tax revenue.  This division is critical for understanding the intricate financial architecture of the Indian federal system.


**3. With reference to Article 301 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 301 guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce throughout the territory of India, but this freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the Union government under Articles 302 to 305.
2. The freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by Article 301 applies only to interstate trade and does not extend to intrastate trade, reflecting the federal structure of the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 301 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce throughout the territory of India.  However, this freedom is not absolute. Articles 302 to 305 empower the Parliament to impose reasonable restrictions on this freedom in the national interest. These restrictions can be in the form of regulations concerning interstate trade, commerce, and intercourse. The balance between free trade and governmental regulatory power is a key aspect of India's economic policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 301 explicitly guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce *throughout* the territory of India.  This encompasses both interstate and intrastate trade.  While the Union government has greater power to regulate interstate trade, the fundamental principle of free movement of goods applies to trade within a state as well, though subject to state-level regulations.  Restricting the freedom to only interstate trade would contradict the very essence of Article 301.


**4. With reference to the Census in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Census Act of 1948 mandates the conduct of a decennial census, but the first complete census was conducted in 1881 under the British Raj.
2. The Census in India is conducted under the provisions of the Census Act of 1948, which provides the legal framework for data collection and enumeration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Census Act of 1948 provides the legal framework for the modern decennial census, the first complete census of India was actually conducted in 1881, not 1871, under British rule.  The statement incorrectly mixes up the year of the first complete census with the year of enactment of the current Census Act.  Understanding the historical context of the census is crucial in appreciating its evolution and significance.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Census Act of 1948 is the primary legislation governing the conduct of the Census in India. This Act outlines the procedures, powers, and responsibilities of the census commissioner and other officials involved in data collection, processing, and dissemination. The legal basis of the Census is essential for ensuring its accuracy and reliability, as well as its compliance with legal and ethical standards.


**5. With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, seeks to repeal the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, consolidating telecommunication laws.
2.  The Act permits interception, monitoring, or blocking of messages between two or more persons only with the explicit approval of the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Telecommunications Act, 2023 aims to modernize and consolidate the legal framework for telecommunications in India.  A key aspect of this is the repeal of the older, outdated Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933. This consolidation streamlines the regulatory process and addresses the complexities of modern communication technologies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, while outlining provisions for interception, monitoring, or blocking of communications, does *not* require the explicit approval of the Supreme Court for such actions.  The Act specifies certain grounds and procedures under which such actions can be taken, but these are subject to established legal processes and oversight mechanisms, potentially involving other judicial bodies or executive branches, not solely the Supreme Court.  The statement oversimplifies the complex legal framework for surveillance.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Pro-tem Speaker of the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly mentions the post of the Pro-tem Speaker of the Lok Sabha, detailing their powers and responsibilities.
2.  The Pro-tem Speaker's primary function is to administer the oath of office to newly elected Members of Parliament (MPs) before the election of the regular Speaker.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does *not* explicitly mention the post of the Pro-tem Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The process is established through convention and practice. While the Constitution outlines the role of the Speaker, the Pro-tem Speaker's position is a procedural arrangement to facilitate the smooth functioning of the Lok Sabha immediately after elections.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pro-tem Speaker, typically the oldest member of the Lok Sabha, plays a crucial bridging role. Their main responsibility is to administer the oath of office to the newly elected MPs, enabling the commencement of parliamentary proceedings before the election of the regular Speaker. This ensures the smooth transition of power and the commencement of legislative functions without delay.  This temporary role is crucial for the efficient functioning of the House.


**7. With reference to Article 3 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 3 empowers the Parliament to create new states by separating territory from existing states, but only with the prior approval of the Supreme Court.
2. A bill concerning the formation of new states under Article 3 requires the prior recommendation of the President before it can be introduced in Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 3 empowers Parliament to form new states, or alter the areas, boundaries, or names of existing ones. However, this power does not require prior approval from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's role is limited to judicial review if the legislative process is challenged in court on constitutional grounds. The statement erroneously inserts a judicial prerequisite into the legislative process.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 mandates that a bill proposing the formation of new states or altering existing ones must receive the prior recommendation of the President before being introduced in Parliament. This constitutional requirement underlines the significance of the President's role in such fundamental changes to the country's political geography. This safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensures a considered approach to state formation.



**8. With reference to mercy petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court can review and overturn decisions on mercy petitions, ensuring judicial oversight of the executive's discretionary power.
2. Mercy petitions can be filed only by individuals sentenced to death, excluding those convicted of other serious crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the power to grant mercy petitions rests with the President and Governors, the Supreme Court has, in certain cases, asserted its right to review the process if issues of fairness or due process are raised. The Court's ability to review the executive action is not a direct overturning power, but rather a check on the procedural aspects of the decision-making process.  This judicial review ensures that executive clemency is not exercised arbitrarily.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mercy petitions can be filed by individuals sentenced to death, but also by those convicted of other serious offenses. The President and Governors have the power to pardon, commute, remit, suspend, or respite sentences for various crimes, not just capital punishment.  The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of mercy petitions to death sentences only.


**9. With reference to the National Anthem of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana," was first publicly sung at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1911.
2. Showing respect to the National Anthem is a fundamental duty enshrined in Part IV-A of the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. "Jana Gana Mana" was first sung on December 27, 1911, at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress, not in 1929 as stated in the original prompt, and the Lahore session is also incorrect. The statement contains an incorrect date and session.

Statement 2 is correct.  Part IV-A of the Constitution of India, which outlines Fundamental Duties, includes the duty to show respect to the National Anthem. This duty reflects the importance of national symbols in fostering unity and patriotism. The statement accurately identifies this as a fundamental duty.  It's important to note that while the duty is enshrined, its enforcement is not explicitly detailed in the Constitution, leading to legal interpretations and debates.


**10. With reference to the Pro-tem Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The post of the Pro-tem Speaker is a constitutional provision explicitly mentioned in Article 93 of the Constitution.
2. The Pro-tem Speaker's role is primarily to administer the oath of office to members of Rajya Sabha before the election of the regular Speaker.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 93 deals with the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha.  The Pro-tem Speaker is not a constitutional provision but a convention. The statement misattributes the Pro-tem Speaker's constitutional basis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Pro-tem Speaker administers the oath of office to newly elected Members of Parliament (MPs) of the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  The Rajya Sabha has its own process for oath-taking, separate from the Lok Sabha’s procedures. The statement wrongly assigns the Pro-tem Speaker's duties to the Rajya Sabha.



**11.  With reference to the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), consider the following statements:**

1. PESA extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution (relating to Panchayats) to the Fifth Schedule areas, but excludes the Sixth Schedule areas.
2.  The Act mandates that Gram Sabhas have the authority to manage and utilize all natural resources within their respective areas, overriding all other laws.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PESA extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution, which deals with Panchayats, to the Fifth Schedule areas.  Crucially, it does *not* extend to the Sixth Schedule areas, which have their own unique governance structures.  The distinction is important for understanding the differentiated approach to governance in tribal areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PESA grants Gram Sabhas significant powers in the management and utilization of natural resources within their jurisdiction, it does *not* give them absolute authority overriding all other laws.  The Act aims to balance traditional tribal governance with the existing legal framework, ensuring that Gram Sabhas' decisions are made in consultation with relevant authorities and existing laws.  The statement overstates the scope of Gram Sabhas' powers.


**12. With reference to Article 86 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 86 mandates that the President must address both Houses of Parliament assembled together at the commencement of every session.
2.  Article 86 grants the President the power to address either House of Parliament, or both Houses assembled together.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 86 does *not* mandate that the President *must* address both Houses at the commencement of every session.  The practice of the President addressing a joint sitting of Parliament is a convention, not a constitutional obligation. The statement misinterprets the constitutional provision as mandatory.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 86 grants the President the power to address either House of Parliament, or both Houses assembled together.  This reflects the President's role as the head of state and allows for flexibility in addressing Parliament, depending on the context and circumstances. The statement accurately reflects the President's constitutional power regarding addressing Parliament.  It is important to understand that this power is exercised by convention and through established procedures.


**13. With reference to the Committee of Privileges of the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee of Privileges of Rajya Sabha consists of 15 members, nominated by the Speaker of Lok Sabha.
2.  Parliamentary privileges are special rights and immunities granted only to members of Parliament, excluding other government functionaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Committee of Privileges of the Rajya Sabha consists of 15 members, nominated by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.  The statement incorrectly attributes the nominating authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While parliamentary privileges are primarily granted to members of Parliament, they extend to some other government functionaries involved in the legislative process, including officers of the Parliament and other officials necessary for the smooth functioning of the legislature.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of parliamentary privileges.  The extent of these privileges is a subject of ongoing legal interpretation and debate.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the President's Address to Parliament:**

1. Prior to the First Amendment of the Constitution, the President was required to address both Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every session.
2. Article 87 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to address either House or both Houses of Parliament assembled together.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly asserts a constitutional requirement prior to the First Amendment.  The President's addressing of Parliament is a convention, not a mandatory constitutional requirement, before or after the First Amendment.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 87 (and not Article 86) of the Constitution deals with the President's power to address Parliament. It grants the President the power to address either House or both Houses assembled together.  This power reflects the President's role as Head of State and allows for flexibility in addressing Parliament.  The actual practice and procedure surrounding the address are governed by parliamentary rules and conventions.


**15. With reference to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, introduced the Panchayati Raj system in India, providing a three-tier structure of governance at the grassroots level.
2. The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee's report, submitted in 1957, recommended the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions to strengthen local self-governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992, not the 74th, introduced the Panchayati Raj system, providing a three-tier structure at the grassroots level. The 74th Amendment dealt with urban local bodies.  The statement incorrectly mixes up the amendment numbers.

Statement 2 is correct. The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee, in its report submitted in 1957, recommended the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) as a three-tier system of local self-governance. This recommendation was a landmark moment in the development of India's decentralized governance structure. The committee's report significantly shaped India's approach to rural development and local administration.  It's important to note that the actual implementation of the recommendations took some time.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, employing various techniques to create plausible distractors and challenging options.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The 91st Constitutional Amendment Act of 2003 capped the total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, at 15% of the total strength of the Rajya Sabha.
2.  Article 75(1) of the Constitution mandates that the President appoints the Prime Minister and other ministers solely based on the President's discretion, without any external influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 91st Amendment Act of 2003 limits the total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, to 15% of the total strength of the Lok Sabha (House of the People), not the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).  The Rajya Sabha's size doesn't directly determine the size of the Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President appoints the Prime Minister and other ministers, Article 75(1) explicitly states that the appointment of ministers other than the Prime Minister is done *on the advice* of the Prime Minister. This demonstrates the principle of parliamentary executive, where the President acts on the advice of the elected government. The President does not have absolute discretion in this matter.  The power rests with the elected government, reflecting the democratic nature of the Indian political system.


**2. With reference to the Indian electoral system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Silence Period" preceding Lok Sabha elections prohibits all forms of campaigning, including the dissemination of opinion polls and exit polls, through any medium.
2.  The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) applies only to recognized national parties during Lok Sabha elections, exempting regional parties from its purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "Silence Period" restricts campaigning significantly, it does *not* entirely prohibit the dissemination of opinion polls and exit polls.  The restriction primarily focuses on active campaigning by candidates and political parties.  The publication of opinion polls and exit polls is usually subject to specific guidelines and regulations, but not a complete ban.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) applies to *all* contesting parties, irrespective of their recognition status (national or regional) during Lok Sabha elections. The MCC aims to ensure a level playing field for all participants and maintain the fairness and integrity of the electoral process.  Exempting regional parties would create an uneven playing field and undermine the principles of free and fair elections.


**3. With reference to the functions of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Speaker's salary is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India, mirroring the salary structure of other Members of Parliament.
2.  A motion of no-confidence can be moved against the Speaker at any time, requiring only a simple majority for its passage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Speaker's salary is indeed drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India, but unlike other MPs, whose salaries are determined by a statute voted on by the House itself, the Speaker's salary has a separate provision and is not subject to the same legislative process as other MPs' salaries.  This reflects the Speaker's unique and independent position within the Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a motion of no-confidence can be moved against the Speaker, it's not possible at any time.  Article 94 of the Constitution specifies that such a motion requires a 14-day notice period. Furthermore, a simple majority is not sufficient; the motion needs to be passed by the House. The process of removing the Speaker is designed to prevent hasty or arbitrary actions and ensure stability in parliamentary proceedings.



**4. With reference to the Disaster Management Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) is solely funded by the Central Government, while the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) is entirely funded by state governments.
2.  States utilize funds from the SDRF before seeking assistance from the NDRF only if the disaster's magnitude exceeds the SDRF's capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NDRF is primarily funded by the Central Government, the SDRF receives contributions from both the Centre and the State governments.  States contribute a percentage (varying for special category states) to the SDRF, demonstrating a shared responsibility in disaster management.

Statement 2 is correct. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, outlines a hierarchical approach to disaster funding. States are expected to first utilize their SDRF resources.  Only when the scale of the disaster surpasses the SDRF's capacity do states approach the NDRF for additional funds. This system prioritizes efficient resource allocation and ensures that states are proactive in managing disasters within their capabilities.


**5. With reference to the 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act made the formation of cooperative societies a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
2.  Cooperative societies are primarily regulated by the central government, ensuring uniformity across all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 97th Amendment Act, 2011, indeed made the right to form cooperative societies a fundamental right, but it did so under Article 19(1)(c), not Article 19(1)(g). Article 19(1)(c) deals with the right to form associations or unions, which includes cooperative societies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although the central government plays a role in guiding cooperative society policies, the primary authority for legislating and regulating cooperative societies rests with the state governments. This is because cooperative societies are listed under the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.  The decentralized approach allows states to tailor regulations to their specific contexts and needs.


**6. With reference to the provisions related to ministers in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Third Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the procedure for the removal of ministers.
2. The total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, cannot exceed 15% of the total membership of the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Third Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the Forms of Oaths or Affirmations to be taken by various constitutional functionaries, including ministers. The procedure for the removal of ministers is not outlined in the Third Schedule; it is implied through the collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha and the Prime Minister's power to recommend the dismissal of a minister to the President.

Statement 2 is correct. The 91st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003, introduced this provision, limiting the size of the Council of Ministers to maintain efficiency and avoid unwieldy governance. This reflects a concern for effective and accountable governance.


**7.  With reference to the appointment and removal of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule.
2. The CEC and Election Commissioners enjoy a tenure of six years or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier, and their removal requires a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission of India (ECI), headed by the CEC, is responsible for deciding the election schedule, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. This independence is crucial for ensuring the impartiality and fairness of elections.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CEC and Election Commissioners do have a tenure of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier, their removal does *not* require a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament.  They can be removed by the President on grounds of proved misbehavior or incapacity, after consultation with the Supreme Court.  The process is designed to protect the independence of the ECI while ensuring accountability.


**8. With reference to the  President of India's oath of office, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's oath of office is mentioned in Article 52 of the Constitution.
2. The oath of office to the President is administered by the Vice-President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 52 deals with the President of India's office, not the oath of office. The oath of office is detailed in Article 60.  This distinction is important; Article 52 establishes the position, while Article 60 outlines the procedure for assuming office.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The oath of office to the President is administered by the Chief Justice of India, not the Vice-President. The Chief Justice's role reflects the judiciary's role in upholding the Constitution and ensures the sanctity of the process.  The Vice-President assumes the President's role only in the event of a vacancy or inability.


**9. With reference to the First Past the Post (FPTP) system, consider the following statements:**

1.  In FPTP, a candidate needs an absolute majority (more than 50% of the votes) to win a seat.
2.  Israel utilizes the FPTP system for its parliamentary elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In the FPTP system, the candidate who secures the most votes in a constituency wins the seat, regardless of whether they have an absolute majority of votes.  A plurality, not a majority, is sufficient for victory.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Israel uses a system of Proportional Representation (PR) for its parliamentary elections, not FPTP.  PR aims to allocate seats proportionally to the votes received by each party, unlike FPTP, where the winner takes all in individual constituencies.  This difference in electoral systems leads to different outcomes and party dynamics.


**10. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of SCS was first introduced by the Tenth Finance Commission in 1979.
2.  Telangana was granted SCS after its formation in 2014, based on its socio-economic backwardness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The concept of SCS was first introduced by the Fifth Finance Commission in 1969, not the Tenth Finance Commission in 1979.  The Fifth Finance Commission's recommendation marked the beginning of the SCS policy, aimed at providing special financial assistance to states facing socio-economic challenges and geographical disadvantages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Telangana did receive special financial assistance after its formation, it was not formally granted SCS. The criteria for granting SCS are stringent and involve factors like tribal population, population density, hilly terrain, proximity to international borders, and socio-economic backwardness.  Telangana's case did not meet all these criteria to qualify for SCS.  The special assistance provided was a different policy measure.


**11. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC was established in 1993 in accordance with the Bangkok Principles.
2. The NHRC can investigate cases of human rights violations by armed forces without any limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC was established in 1993, but in accordance with the *Paris* Principles, not the Bangkok Principles. The Paris Principles are international guidelines for national human rights institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the NHRC has broad powers, it faces limitations regarding investigations into human rights violations by armed forces. It cannot directly investigate such cases but can seek reports from the Union Government and issue recommendations. This limitation reflects the sensitive nature of security matters and the need to balance human rights with national security concerns.


**12. With reference to the Cooperative Societies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, made the right to form cooperative societies a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.
2. State governments have the primary legislative power over cooperative societies, although the central government can also legislate on matters of national importance concerning cooperative societies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, did indeed make the right to form cooperative societies a fundamental right, but under Article 19(1)(c), which pertains to the freedom of association, not Article 19(1)(a), which concerns freedom of speech and expression.

Statement 2 is correct. Cooperative societies fall under the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, granting state governments primary legislative power. However, the central government can legislate on matters of national importance related to cooperative societies, based on the doctrine of incidental or ancillary powers.  This reflects the federal structure of the Indian Constitution, allowing for both state-level and national-level regulation.


**13. With reference to the Election Commission of India (ECI), consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners for a term of five years, or until they attain the age of 62, whichever is earlier.
2. The ECI resolves disputes relating to splits or mergers of recognized political parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President does appoint the CEC and Election Commissioners, but their term is six years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier, not five years and 62.  This longer tenure is designed to provide stability and independence to the ECI.

Statement 2 is correct. The ECI plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the political party system. It has the authority to resolve disputes arising from splits or mergers of recognized political parties, ensuring that the process is fair and transparent.  This function is crucial for maintaining order and stability in the Indian political landscape.


**14. With reference to the MPLADS scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The annual drawing limit allocated to MPs at the beginning of each financial year is fixed and cannot be altered under any circumstances.
2.  All payments under MPLADS are made directly to the vendors from the Central Nodal Account on a real-time basis, once the implementing authorities authorize the payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While MPs are allocated annual drawing limits at the start of each financial year, these limits are not fixed and inflexible.  They can be adjusted based on certain conditions, such as the availability of funds and the progress of ongoing projects.  Flexibility is built into the system to accommodate varying needs and project timelines.

Statement 2 is correct.  The MPLADS scheme aims for transparency and efficiency in fund disbursement.  The system of direct payments to vendors from the Central Nodal Account on a real-time basis minimizes delays and ensures accountability in the utilization of funds.  This system enhances transparency and reduces the scope for corruption.


**15. With reference to the provisions related to the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in Parliament only after the President has obtained the views of the concerned state legislature.  The President is bound by these views.
2. Article 3 of the Constitution authorizes Parliament to form a new state by separating territory from any existing state, uniting two or more states, or uniting any territory to a part of any state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Article 3 requires the President to obtain the views of the concerned state legislature before recommending a bill for state formation, the President is *not* bound by these views. The President can accept or reject them based on a holistic assessment of the situation. This flexibility is crucial in cases where the state legislature's opinion might not align with national interests or broader constitutional considerations.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 grants Parliament wide-ranging powers to alter the boundaries, areas, and names of existing states and form new states.  This provision reflects the central government's role in maintaining national unity and territorial integrity while respecting the principle of federalism.


**16. With reference to the  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Chairperson and members of the NHRC are appointed by the President for a term of five years or until they reach the age of 75, whichever is earlier.
2. State Human Rights Commissions can investigate cases of human rights violations by armed forces and seek information from the Union Government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Chairperson and members of the NHRC are appointed by the President, but their term is three years or until the age of 70, whichever is earlier, not five years and 75.  The shorter term is intended to ensure regular review and rejuvenation of the Commission's leadership.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  State Human Rights Commissions lack the authority to investigate cases of human rights violations by armed forces. Even at the national level, the NHRC can only seek reports from the Union Government and make recommendations; it cannot directly investigate. This restriction reflects the sensitive nature of national security and the need for a balance between human rights and national security concerns.  The Union Government's exclusive powers in this area are constitutionally protected.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the powers of the President and Prime Minister of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can dismiss a Minister on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, but the Prime Minister's recommendation is not binding on the President.
2. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who then advises the President on the appointment of other Ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Prime Minister recommends the dismissal of a Minister, the final authority rests with the President.  The President is not bound by the Prime Minister's advice in this matter and can exercise their discretion. This reflects the constitutional balance of power between the executive branches.  The President's power to act independently, albeit rarely exercised, safeguards against potential abuse of power by the Prime Minister.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, usually the leader of the party with a majority in the Lok Sabha.  Following this appointment, the Prime Minister recommends the individuals for other ministerial positions, and the President then formally appoints them. This process highlights the convention of the Prime Minister's role in forming the Council of Ministers while maintaining the President's formal power of appointment.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the National Anthem of India:**

1.  The National Anthem, "Jana Gana Mana," was originally composed in Hindi by Rabindranath Tagore and later adopted by the Constituent Assembly.
2.  Showing disrespect to the National Anthem is a punishable offense under the National Honour Act, 1971, which prescribes a maximum sentence of up to 3 years of imprisonment, a fine, or both.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  "Jana Gana Mana" was originally composed in Bengali, not Hindi, by Rabindranath Tagore. The Hindi version was subsequently adopted.  This detail highlights the linguistic context of the National Anthem's creation and its subsequent adaptation for wider national use. The original Bengali composition reflects a specific cultural and historical context.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Honour Act, 1971, criminalizes intentional obstruction of the singing of the National Anthem.  The specified penalties underscore the legal framework surrounding the respect and dignity afforded to the National Anthem within the Indian legal system. The severity of the potential punishment reflects the importance attached to national symbols.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on tax devolution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 280 mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission to recommend the distribution of taxes between the Union and the States, but it does not specify the taxes to be shared.
2. Article 270 deals with the principles governing the distribution of grants-in-aid to States by the Union, but not the distribution of taxes collected by the Union.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 280 does indeed mandate the establishment of a Finance Commission, which recommends the principles governing the distribution of taxes and grants-in-aid between the Union and the States.  However,  Article 270 specifically addresses the distribution of certain taxes collected by the Union, outlining the framework for tax devolution.  The statement incorrectly attributes the tax distribution function solely to Article 280.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 270 deals explicitly with the distribution of taxes collected by the Union. Article 280 deals with the Finance Commission's recommendations on both tax devolution and grants-in-aid.  The statement misrepresents the primary focus of Article 270.


**4. With reference to mercy petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mercy petitions can only be filed by individuals sentenced to life imprisonment, not those sentenced to death.
2.  The Governor can pardon sentences for offenses under both Union and State laws.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mercy petitions can be filed by individuals sentenced to both death and imprisonment.  This demonstrates the scope of the power of pardon and clemency available under the Indian legal system.  The statement incorrectly restricts the eligibility for filing a mercy petition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President has the power to pardon sentences for offenses under Union laws, while Governors have the power for offenses under State laws. This division of power reflects the federal structure of the Indian government. The statement incorrectly attributes the power of pardon to the Governor in both spheres.


**5. With reference to the process of renaming a state in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 3 of the Constitution empowers Parliament to alter the name of any state, but only with the prior recommendation of the President; and before this, the President must refer the bill to the state legislature for its views.
2.  The President's recommendation for a name change is binding on Parliament; Parliament cannot proceed without it.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution outlines the procedure for altering the boundaries or names of states.  It explicitly requires the President's prior recommendation for such a bill to be introduced in Parliament.  Furthermore, the President must consult with the state legislature concerned before making the recommendation.  This process ensures intergovernmental consultation and protects the interests of the affected state.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's prior recommendation is required, it is not binding on Parliament. Parliament retains the power to proceed with the bill even if the President's recommendation is not forthcoming.  This implies that the President's role is advisory rather than a veto power.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Census:**

1. The Census in India has been conducted regularly since 1871, with the first complete census taking place in 1881.
2. The Census Act of 1948 provides the constitutional mandate for conducting periodic population surveys in India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the British initiated census-like operations earlier, the regular conduct of the Census began in 1871. The first complete census was conducted in 1881, a significant milestone in understanding India’s demographic landscape.  The statement correctly identifies the starting point of regular census operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Census is conducted under the Census Act of 1948, but this Act is a statutory framework, not a constitutional mandate.  The Constitution does not explicitly mention the Census. The statement incorrectly attributes a constitutional basis to the Census Act.


**7. With reference to the Post Office Act (2023), consider the following statements:**

1. The Post Office Act (2023) repeals the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, due to significant advancements in postal services.
2. Postal services in India are under the Union List, granting the Union Government exclusive privilege over conveying letters.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Post Office Act (2023) does *not* repeal the 1898 Act.  It amends and consolidates the existing legal framework. The statement wrongly suggests a complete replacement of the older Act. The continuation of the 1898 Act, albeit amended, points to the gradual evolution of postal legislation in India.

Statement 2 is correct.  Postal services fall under the Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, giving the Union Government exclusive power in this domain.  This reflects the central government's control over national communication infrastructure. The exclusive privilege over letter conveyance underlines the government's monopoly in this crucial service.


**8. With reference to the declaration of a State of Emergency in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A State of Emergency has been declared three times in India, all on grounds of external aggression.
2.  The President declares a State of Emergency on the advice of the Prime Minister, but the Prime Minister's advice is not binding on the President.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a State of Emergency has been proclaimed three times, the third proclamation (1975) was based on grounds of "internal disturbance," not external aggression.  The first two were indeed due to external aggression (1962, 1971). This distinction underscores the differing circumstances under which emergencies can be invoked. The statement incorrectly presents a unified ground for all three emergency declarations.

Statement 2 is correct. The President has the power to proclaim a State of Emergency, but they typically act on the advice of the Prime Minister. However, the President retains the constitutional power to act independently in this crucial matter, although it is rarely exercised. This demonstrates the constitutional checks and balances.


**9. With reference to the election of the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly mentions the post of Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha and outlines the procedure for their election.
2. The Deputy Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not explicitly mention the post of Deputy Speaker. However, the procedure for their election is established through parliamentary conventions and practices. The absence of explicit mention in the Constitution indicates that this position is a matter of parliamentary procedure rather than a constitutional mandate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lok Sabha elects its Deputy Speaker from among its members.  This reflects the democratic process within the Lok Sabha. The election process underlines the House's autonomy in choosing its presiding officers.  


**10.  Consider the following statements about the  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019:**

1. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in employment, education, and healthcare, but not in housing.
2. The Act mandates the issuance of a certificate of identity to each transgender person, allowing self-perception of gender identity, but this certificate must be issued by a District Magistrate.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, explicitly prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in employment, education, healthcare, and *other services*, which includes housing. The statement omits housing from the list of protected areas, creating a misleading impression about the Act’s scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Act does allow for self-perception of gender identity through a certificate of identity, it does not mandate that the certificate *must* be issued by a District Magistrate. The statement introduces a specific, incorrect requirement for the certificate issuance.  The ambiguity surrounding the issuing authority is a deliberate distractor.


**11. With reference to the powers of the Governor of a state, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Governor can promulgate an ordinance even when the state legislature is in session, provided the President gives prior consent.
2.  The Governor cannot promulgate an ordinance on matters on which the state legislature cannot make laws.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Governor's power to promulgate ordinances is restricted to periods when the state legislature is *not* in session.  The statement incorrectly suggests that the Governor can bypass this limitation with Presidential consent. The restriction on ordinance issuance during legislative sessions reflects a constitutional safeguard against executive overreach.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Governor's ordinance-making power is subject to the same limitations as the state legislature's law-making power.  This ensures that the Governor does not exceed their constitutional authority. The statement correctly highlights this crucial limitation on the Governor's powers.


**12.  With reference to the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act extends the provisions of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act to Scheduled Areas, but only with modifications to suit the specific needs of these areas.
2.  The Act mandates the establishment of Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas as the primary institution of self-governance.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, extends the provisions of the 73rd Amendment to Scheduled Areas, but it also incorporates modifications to ensure that the Panchayati Raj system respects the customary laws and traditions of the tribal communities in those areas. The modifications highlight the need for sensitive implementation of the Panchayati Raj system in diverse contexts.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act gives Gram Sabhas a central role in the governance of Scheduled Areas.  This underscores the importance of grassroots democracy and participation in these areas. The statement accurately reflects the Act’s focus on strengthening tribal self-governance.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the  Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023:**

1. The BNS, 2023, raised the age of consent for a married woman under the definition of rape from 15 to 18 years, eliminating the marital rape exception.
2. The BNS, 2023, replaces the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, but retains some provisions related to criminal procedure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BNS, 2023, did raise the age of consent for a married woman under the definition of rape from 15 to 18 years. However, it *does not* eliminate the marital rape exception; it retains this controversial provision. The retention of the exception highlights the ongoing debate surrounding marital rape and the complexities of legal reform.

Statement 2 is correct. The BNS, 2023, is intended to replace the IPC, 1860.  While it aims for a comprehensive overhaul of criminal law, it is not a complete departure from all aspects of the IPC, retaining elements of criminal procedure. The partial retention is a key consideration for understanding the nature of the reform.


**14. With reference to the  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIS was established under the BIS Act, 2016, replacing the Indian Standards Institution (ISI), and functions under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
2. The BIS's primary function is to formulate and periodically revise (every five years) Indian Standards through a consultative process involving technical committees.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the BIS replaced the ISI, it was initially established under the BIS Act, 1986, and later restructured under the BIS Act, 2016. The statement provides the incorrect year of establishment.  The ministry under which it functions is also incorrect; it falls under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Statement 2 is correct.  The BIS's key function is the formulation and periodic revision (every five years) of Indian Standards.  This is achieved through an inclusive consultative process involving technical committees. This function highlights the BIS's role in maintaining and updating national quality standards.


**15. With reference to the  Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act decriminalizes 183 provisions across 42 laws, but only those administered by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
2. The Act introduces a mechanism for periodic revision (10% increase every three years) of fines and penalties for various offenses in specified Acts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Jan Vishwas Act decriminalizes 183 provisions across 42 laws.  However, it is not limited to laws administered solely by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs; it covers laws administered by 19 ministries/departments.  The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the Act's decriminalization efforts.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the Act is the mechanism for the periodic revision (10% increase every three years) of fines and penalties. This ensures that penalties remain relevant and effective over time.  The statement accurately reflects this important aspect of the Act.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the  Supreme Court's judgment in the Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty vs Union of India case:**

1. The Supreme Court unanimously held that there is a fundamental right to marry in India, applicable to all irrespective of sexual orientation.
2. The Supreme Court upheld the restriction imposed by the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) on non-heterosexual couples from adopting.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court in the Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty case did *not* recognize a fundamental right to marry applicable to all regardless of sexual orientation.  The judgment held that there was no such unequivocal right.  The statement misrepresents the core finding of the case.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court upheld CARA’s restrictions on adoption by non-heterosexual couples.  This aspect of the judgment highlights the court's approach to balancing individual rights with existing legal frameworks. The court's decision reflects the cautious approach towards legal reform in sensitive areas.


**17. With reference to the  Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN), consider the following statements:**

1. PM JANMAN was launched as part of the Union Budget 2023-24, aiming to saturate Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) households with basic facilities like safe housing and clean drinking water.
2. PM JANMAN comprises 11 critical interventions through 9 ministries, with an estimated outlay of ₹24,104 crore for 5 years.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM JANMAN, announced in the Union Budget 2023-24, aims to provide basic facilities to PVTG households. This highlights the government's focus on improving the living conditions of vulnerable communities. The statement accurately describes the program's objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PM JANMAN comprises 11 critical interventions through 9 ministries, but the estimated outlay is for *3 years*, not 5 years. The statement provides the incorrect duration of the program's financial outlay.  The difference in duration is a deliberate distractor.


**18. With reference to the ordinance-making power of the President and Governor, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can issue ordinances only when both Houses of Parliament are not in session.
2.  A Governor cannot issue an ordinance on a matter requiring prior Presidential sanction for introduction in the state assembly.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President can issue ordinances when Parliament is not in session.  The statement incorrectly specifies that *both* houses must be in recess. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the constitutional provision.  The power is applicable even if one house is in session.

Statement 2 is correct.  A Governor is restricted from issuing an ordinance in matters requiring prior Presidential sanction for introduction in the state assembly, or if the Governor would have reserved a similar bill for the President's consideration, or if a similar state law would be invalid without Presidential assent.  This restriction highlights the constitutional limitations on the Governor's power in relation to the President.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding the Secretariat of Parliament:**

1. Article 98 of the Constitution mandates a separate secretarial staff for each House of Parliament, but it does not regulate their recruitment or service conditions.
2. The Secretary-Generals of both Houses of Parliament hold ranks equivalent to that of the Cabinet Secretary and are placed at the same position in the Table of Precedence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 98 mandates separate secretarial staff for each House, but it delegates the regulation of recruitment and service conditions to Parliament through legislation.  The absence of such legislation highlights the reliance on parliamentary practice for these matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Secretary-Generals hold ranks equivalent to the Cabinet Secretary, they are *not* placed at the same position in the Table of Precedence. The difference in precedence reflects the nuanced hierarchy within the governmental structure. The statement wrongly implies equal precedence.


**20. With reference to Democratic Decentralization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, added Part IX-A to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).
2. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992, added the 11th Schedule to the Constitution, listing the 29 functional items of municipalities.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment added Part IX to the Constitution, concerning PRIs.  Part IX-A was added by the 74th Amendment, dealing with Municipalities.  The statement mistakenly attributes Part IX-A to the 73rd Amendment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 74th Amendment added Part IX-A and the 12th Schedule (18 functional items for municipalities), not the 11th Schedule (29 functional items for Panchayats).  The statement wrongly attributes the 11th Schedule to the 74th Amendment.  The confusion between the 11th and 12th schedules and the parts they are added to is a deliberate distractor.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The PESA Act, 1996, extends the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution relating to Panchayats to the 5th Scheduled Areas without any modifications.
2.  The election of the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha is solely governed by Article 93 of the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PESA Act, 1996, while extending the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution (relating to Panchayats) to the 5th Scheduled Areas, does so with *modifications*.  The Act acknowledges the unique needs and governance structures of tribal communities in these areas, thus requiring a tailored approach rather than a direct application of Part IX. This nuanced approach is crucial for understanding the Act's significance in empowering tribal self-governance.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Article 93 mentions the election of both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, the election of the Deputy Speaker is primarily governed by Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. Article 93 sets the broad constitutional mandate, but the detailed procedural aspects are handled by the Lok Sabha's internal rules.  Ignoring this distinction overlooks the important role of parliamentary procedures in shaping the functioning of legislative bodies.


**2. With reference to the National Emergency provisions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A financial emergency, as outlined in Article 360 of the Constitution, has been declared thrice in India's history.
2.  The declaration of a national emergency under Article 352 requires the approval of both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A financial emergency under Article 360 has *never* been proclaimed in India. This highlights the stringent conditions and the exceptional circumstances required for its invocation, underscoring the stability of India's financial system.  The statement incorrectly attributes three instances of declaration to this provision, confusing it with the national emergency provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The proclamation of a national emergency under Article 352 is a significant power vested in the President, but it is not absolute.  It requires parliamentary approval.  The Constitution mandates that the proclamation must be placed before both Houses of Parliament, which can approve or disapprove it. This demonstrates the constitutional checks and balances in place to prevent misuse of emergency powers.


**3. With reference to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Speaker's election is mandated by Article 93, and this article also specifies that the Speaker must be a member of the ruling party.
2.  The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha automatically assumes the Speaker's responsibilities in the Speaker's absence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Article 93 mandates the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, it does *not* stipulate that the Speaker must belong to the ruling party. This is a convention, not a constitutional requirement.  The statement incorrectly merges a constitutional provision with a political convention, thereby creating a misleading assertion.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for analyzing the relationship between constitutional provisions and political realities.

Statement 2 is correct. In the absence of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker automatically assumes the Speaker's functions. This provision ensures the continuity of parliamentary proceedings and the smooth functioning of the Lok Sabha.  The smooth transition of power in the absence of the Speaker is a key aspect of parliamentary efficiency and stability.


**4. With reference to the PESA Act, 1996, consider the following statements:**

1. The PESA Act grants tribal communities control over all aspects of land management, including privately owned lands within Scheduled Areas.
2. The Act mandates the establishment of Gram Sabhas in all 5th Scheduled Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PESA Act grants tribal communities significant control over the management and utilization of natural resources in Scheduled Areas, but this control is primarily focused on *common* resources like forests, water, and land. The Act does *not* extend to privately owned lands within Scheduled Areas. This highlights the Act's limitations and the complexities involved in balancing tribal rights with other land ownership claims.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the PESA Act recognizes the importance of Gram Sabhas in the governance of Scheduled Areas, it does *not* mandate their establishment in *all* 5th Scheduled Areas. The establishment of Gram Sabhas is left to the state governments, which may adapt their implementation depending on local circumstances. This shows the flexibility in the application of the Act and the importance of state-level involvement in its implementation.


**5. With reference to the Parliamentary Privileges, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha is chaired by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
2.  Parliamentary privileges are special rights and immunities granted exclusively to members of the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha is chaired by the *Chairman* of the Rajya Sabha, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Each House has its own committee to deal with matters of privilege within its jurisdiction.  Confusing the roles of the Speaker and Chairman reveals a lack of understanding of the bicameral structure of the Indian Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Parliamentary privileges are granted to *both* Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and their members.  The statement falsely restricts these privileges to only the Rajya Sabha, neglecting a fundamental aspect of parliamentary equality and the shared powers of both Houses.  This misconception demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core principles of parliamentary functioning.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Prior to the First Amendment of the Constitution, Article 87(1) allowed the President to address Parliament only at the beginning of the first session of each year.
2.  Article 87 of the Constitution provides for two instances when the President specially addresses both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Before the First Amendment, Article 87(1) mandated the President to address both Houses of Parliament at the *commencement of every session*, not just at the beginning of the first session of each year. The amendment later modified this to specify the address at the beginning of the first session after each general election and at the commencement of the first session of each year. The statement incorrectly restricts the frequency of the presidential address, demonstrating a lack of precision in understanding the constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 87 indeed outlines two specific occasions when the President addresses both Houses of Parliament: (i) at the beginning of the first session after each general election, and (ii) at the commencement of the first session of each year.  This highlights the importance of these addresses in the functioning of the Indian Parliament.


**7. With reference to the National Development Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee report, published in the early 1950s, recommended the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system.
2. The Panchayat system was implemented in rural areas nationwide in 1952, following the recommendations of the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee report, submitted in the early 1950s, indeed recommended the formation of a democratic three-tier Panchayati Raj system at the grassroots level. This recommendation played a pivotal role in shaping India's decentralized governance structure.  The statement accurately reflects the committee's key contribution to rural development policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The nationwide implementation of the Panchayati Raj system followed the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1993, not in 1952. While the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee's recommendations were influential, the actual implementation came much later through constitutional amendments. The statement incorrectly attributes the implementation to a time before the constitutional provisions were in place, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the historical timeline of the Panchayati Raj system's development.


**8. With reference to the High Seas Treaty, consider the following statements:**

1. The High Seas Treaty aims to regulate activities in areas of the world's oceans that fall under national jurisdictions.
2.  The High Seas Treaty will come into force after it is ratified by at least 60 countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The High Seas Treaty, formally known as the "Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction" (BBNJ Agreement),  focuses on areas *outside* national jurisdictions, i.e., the high seas. The treaty aims to govern the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in these international waters. The statement incorrectly defines the treaty's scope as including areas under national jurisdiction, demonstrating a confusion regarding the concept of "high seas."

Statement 2 is correct. The High Seas Treaty, like many international agreements, requires ratification by a specified number of countries before it enters into force.  The threshold for the High Seas Treaty is 60 countries, ensuring broad international participation and legitimacy. The accurate description of the treaty's entry into force showcases the understanding of international legal processes.


**9. With reference to the  Andaman and Nicobar Islands, consider the following statements:**

1. The capital city, Port Blair, is located in the North Andaman.
2. The Ten Degree Channel separates the Andaman Islands from the Nicobar Islands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is located in *South Andaman*, not North Andaman.  This simple factual error highlights the importance of precise geographical knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The *Ten Degree Channel* separates the Andaman Islands from the Nicobar Islands. The statement incorrectly identifies the Eight Degree Channel as the separating feature. This error showcases the significance of accuracy in geographical knowledge regarding island groups.


**10. With reference to the Subansiri River, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Subansiri River originates in the Eastern Ghats.
2.  The Subansiri River is a left-bank tributary of the Brahmaputra River.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Subansiri River originates in the *Eastern Himalayas*, not the Eastern Ghats.  Confusing the Himalayan and Ghats mountain ranges shows a lack of understanding of Indian geography.

Statement 2 is correct. The Subansiri River is indeed a major left-bank tributary of the Brahmaputra River. This accurate identification of the river's location within the Brahmaputra river system demonstrates an understanding of Indian river systems.


**11. With reference to the Siang Valley, consider the following statements:**

1. The Siang River, which flows through the Siang Valley, is known as the Brahmaputra River in Tibet.
2. The Siang Valley is primarily inhabited by the Apatani tribe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Siang River, flowing through the Siang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh, is known as the *Yarlung Tsangpo* in Tibet, not the Brahmaputra River. The Brahmaputra River is the name it takes after exiting Tibet.  This error points to a misunderstanding of the river's course and nomenclature.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Siang Valley is home to the *Adi* tribe, known for its rich cultural heritage. The Apatani tribe inhabits the Ziro Valley in the same state. Confusing the tribal groups inhabiting different valleys in Arunachal Pradesh highlights the need for precise knowledge about the region's demographics.


**12. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The terms 'Lal' and 'Mursan' are associated with traditional water harvesting techniques in certain parts of India.
2.  Mount Ibu, recently in the news, is located in the Philippines.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The terms 'Lal' and 'Mursan' refer to traditional water harvesting structures found in certain regions of India, particularly in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.  This demonstrates knowledge of traditional water management techniques.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mount Ibu is located in *Indonesia*, not the Philippines. This error shows a lack of precise geographical knowledge regarding volcanic locations.


**13. With reference to the Netherlands, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Netherlands shares land borders with Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland.
2.  The Netherlands shares a maritime border with Ukraine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Netherlands shares land borders with Germany and Belgium, and Switzerland is not a neighboring country.  This highlights the need for accurate knowledge of European geography.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Netherlands shares maritime borders with several countries, but Ukraine is not among them.  Ukraine is a landlocked country, so it cannot have a maritime border with the Netherlands. This error demonstrates a lack of understanding of maritime boundaries and geographical locations.


**14. With reference to the Hindu Kush Himalaya region, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Amu Darya River originates from the Hindu Kush Himalaya.
2.  Vietnam is one of the countries located within the Hindu Kush Himalaya region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vietnam is located in Southeast Asia and is not part of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region.  This error demonstrates a lack of geographical knowledge regarding the extent of the Hindu Kush Himalaya.


**15. With reference to the states of India that share a border with Bangladesh, consider the following statements:**

1.  West Bengal and Tripura are the only two states of India that share a border with Bangladesh.
2.  Assam and Meghalaya share a maritime boundary with Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Several Indian states share a border with Bangladesh, including West Bengal, Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam, and Mizoram.  The statement incorrectly limits the number of bordering states, demonstrating a lack of knowledge about India's eastern border.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Assam and Meghalaya share *land* borders with Bangladesh.  Bangladesh shares a maritime boundary with India, but Assam and Meghalaya's boundaries with Bangladesh are land-based. Confusing land and maritime boundaries shows a lack of precision in geographical understanding.


**16. With reference to the Alaknanda River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alaknanda River is a headstream of the Yamuna River.
2.  The Alaknanda River meets the Pindar River at Karanprayag.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alaknanda River is one of the two main headstreams of the *Ganga River*, not the Yamuna River.  Confusing the headstreams of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers indicates a lack of knowledge of Indian river systems.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alaknanda River does indeed meet the Pindar River at Karanprayag.  This demonstrates knowledge of the geography of the upper Ganga basin.


**17. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Anamudi is the highest peak in the Western Ghats.
2.  Most of the peninsular rivers originate in the Eastern Ghats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Anamudi is indeed the highest peak in the Western Ghats. This demonstrates knowledge of the Western Ghats' geography.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Most of the peninsular rivers originate in the *Western Ghats*, not the Eastern Ghats. The Western Ghats are higher and more continuous, providing a significant source of water for many peninsular rivers. The statement incorrectly identifies the source of the rivers, revealing a misunderstanding of peninsular India's hydrology.


**18. With reference to the Mount Ibu, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Ibu is a dormant volcano.
2. Mount Ibu is located in Malaysia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are a subject of a territorial dispute between Japan and China, with the USA implicitly supporting Japan's claim through its security alliance.  This highlights the geopolitical significance of these islands in the East China Sea.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Senkaku Islands are located in the *East China Sea*, not the South China Sea.  This is a significant geographical error.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the election of the Deputy Speaker:**

1. The Deputy Speaker is elected by a special majority in the Lok Sabha.
2. Conventionally, the Deputy Speaker is selected from the ruling party.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, employing misleading information and plausible distractors to challenge the examinee's factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to the geographical features of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, consider the following statements:**

1. The HKH mountains extend approximately 3,500 km across eight countries, originating ten major river systems, including the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra, which collectively provide freshwater to nearly half the world's population.
2.  The Amu Darya river system, originating in the Pamir Knot, is one of the ten crucial river systems flowing through the HKH region, irrigating a significant portion of the arid regions of Central Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the HKH region does indeed extend approximately 3,500 km across eight countries and originates ten major river systems including the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra,  the claim that these rivers provide freshwater to nearly *half* the world's population is an exaggeration. The text states they provide water to almost one-fourth of the world's population.  This significant difference makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Amu Darya river system is accurately listed among the ten major river systems originating in the HKH region.  The Pamir Knot is a key source for several rivers in Central Asia, and the Amu Darya does indeed irrigate significant portions of this arid region.  The statement correctly reflects a key geographical feature and its impact.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the scale of the HKH river systems' impact or incorrectly attribute a river system's origin.


**2. With reference to the Indo-Bangladesh border, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 4,097 km Indo-Bangladesh border shares a significant length with West Bengal (approximately 2,217 km), Assam (263 km), Meghalaya (443 km), Tripura (856 km), and Mizoram (318 km), characterized by a predominantly mountainous terrain presenting considerable natural obstacles to border management.
2. The entire stretch of the Indo-Bangladesh border, traversing diverse geographical features including plains, riverine belts, hills, and jungles, presents a relatively porous border due to the lack of significant natural barriers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the border's length with each state is largely accurate, however, the assertion that the terrain is predominantly mountainous and presents considerable natural obstacles is false. The text explicitly states that the border has "hardly any natural obstacles."  This makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct and accurately describes the diverse and largely unobstructed nature of the Indo-Bangladesh border. The mention of plains, riverine belts, hills, and jungles reflects the reality of the terrain, and the statement correctly highlights the lack of significant natural barriers leading to border porosity. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the border's terrain or incorrectly describe its permeability.


**3. With reference to Estonia's geopolitical situation, consider the following statements:**

1. Estonia, a Baltic country in Northern Europe, is situated between Latvia and Finland, bordering the Gulf of Finland to the north, the Baltic Sea to the west, and Lake Peipus to the east.
2. Estonia, one of the three Baltic states (along with Latvia and Lithuania), is located between Latvia and Russia, bounded by the Gulf of Finland to the north, the Baltic Sea to the west, and Lake Peipus to the east.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the description of Estonia's geographical boundaries (Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, Lake Peipus) is accurate, the statement incorrectly places Estonia between Latvia and *Finland*.  Estonia is actually located between Latvia and Russia. This geographical inaccuracy invalidates the statement.

Statement 2 is entirely correct. It correctly identifies Estonia's location relative to Latvia and Russia, and accurately lists its bordering water bodies. The inclusion of Estonia among the Baltic states (along with Latvia and Lithuania) is also accurate.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent Estonia's location or its neighboring countries.


**4. With reference to the locations mentioned in the provided text, consider the following statements:**

1. Saipan, the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, is located in the Caribbean Sea, a US commonwealth in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 70 km north of Guam.
2. Lake Natron, a crucial breeding ground for lesser flamingos, is a saline-alkaline lake situated in the East African Rift Valley, in Northern Tanzania, and is designated as a Ramsar site of international importance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies Saipan as the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands and its proximity to Guam.  However, it mistakenly places Saipan in the *Caribbean Sea*.  Saipan is located in the *western Pacific Ocean*, as correctly stated later in the text. This major geographical error makes the statement wrong.

Statement 2 is completely accurate.  It correctly identifies Lake Natron's location (Northern Tanzania, East African Rift Valley), its ecological significance (lesser flamingo breeding ground), and its Ramsar site designation. The description of the lake as saline-alkaline is also accurate. The other options are incorrect due to the erroneous placement of Saipan.


**5. With reference to the "Agnipath Scheme," consider the following statements:**

1. The Agnipath Scheme, introduced in 2022, is also known as the "Tour of Duty" scheme, recruiting candidates between the ages of 17.5 and 23 years for a four-year tenure, with 50% of recruits being retained for regular service.
2.  The Agnipath Scheme, implemented in 2022, is also called the "Tour of Duty" scheme, and recruits candidates aged 18 to 23 years for a four-year engagement; at the end of which, 25% of recruits are retained for 15 years of regular service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the scheme's name and implementation year are correct, the age range and percentage of retained recruits are inaccurate. The age range is 17.5 to 21 years, and only 25% are retained, not 50%.  These factual errors make the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 correctly states the name, implementation year, age range (though the upper limit is slightly off – it's 21, not 23), the length of engagement (four years), and the percentage of retained Agniveers (25%).  The slight discrepancy in the upper age limit is not significant enough to invalidate the statement in a UPSC context where precise dates are not always the focus.  The other options are incorrect because they contain inaccuracies regarding the scheme's details.


**6. With reference to the "Air of the Anthropocene" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Air of the Anthropocene" initiative is a global project using traditional photographic techniques and air quality sensors to document air pollution levels, implemented across several countries, including India, Ethiopia, and the UK.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies the initiative's global scope and its use of air quality sensors. However, it incorrectly states that *traditional photographic techniques* are employed. The initiative uses light painting, a specialized photographic technique, not traditional photography. This makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. It accurately describes the use of light painting and air quality sensors for visualizing pollution levels. The mention of India, Ethiopia, and the UK as locations where the initiative has been implemented is also correct.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the photographic techniques used in the initiative.

1. Under PMAY-Gramin, beneficiaries in plain states receive financial assistance of ₹1.20 lakh, while those in hilly states receive ₹1.30 lakh; under PMAY-Urban, ₹3 lakh is provided under the Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) vertical for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS).
2. PMAY-Gramin provides a financial assistance of ₹1.30 lakh to beneficiaries in both plain and hilly states, while PMAY-Urban offers ₹3 lakh under the Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) vertical, exclusively for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements 1 and 2 contain inaccuracies regarding the financial assistance amounts under PMAY-Gramin and the beneficiary criteria under PMAY-Urban. The provided text states that the amounts are incorrect, and the AHP vertical is not exclusively for EWS.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.  The options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they incorrectly assume that one or both statements are correct.  The correct answer highlights the need for precise knowledge of government schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements link the eSakhsya app to unrelated functions. While the app may have some relevance to digital literacy and potentially even to crime scene documentation, the provided text does not explicitly support either of these claims.  Neither statement can be definitively confirmed as correct.  The other options are thus incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's ability to avoid making unsupported assumptions.


**12. With reference to ULLAS-Nav Bharat Saaksharta Karyakram (ULLAS-NILP), consider the following statements:**

1. ULLAS-NILP is a centrally sponsored scheme aiming for 100% functional literacy in primary schools, with Ladakh being the first Union Territory to achieve this under the program.
2. ULLAS-NILP is a state-sponsored scheme focusing on foundational literacy, critical life skills, and vocational skills for adults aged 15 and above, with Ladakh as the first Union Territory to achieve full functional literacy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions Ladakh's achievement, it incorrectly states that ULLAS-NILP is a *centrally* sponsored scheme targeting *primary school* children.  The text clearly indicates that it's a *state-sponsored* program focused on *adults* aged 15 and above.  This makes the statement factually incorrect.

Statement 2 accurately describes ULLAS-NILP's target group (adults 15+), its focus areas (foundational literacy, life skills, vocational skills), and Ladakh's achievement.  The other options are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the scheme's sponsorship or target demographic.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) scheme, launched in June 2015, solely focuses on providing affordable housing to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) families with an annual income below ₹3 lakh.
2.  Under PMAY-U, the Central government provides a fixed central assistance of ₹1.5 lakh for all four verticals: Beneficiary Led Construction (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMAY-U primarily targets EWS families, it also extends its benefits to Low Income Group (LIG) and Middle Income Group (MIG) families through the CLSS vertical.  The income limits for LIG and MIG are higher than ₹3 lakh.  The scheme's focus is not solely on EWS beneficiaries.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The central assistance under PMAY-U varies across verticals.  It is ₹1.0 lakh under ISSR and ₹1.5 lakh for AHP and BLC.  The amount is not uniform across all four verticals.  This difference in funding mechanisms is a crucial aspect of the scheme's design to cater to diverse housing needs and implementation strategies.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMFBY is a demand-driven scheme, mandatory for all states and farmers, offering comprehensive crop insurance from pre-sowing to post-harvest.
2.  Under PMFBY, the premium contribution is fixed at 5% of the sum assured for all crops, irrespective of the actuarial premium rate (APR) set by insurance companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMFBY is indeed a demand-driven scheme, but participation is voluntary for both states and farmers, not mandatory.  The voluntary nature allows states to tailor the scheme to their specific agricultural contexts and priorities.  Further, while PMFBY aims for comprehensive coverage, the specifics of coverage can vary.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The premium contribution under PMFBY is not a fixed 5% for all crops. The premium varies depending on the type of crop and is capped at a percentage of the sum assured or the APR, whichever is lower. The variable premium structure reflects the varying risk profiles of different crops and the actuarial principles underlying the scheme's design.  The flexibility in premium contribution is a key feature of the scheme.


**3. With reference to the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT 2.0), consider the following statements:**

1. AMRUT 2.0, launched in 2015, aims to provide 100% sewerage coverage in all statutory towns and 100% water supply coverage in 500 AMRUT cities by 2025-26.
2. Under AMRUT 2.0, funding is entirely provided through a World Bank loan, ensuring financial sustainability and minimizing the burden on the Indian government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AMRUT 2.0 aims for universal water supply coverage in all statutory towns and 100% sewerage coverage in 500 AMRUT cities. However, the timeline is until 2025-26, not solely 2025. The original AMRUT was launched in 2015, but AMRUT 2.0 is a continuation and enhancement of the program, not a separate launch in 2015.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  AMRUT 2.0 employs outcome-based funding, not solely reliant on World Bank loans. While the World Bank loan was a component of Atal Bhujal Yojana, it is not the sole funding source for AMRUT 2.0.  The scheme incorporates a mix of central government budgetary support and outcome-based funding for cities, promoting financial accountability and efficient resource allocation.


**4. With reference to the District Mineral Foundation (DMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DMF utilizes funds to undertake projects in the high-priority sectors (at least 70% of funds) which directly address the welfare needs of people affected by mining activities, including drinking water supply, environmental preservation and healthcare.
2.  The DMF is mandated to exclusively focus on activities guided by the 'polluter pays principle' to ensure environmental restoration and compensation for damages caused by mining.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. DMFs are indeed tasked with utilizing at least 70% of their funds for projects that directly benefit communities affected by mining. These high-priority sectors include drinking water, environmental protection, healthcare, education, and welfare initiatives.  This focus on direct benefits ensures that the positive impacts of mining are felt by the affected populations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While environmental restoration is a crucial component of DMF activities, it's not the *exclusive* focus. The 'polluter pays principle' is not the sole guiding principle.  DMF funds can be used for a wider range of development projects in mining-affected areas, reflecting a broader approach to sustainable development and community well-being.  The balance between environmental restoration and broader community development is a key consideration in the DMF's operational framework.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) scheme, launched in 2008-09 as Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP), exclusively targets the development of infrastructure in minority-concentrated areas with a minority population exceeding 50% within a 15 km radius.
2.  PMJVK provides demand-driven financial assistance for infrastructure projects, prioritizing community assets and ensuring the benefits are exclusively restricted to the notified minority communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PMJVK does focus on minority-concentrated areas, the threshold is 25% of the population within a 15 km radius, not 50%.  The lower threshold allows for a wider reach and inclusion of areas with a significant but not overwhelmingly dominant minority population.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. PMJVK provides demand-driven financial assistance for infrastructure projects, focusing on community assets. However, the benefits are not exclusively limited to notified minority communities.  The infrastructure developed under PMJVK is meant to be accessible to all communities residing within the designated catchment area.  This inclusive approach is designed to promote social harmony and shared development in the targeted areas.


**6. With reference to the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), consider the following statements:**

1.  JJM, a centrally sponsored scheme, aims to provide every rural household with a functional household tap connection (FHTC) by 2024, exclusively focusing on providing safe drinking water.
2.  Under JJM, 100% of the funding is provided by the central government, ensuring complete financial coverage and minimizing the burden on state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While JJM's primary goal is to provide FHTCs to every rural household by 2024,  it also includes the provision of safe drinking water connections to schools, anganwadis, and other community facilities.  It's not solely focused on household connections.

Statement 2 is incorrect. JJM is a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning that the funding is shared between the central and state governments. The funding is not 100% borne by the central government.  The cost-sharing arrangement encourages state government participation and ownership in the program's implementation, ensuring its effectiveness and sustainability.  The exact cost-sharing ratio may vary depending on the specific state's financial capabilities and needs.


**7. With reference to the Namami Gange Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Namami Gange Yojana, a centrally sponsored scheme, focuses solely on the rejuvenation of the River Ganga, excluding its tributaries.
2.  The Namami Gange Yojana is entirely funded through budgetary allocations from the Indian government, without any external assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the primary focus of Namami Gange is the rejuvenation of the River Ganga, it also encompasses the cleaning and conservation of its major tributaries.  The river basin approach adopted by the scheme recognizes the interconnectedness of the Ganga's ecosystem and the need for a holistic approach to its rejuvenation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Namami Gange Yojana does receive external assistance, notably through World Bank loans. This funding collaboration reflects the scheme's scale and the international recognition of the importance of the Ganga's conservation.  The combination of domestic and international funding sources underscores the multi-faceted nature of the project and its significance for environmental protection.


**8.  Consider the following statements:**

1. The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) vertical under PMAY-U is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, while the other three verticals are Central Sector Schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CLSS vertical under PMAY-U is a Central Sector Scheme, while the other three verticals (BLC, AHP, and ISSR) are Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  This distinction reflects the different funding and implementation mechanisms employed for each vertical. Central Sector Schemes are fully funded by the central government, while Centrally Sponsored Schemes involve cost-sharing between the central and state governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CLSS vertical is implemented through Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) and other financial institutions like NHB. The other three verticals are implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and other agencies at the state and local levels. The division of implementation responsibilities between the ministry and HUDCO (and other agencies) reflects the specific requirements of each vertical.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Oman does share a maritime border with Iran and possesses a young population, leading to a demographic dividend.  While Oman exports oil,  it's not explicitly stated as "substantial" in the provided data, and the emphasis on this aspect in the statement is a potential distractor. The statement links several correct facts to create a potentially misleading overall assertion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Saudi Arabia does border Oman and India has launched the PM Gati Shakti program, there's no information linking Saudi Arabia's initiatives directly to this Indian program or to enhanced connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  The statement attempts to connect unrelated pieces of information to create a false impression.  The connection between Saudi Arabia and the IMEEC (India-Middle East-Economic Corridor) is plausible but not explicitly stated in the provided data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India does indeed share its longest land border with Bangladesh.  The information about the increase in Bangladesh's mangrove cover is a plausible distractor, as mangrove ecosystems are vital to coastal regions, and the statement correctly connects Bangladesh and its coastal regions.  However, the specific detail about a recent significant increase in mangrove cover is not directly verifiable from the provided information.

Statement 2 is also correct.  India does share a shorter, disputed border with Afghanistan. The detail regarding a recent surge in Afghanistan's opium production is a true fact,  and the assertion that this threatens regional stability is a reasonable inference.  While the exact timing of this "recent" surge is not provided, the overall statement is factually accurate in linking the two countries and a significant issue related to Afghanistan.



**3. With reference to the Five Eyes Intelligence Sharing Alliance, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Five Eyes alliance consists of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.  The statement falsely claims the inclusion of India and the Philippines and falsely asserts an expanded recruitment drive to include these countries. This is a significant distortion of the facts designed to mislead.

Statement 2 is correct. Japan is not a member of the Five Eyes alliance, but the statement correctly points out its significant cooperation with the alliance members on various security issues, making the statement factually accurate.



**4. With reference to India's foreign policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's Act East Policy, aimed at strengthening its relations with Southeast Asia, has recently been revised to include a stronger focus on economic cooperation with the European Union (EU) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
2. India's Neighbourhood First Policy, prioritizing relations with its immediate neighbors, has faced challenges due to recent geopolitical instability in Afghanistan and Myanmar, both bordering India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act East Policy primarily focuses on Southeast Asia. While India does have economic relations with the EU and GCC,  there is no evidence in the provided information suggesting a recent revision of the Act East Policy to explicitly include a stronger focus on the EU and GCC.  This statement attempts to combine several true components to create a false statement.

Statement 2 is correct. India does have a Neighbourhood First Policy, and recent instability in Afghanistan and Myanmar (both bordering India) has indeed posed challenges to this policy. This is a straightforward and accurate statement.

Hydroxyurea, a myelosuppressive agent, is used to treat both sickle cell disease and thalassemia, albeit with limited efficacy in some cases.
2.  India bears the highest burden of sickle cell disease in South Asia, with over 20 million individuals affected. The National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission aims to provide accessible and affordable care and eliminate the disease by 2047, by implementing a three-pillar health strategy focusing on health promotion, prevention, and holistic management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the pathogenesis and treatment of sickle cell disease. The abnormal hemoglobin leads to the characteristic sickle shape of red blood cells, impairing blood flow and causing a range of complications. Hydroxyurea is indeed used in its treatment, although its effectiveness can vary depending on the patient and disease severity. The statement also correctly mentions that Hydroxyurea is used for both Sickle cell disease and Thalassemia.

Statement 2 correctly highlights India's high prevalence of sickle cell disease and the objectives of the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission. The three-pillar strategy mentioned is also accurately reflected in the provided text.  Both statements provide correct information on the disease and related initiatives.


**5. With reference to Gene Therapy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gene therapy techniques can involve replacing a faulty gene with a healthy copy, inactivating a disease-causing gene, or introducing a new gene to help combat a disease. CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a prominent example of a tool used in gene therapy.
2.  Gene therapy has shown promise in treating inherited genetic diseases such as haemophilia and sickle cell disease, as well as acquired disorders like leukemia.  Germline gene therapy, which alters the germline cells (egg or sperm), is widely practiced and accepted globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly outlines the mechanisms of gene therapy.  Replacing, inactivating, or introducing genes are all valid approaches used in gene therapy, and CRISPR-Cas9 is indeed a powerful gene-editing tool used in this field.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While gene therapy shows promise in treating both inherited and acquired diseases as mentioned, the claim that germline gene therapy is widely practiced and accepted globally is incorrect. Germline gene therapy raises significant ethical concerns due to its heritable nature, and its application is strictly regulated or even banned in many countries including India due to ethical and safety concerns.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**6. Concerning Black Holes, consider the following statements:**

1. A black hole is a region of spacetime with extremely strong gravity, formed by the collapse of a massive star at the end of its life cycle.  Its center is a gravitational singularity, a point of infinite density where the laws of physics as we currently understand them break down.
2. Black holes possess a well-defined surface, similar to planets or stars, which is called the event horizon.  Hawking radiation, a theoretical phenomenon proposed by Stephen Hawking, describes the emission of radiation from the surface of black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the formation and nature of a black hole.  The collapse of a massive star under its own gravity leads to the formation of a region of spacetime with such strong gravity that not even light can escape. The singularity at the center represents a point of infinite density, a concept that challenges our current understanding of physics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Black holes do *not* have a well-defined surface in the traditional sense. The event horizon is a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape, but it is not a physical surface.  While Hawking radiation is a theoretical concept suggesting that black holes emit radiation, this radiation originates from the vicinity of the event horizon, not from the event horizon itself as a surface.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**7. With reference to Nanotechnology, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nanoparticles exhibit unique properties, differing from their bulk counterparts, primarily due to their extremely large surface area to volume ratio.  These unique properties are exploited in various applications across numerous fields.
2.  Nanoparticles can be synthesized through both "top-down" approaches, which involve breaking down larger materials into nanoparticles, and "bottom-up" approaches, which involve assembling nanoparticles from individual atoms or molecules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The exceptionally high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles is a key factor responsible for their unique physical, chemical, optical, and other properties.  These unique properties are significantly different from the bulk material and are the basis of many nanotechnology applications.

Statement 2 is also correct. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches are valid and widely used methods for synthesizing nanoparticles. Top-down methods involve breaking down larger materials (e.g., milling, lithography), while bottom-up methods involve assembling nanoparticles from smaller units (e.g., chemical synthesis, self-assembly).  Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the desired nanoparticle properties and scale of production.  Thus, both statements are correct.


**8.  Regarding Milgromian dynamics (MOND) theory, consider the following statements:**

1.  MOND theory, proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1982, suggests modifications to Newtonian dynamics to explain galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter, primarily by altering gravitational behavior at extremely large distances from celestial objects.
2. MOND theory successfully predicts galaxy rotation curves without the need for dark matter; however, it faces limitations, particularly at smaller length scales where Newtonian gravity remains strongly preferred.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct in describing MOND. It proposes modifications to Newtonian gravity, particularly at low accelerations (which are prevalent at the edges of galaxies), to explain galactic rotation curves without needing dark matter.  However, the statement is slightly imprecise by emphasizing "extremely large distances".  It's more accurate to say that MOND modifies gravity at *low accelerations*, regardless of the specific distance, which happens to be the case at the edges of galaxies.

Statement 2 is also correct. MOND successfully explains galaxy rotation curves without dark matter in many instances, a significant achievement. However, it does have limitations, especially at smaller length scales (below about a light year) where Newtonian gravity provides better predictions.  This limitation is a key area of ongoing research and debate in astrophysics.  Therefore, both statements are substantially correct, although statement 1 could benefit from a more precise phrasing.


**9. With reference to the Aditya-L1 mission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aditya-L1 mission is India’s first space-based solar observatory, positioned at the Lagrangian point L1, primarily to study the Sun’s chromosphere and corona continuously and uninterruptedly.
2.  Positioning Aditya-L1 in a halo orbit around the L1 point offers several advantages over a Low Earth Orbit (LEO), including unobstructed continuous solar observation, a stable platform for helioseismology, and the ability to directly sample the solar wind and particles outside Earth's magnetosphere.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Aditya-L1 mission's primary objective and location.  It is indeed India's first dedicated solar mission, positioned at the L1 Lagrange point to enable continuous observation of the Sun's chromosphere and corona without interruption from Earth's orbit.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the advantages of the L1 halo orbit. The L1 point provides a stable vantage point for continuous solar observation, unaffected by Earth's rotation or its magnetosphere.  This is advantageous for helioseismology (studying the Sun's internal structure through oscillations) and in-situ sampling of the solar wind.  The stable orbit also facilitates continuous communication with ground stations.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the Aditya-L1 mission.


**10. With reference to portable optical atomic clocks, consider the following statements:**

1.

The portable optical atomic clocks achieve higher accuracy than traditional caesium clocks at the cost of reduced portability.
2.  India's NAVIC satellite navigation system currently relies on portable optical atomic clocks for its timekeeping, representing a significant advancement in the accuracy of India's indigenous navigation system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly differentiates traditional atomic clocks from portable optical atomic clocks. Traditional caesium clocks operate at microwave frequencies, while portable optical atomic clocks use optical frequencies and different elements.  While portable optical atomic clocks aim for higher accuracy for maritime applications, the statement that they achieve higher accuracy *at the cost of reduced portability* compared to caesium clocks is slightly misleading. The trade-off is more about balancing accuracy and portability, with optical clocks offering increased accuracy but requiring more sophisticated technology, making them more complex to miniaturize for true portability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's NAVIC system does not currently utilize portable optical atomic clocks. While the development of such portable clocks represents a significant advancement in timekeeping technology, their integration into NAVIC is not yet a reality. Therefore, only statement 1 is substantially correct.

**1. With reference to the impact of the Green Revolution in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Green Revolution primarily focused on increasing the yield of wheat and rice, leading to a significant rise in their production.  
2. While increasing food grain production, the Green Revolution also led to a substantial increase in the production of pulses and oilseeds to meet the growing domestic demand.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Green Revolution in India, primarily launched in the 1960s, was a significant agricultural development program.  Its core focus was on enhancing the productivity of cereal crops, particularly wheat and rice. The introduction of high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds, coupled with increased irrigation, fertilizer use, and improved agricultural practices, led to a dramatic increase in the production of these two staple crops. This significantly improved food security and contributed to India's self-sufficiency in food grains.  However, the Green Revolution's impact on pulses and oilseeds was less pronounced. While some improvements were seen, the increase in their production did not match the scale of the gains achieved in wheat and rice. This disproportionate focus on cereals contributed to nutritional imbalances in the Indian diet, as pulses and oilseeds are crucial sources of protein and essential fats.  Therefore, statement 1 accurately reflects the primary focus of the Green Revolution, while statement 2 is incorrect due to the limited impact on pulses and oilseeds production.

1. The NFSA aims to provide subsidized food grains to approximately two-thirds of India's population, covering the poorest segments of society.
2. The NFSA guarantees a fixed quantity of food grains per person per month, irrespective of the beneficiary's income level or location within the country.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act, 2013, is a landmark legislation aimed at ensuring food security in India.  The Act intends to provide subsidized food grains to a significant portion of the population, primarily targeting the most vulnerable and food-insecure sections. The coverage under the NFSA is substantial, aiming to reach approximately 67% of the Indian population. However, the quantity of food grains provided under the NFSA is not uniformly fixed across all beneficiaries. The allocation varies depending on factors such as age group, location, and state-specific variations in the implementation of the scheme.  Furthermore, while the NFSA prioritizes the poorest, the eligibility criteria are not solely based on income.  Other factors such as land ownership and social categories also play a role in determining eligibility. Therefore, statement 1 correctly captures the NFSA's broad goal and target population, while statement 2 is incorrect because of the variable nature of food grain allocation.


**3. With reference to India's foreign policy during the Cold War era, consider the following statements:**

2.  India's Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) participation actively involved military alliances with both the US and USSR, balancing power dynamics during the Cold War.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India's foreign policy during the Cold War era was significantly shaped by its commitment to Non-Alignment. This policy, championed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was a cornerstone of India's international relations.  The core principle of Non-Alignment was to maintain strategic autonomy, avoiding formal alliances with either the capitalist bloc (led by the USA) or the communist bloc (led by the USSR).  This approach allowed India to pursue its independent foreign policy objectives, balancing its relationships with both superpowers while prioritizing national interests.  However, India's Non-Alignment did not translate into military alliances with either superpower. While India received aid and support from both the US and the USSR at different times, it carefully avoided entering into formal military pacts.  Its participation in NAM was crucial in fostering a platform for other developing countries to pursue similar paths of non-alignment.  Therefore, statement 1 correctly identifies the driving force behind India's Non-Alignment, while statement 2 is incorrect due to the absence of military alliances with either the US or the USSR.

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the IUCN Red List does use the categories mentioned, the classification of the Western Hoolock Gibbon and Asiatic Cheetah are reversed. The Western Hoolock Gibbon is classified as "Endangered," not "Vulnerable," and the Asiatic Cheetah is "Critically Endangered," not "Endangered."  This demonstrates the importance of precise knowledge of species conservation status.

Statement 2 is also partially incorrect. While the Red List is a global inventory updated regularly,  the classifications of the Indian Pangolin and Dhole are inaccurate. The Indian Pangolin is listed as "Endangered," not "Critically Endangered," and the Dhole is listed as "Endangered," not "Critically Endangered." The inaccuracies in both statements highlight the need for careful verification of IUCN Red List classifications.  The complexity of the assessment process and the constant changes in species status emphasize the dynamic nature of conservation efforts.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The  *Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972*  lists the Indian elephant under Schedule I, providing it the highest degree of legal protection, while the Gharial is listed under Schedule IV.
2.  The  *Environment Protection Act, 1986*  regulates Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs), mandating a 10km radius around protected areas as per the National Wildlife Action Plan (2002-2016).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The *Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972* indeed places the Indian elephant in Schedule I, offering the highest level of protection.  The Gharial is correctly listed under Schedule IV, indicating a different level of protection.  This highlights the varying degrees of legal protection afforded to different species under Indian law, reflecting their conservation status and vulnerability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the *Environment Protection Act, 1986* does regulate ESZs, the 10km radius stipulation originates from the National Wildlife Action Plan (2002-2016), not the EPA.  The EPA provides the overarching legal framework for environmental protection, but the specific guidelines for ESZ establishment and the 10km radius are detailed in the National Wildlife Action Plan.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the interplay between different environmental legislations in India.  Furthermore, the Supreme Court later issued clarifications and modifications to the 10km rule, which further complicates the statement's accuracy.


**2. With reference to biofuels, consider the following statements:**

1.  Biodiesel production primarily utilizes rapeseed oil as a feedstock, and the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana specifically supports the use of biodiesel in the transport sector.
2.  The Repurpose Used Cooking Oil (RUCO) scheme contributes to biodiesel production, while genetically modified organisms (GMOs) play no role in first-generation biofuel production.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana aims to promote the use of biofuels generally, including ethanol and biodiesel, in the transport sector, but it is not exclusively focused on biodiesel.  This highlights the diverse sources and applications of biofuels.

Statement 2 is correct. The RUCO scheme effectively recycles used cooking oil, a significant source for biodiesel production, thereby reducing waste and promoting sustainability.  First-generation biofuels primarily rely on conventional feedstocks like vegetable oils and sugars, and genetic modification is not a defining characteristic of this generation. This statement accurately reflects the sources and processes involved in biofuel production.


**3. With reference to the IUCN, consider the following statements:**

1. The IUCN Red List categorizes species into different threat levels, including Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable, based solely on population size.
2. The IUCN publishes the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, which utilizes data to quantify extinction risks and the potential of specific actions to contribute to international conservation targets,  a metric called STAR.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While population size is a significant factor in determining IUCN Red List categories, it is not the *sole* criterion. Other factors, such as the rate of population decline, geographic range, habitat quality, and threats to the species, are also considered.  Oversimplifying the assessment criteria misrepresents the complexity of the IUCN's methodology and its scientific rigor.

Statement 2 is correct. The IUCN's Red List is a comprehensive database of the conservation status of various species. The STAR metric, developed in partnership with other organizations, indeed utilizes Red List data to assess extinction risks and the potential impact of conservation actions.  This illustrates the IUCN's role in providing data-driven insights for conservation planning and policy-making.


**4. With reference to the  *Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972*, consider the following statements:**

1.  Schedule II of the Act regulates the hunting of species listed in CITES Appendices, while Schedule IV regulates the trade in ivory.
2.  The Act establishes the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau to enforce its provisions, and it mandates the creation of a Wildlife Advisory Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Schedule II of the *Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972*  regulates hunting of certain species, but not exclusively those listed in CITES Appendices. CITES Appendices and Schedule IV have separate and distinct listings and regulations. The trade in ivory is prohibited under the Act, but not specifically regulated in Schedule IV.  This error demonstrates a lack of precision in understanding the Act's scheduling system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does establish the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau for enforcement and mandates the constitution of a Wildlife Advisory Board. This shows the Act's comprehensive approach to wildlife conservation, encompassing both enforcement and advisory mechanisms.

2. The  *Environment Protection Act, 1986*  is the primary legal instrument that governs the implementation of the Miyawaki method in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Miyawaki method is accurately described, emphasizing its rapid growth and focus on native species diversity.  This reflects a fundamental understanding of ecological restoration principles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Miyawaki method's implementation in India is not directly governed by the *Environment Protection Act, 1986*.  While the EPA provides a broader framework for environmental protection, there isn't a specific provision dictating this afforestation technique.  This highlights the lack of a singular, overarching legal framework for all afforestation techniques within India.  Different governmental agencies and policies might influence the adoption and implementation of the method.


These questions aim to test not only factual recall but also the ability to analyze and evaluate information, identify subtle inaccuracies, and understand the nuances of environmental legislation and conservation practices in India.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the impact of the Green Revolution in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Green Revolution led to a significant increase in the production of wheat and rice, making India self-sufficient in food grains.
2. The Green Revolution primarily benefited large landowners, contributing to increased income inequality in the agricultural sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Green Revolution, initiated in the 1960s, significantly impacted Indian agriculture.  Statement 1 is accurate because the introduction of high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds, coupled with increased irrigation and fertilizer use, resulted in a substantial rise in wheat and rice production. This boosted India's food security, reducing dependence on imports and alleviating widespread hunger. However, statement 2 is also correct. The Green Revolution's benefits were unevenly distributed.  Large farmers, with access to resources like irrigation and credit, reaped the most substantial gains. Smaller farmers often lacked the resources to adopt new technologies, exacerbating existing inequalities in land ownership and income. This disparity widened the gap between rich and poor farmers, leading to social and economic imbalances within the agricultural sector.  Therefore, both statements reflect accurate aspects of the Green Revolution's complex legacy in India.


**2. With reference to the Kafala system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kafala system, prevalent in several Middle Eastern countries, grants extensive rights to migrant workers, including the right to change employers without their sponsor's consent.
2.  The Kafala system is criticized for its potential to lead to exploitation and human rights abuses against migrant workers due to its restrictive nature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kafala system is a sponsorship system for migrant workers primarily used in several Middle Eastern countries. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Kafala system is widely criticized for its exploitative nature. Under this system, migrant workers are tied to a single sponsor, usually their employer, who controls their legal status and ability to change jobs or leave the country.  Workers often lack the freedom to negotiate wages or working conditions and face the risk of abuse and exploitation without recourse.  Statement 2 is correct as numerous human rights organizations and international bodies have documented significant human rights violations associated with the Kafala system, including forced labor, wage theft, and restricted movement. The system's inherent power imbalance between sponsors and workers makes it vulnerable to abuse, highlighting serious ethical and legal concerns.


**3. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The NPCI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), responsible for operating several retail payment systems in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NPCI plays a crucial role in India's financial infrastructure. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NPCI is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the RBI. While the RBI plays a significant role in overseeing the NPCI, it is owned and operated by a group of major Indian banks, with the RBI having a supervisory role. Statement 2 is correct. The UPI is a mobile-based payment system developed and operated by the NPCI.  It has revolutionized digital payments in India, offering a convenient and cost-effective way for individuals and businesses to transfer funds and make payments through mobile devices.  The UPI's success is attributed to its ease of use, wide acceptance, and integration with various banking platforms.


**4. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), assesses gender parity across four key dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.
2.  The 2024 report indicates that global gender parity has been fully achieved across all 146 countries included in the report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The WEF's Global Gender Gap Report annually measures gender equality across various nations. Statement 1 is correct. The report indeed assesses gender parity across four key dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment. These dimensions provide a comprehensive overview of gender equality, encompassing economic opportunities, educational access, health disparities, and political representation.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The report consistently reveals that while progress has been made in some areas, global gender parity remains far from fully achieved.  The report provides a percentage score reflecting the gap's closure, and this score consistently falls short of 100%, indicating ongoing inequalities across various countries and dimensions.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the report's content and methodology.


**5. Consider the following statements about the India Post:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India Post has a long and significant history within India's communication and postal services. Statement 1 is incorrect. The India Post Office Act of 1854 was enacted under the administration of Lord Dalhousie, not Lord Curzon.  Lord Dalhousie's tenure as Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856 saw extensive administrative reforms, including the establishment of a more unified and efficient postal system. Statement 2 is correct. India Post boasts a vast and extensive postal network that is widely recognized as the world's largest, surpassing other national postal systems in terms of its physical reach, service points, and coverage, particularly in rural areas.  This extensive network plays a vital role in connecting remote and underserved communities.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment provides periodic updates on forest cover and management globally. Statement 1 is incorrect. The GFRA 2020 did not report a net loss of forest cover in India.  Instead, it showed a net gain in forest cover, though this gain was not uniform across all regions of India. Statement 2 is also not entirely accurate in its direct assertion. While the GFRA 2020 acknowledges the importance of community participation in forest management, it doesn't explicitly highlight it as the primary driver of forest cover mitigation in India. The report mentions various factors contributing to changes in forest cover, including government policies, economic activities, and climate change.  Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies or oversimplifications of the GFRA 2020's findings regarding India's forest cover.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WEF's Global Gender Gap Report tracks gender equality progress globally. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 clearly indicates that while significant progress has been made in closing the gender gap across various countries, full gender parity has not been achieved in any country. The report provides a percentage score for each country indicating the extent of the gap closed, and this score consistently falls short of 100 percent across all countries. Statement 2 is correct. Based on the current rate of progress as analyzed in the report, it will take 134 years to achieve full global gender parity. This long timeframe underscores the need for urgent and comprehensive action to accelerate progress towards gender equality.

2. The IPPB's services include basic savings accounts, money transfers, and other financial products, primarily targeting rural and underserved populations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IPPB is a significant financial inclusion initiative in India. Statement 1 is incorrect. The IPPB is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the RBI. It is a Department of Posts undertaking under the Ministry of Communications, leveraging the extensive network of post offices across India.  The RBI plays a regulatory role in overseeing the IPPB's operations as a payment bank. Statement 2 is correct. The IPPB offers a range of financial services, including basic savings bank accounts, money transfers, micro-loans, and other financial products, primarily aimed at serving rural and underserved populations.  This aligns with the government's broader financial inclusion agenda.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the functioning of India's financial intelligence unit, consider the following statements:**

1. The Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004 under the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
2. FIU-IND directly reports to the Prime Minister's Office, ensuring independence in its operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  FIU-IND was established under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, not the Department of Economic Affairs.  The Department of Revenue is responsible for tax collection and administration, making it a more appropriate oversight body for a financial intelligence unit focused on suspect financial transactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FIU-IND reports directly to the Economic Intelligence Council (EIC), headed by the Finance Minister, not the Prime Minister's Office. While independence is crucial for its function, this independence is ensured through its reporting structure to the EIC, which is a body focused on economic policy and intelligence.  Direct reporting to the PMO would be unusual for such a specialized agency.  The structure ensures both operational independence and accountability to the relevant ministerial authority.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of greenhouse gas emissions:**

1. Deforestation is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the release of stored carbon dioxide.
2. The primary greenhouse gas responsible for sea-level rise is methane, due to its higher global warming potential compared to carbon dioxide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Deforestation significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis; when they are cut down, this stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change.  This is a well-established scientific fact contributing to the overall greenhouse effect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide *over a shorter time frame*, carbon dioxide is the primary driver of long-term warming and sea-level rise.  Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere far longer than methane, leading to a cumulative warming effect that is more significant for sea-level changes.  The statement incorrectly attributes the primary role to methane.


**3. With reference to the  'Ending the Neglect to Attain Sustainable Development Goals: A Roadmap for Neglected Tropical Diseases 2021-2030', consider the following statements:**

1. The roadmap aims for a 50% reduction in the number of people requiring treatment for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) by 2030.
2.  The roadmap primarily focuses on the elimination of NTDs in high-income countries where resources are readily available.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The roadmap sets a far more ambitious target: a 90% reduction in the number of people requiring treatment for NTDs by 2030, not 50%. This reflects the urgency and scale of the challenge posed by NTDs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The roadmap explicitly focuses on reducing the burden of NTDs in low- and middle-income countries, where the majority of the affected population resides.  These are the regions most severely impacted by NTDs due to factors such as poverty, lack of sanitation, and limited access to healthcare.  High-income countries are not the primary focus of this particular initiative.


**4. With reference to the Kafala system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kafala system is primarily used in South Asian countries to regulate the employment of migrant workers.
2.  Under the Kafala system, workers generally have the right to change employers without their sponsor's permission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kafala system is primarily used in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates), as well as Jordan and Lebanon – countries in the Middle East, not South Asia.  These countries have significant populations of migrant workers, many of whom are employed under the Kafala sponsorship system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A core criticism of the Kafala system is that workers typically require their sponsor's (usually their employer's) permission to change jobs, leave the country, or even sometimes to leave their place of employment. This lack of mobility and control over their own employment significantly increases the vulnerability of migrant workers to exploitation.


**5.  With reference to the India Post Office Act of 1854, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act was introduced during the British Raj under the administration of Lord Curzon.
2. The Act established a decentralized postal system, giving individual post offices significant autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The India Post Office Act of 1854 was introduced during Lord Dalhousie's administration, not Lord Curzon's.  Lord Dalhousie implemented significant reforms in various sectors during his tenure as Governor-General of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act actually established a centralized postal system in India, placing the postal services under the authority of a Director General of Post. This centralization aimed to improve efficiency and streamline administration across the vast geographical expanse of British India.  A decentralized system would have been less effective in managing the postal network.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Kavli Prize:**

1. The Kavli Prize is awarded annually in the fields of astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience.
2. The prize is jointly administered by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Kavli Foundation.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kavli Prize is awarded biennially (every two years), not annually, in the fields of astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience. The biennial award schedule reflects the rigorous selection process and the significance of the prize within the scientific community.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kavli Prize is established by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in collaboration with the Kavli Foundation and the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research, not the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The involvement of the Norwegian Academy reflects the country's strong tradition in scientific research and its commitment to international scientific collaboration.


**7. With reference to the  National Statistics Day, consider the following statements:**

1. National Statistics Day is celebrated annually on July 29th to commemorate the birth anniversary of Professor P.C. Mahalanobis.
2. The theme for National Statistics Day 2024 is "Data for Sustainable Development Goals".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. National Statistics Day is celebrated annually on June 29th, not July 29th, to commemorate the birth anniversary of Professor Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis. The date is specifically chosen to honour his significant contributions to the field of statistics in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the day emphasizes the importance of statistics in driving sustainable development, the specific theme for National Statistics Day 2024 was "Use of Data for Decision Making,"  not solely  "Data for Sustainable Development Goals."  The theme highlights the practical application of statistical data in policy formulation and decision-making processes across various sectors.


**8.  With reference to the impact of a carbon tax on agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. Denmark was the first country to implement a carbon tax specifically targeting agricultural emissions.
2. Carbon taxes are designed to increase greenhouse gas emissions by making them more affordable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Denmark announced the introduction of a carbon tax on agriculture, making it the first country to implement such a policy. This tax is a significant step towards addressing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and aligns with the global efforts to mitigate climate change.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Carbon taxes are designed to *reduce* greenhouse gas emissions, not increase them. By increasing the cost of activities that generate carbon emissions, carbon taxes incentivize businesses and individuals to adopt cleaner and more sustainable practices. The aim is to internalize the environmental costs associated with carbon emissions, leading to a reduction in overall emissions.  The statement presents a completely opposite effect.


**9. With reference to the use of bitumen, consider the following statements:**

1. Bitumen is a primary feedstock for biofuel production.
2. Bitumen's binding properties make it suitable for use in road paving and waterproofing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While bio-bitumen can be produced from organic materials, traditional bitumen itself is not a biofuel. Bitumen is a naturally occurring, viscous, black substance derived from petroleum, and it is primarily used in construction and road building.

Statement 2 is correct. Bitumen's adhesive and binding properties make it an essential material in road construction, waterproofing applications, and as a binder in various building materials. Its ability to bind aggregates and create a durable, waterproof surface makes it suitable for various applications.  The statement accurately reflects the primary uses of bitumen.


**10. Consider the following statements about the  CBDT:**

1. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) works under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.
2. The CBDT is responsible for formulating policies related to indirect taxation in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) functions under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.  The Department of Revenue oversees the administration and collection of direct taxes in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CBDT is responsible for formulating policies related to *direct* taxation, not indirect taxation.  Indirect taxes, such as GST, are managed by a different body, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).  The question tests the knowledge of different tax administration bodies in India.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Bal Gangadhar Tilak's political career:**

1.  He consistently advocated for complete independence from British rule, rejecting any form of compromise or dominion status.
2.  His newspaper, *Kesari*, played a crucial role in mobilizing mass support for the Swadeshi movement through its fiery editorials and nationalist propaganda.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Tilak was a prominent figure in the extremist wing of the Indian National Congress, advocating for Swaraj, his stance on complete independence evolved over time.  Initially, his focus was on achieving Swaraj through various means, including constitutional methods and mass mobilization.  His later years saw a stronger emphasis on complete self-rule, but he wasn't entirely unwavering in his rejection of compromise throughout his career.  The demand for complete independence gained momentum later with the rise of more radical leaders within the nationalist movement.

Statement 2 is correct. *Kesari*, the Marathi newspaper founded and edited by Tilak, was instrumental in shaping public opinion and galvanizing support for the Swadeshi movement. Its strong nationalist tone and advocacy for self-reliance played a significant role in mobilizing the masses and challenging British authority.  The newspaper's widespread readership, particularly among the Marathi-speaking population of Maharashtra, made it a powerful tool for disseminating nationalist ideas and fostering a sense of collective identity.


**2. With reference to Bal Gangadhar Tilak's strategies for achieving Swaraj, consider the following statements:**

1. He primarily relied on peaceful and non-violent methods of protest, similar to the approach later adopted by Mahatma Gandhi.
2. He utilized religious festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi and Shivaji Jayanti to promote nationalist sentiments and organize mass gatherings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha heavily emphasized non-violence, Tilak's approach was significantly different.  He advocated for a more assertive and, at times, militant form of nationalism.  He believed in using various methods to achieve Swaraj, including mass mobilization and challenging British authority directly.  His methods weren't exclusively peaceful; he faced numerous arrests and imprisonment for sedition.

Statement 2 is correct.  Tilak masterfully used the popular religious festivals of Ganesh Chaturthi and Shivaji Jayanti to subtly infuse nationalist sentiments into the celebrations. These festivals provided him with a platform to reach a wider audience and unite people under a shared national identity.  By associating these celebrations with nationalist ideals, he effectively bypassed British censorship and mobilized mass support for the nationalist cause.  This strategic use of religious occasions for political mobilization demonstrated his understanding of the socio-religious landscape of India.


**3. With reference to Pingali Venkayaya, consider the following statements:**

1.  He was solely responsible for the final design of the Indian National Flag, without any input or collaboration from other prominent nationalist leaders.
2.  His design, which was initially different from the final adopted version, incorporated elements representing both Hindu and Muslim communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Pingali Venkayya's contribution to the design of the Indian National Flag is significant, he did not work in isolation.  His design was presented to and subsequently modified by the Indian National Congress, with input from Mahatma Gandhi and other key figures. The final version differed in some aspects from Venkayya's original proposal.  The collaborative nature of the flag's design reflects the broader political context of the time and the consensus-building process involved in the creation of a national symbol.

Statement 2 is correct. Venkayya's original design incorporated elements representative of both Hindu and Muslim communities.  This reflected the desire for inclusivity and unity within the diverse Indian population during the struggle for independence.  However, the final adopted version, although retaining some elements of his design, made certain modifications for practical reasons and symbolic representation.


**4. With reference to the Kakori Train Robbery, consider the following statements:**

1. The robbery was primarily motivated by a desire to fund the Hindustan Republican Association's revolutionary activities.
2.  Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Rajendra Lahiri were the only three individuals directly involved in the execution of the robbery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori Train Robbery, a daring act of defiance against British rule, was indeed primarily aimed at securing funds for the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA). The HRA was a revolutionary organization working towards complete independence, and the robbery was seen as a means to finance their activities, including procuring weapons and supporting their underground operations. The act, although condemned by some, was lauded by others as a bold act of rebellion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Rajendra Lahiri were key figures in the Kakori conspiracy, many other individuals were involved in planning, executing, and supporting the robbery. The conspiracy involved a network of revolutionaries, and the participation of many other members was later revealed during investigations.  The trial that followed saw many individuals charged with various levels of involvement.


**5. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The award can only be conferred upon Indian citizens, excluding individuals of foreign nationality.
2.  Recipients are permitted to use the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their name.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Bharat Ratna is primarily awarded to Indian citizens, there have been instances where it has been conferred upon non-Indians in recognition of their exceptional contributions to India.  This highlights the award's recognition beyond national boundaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution explicitly prohibits the use of titles conferred by the state. Therefore, recipients of the Bharat Ratna are not allowed to use the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their name.  However, they are allowed to mention their receipt of the award in their biographical information.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rabindranath Tagore was indeed the first non-European and Asian to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913, primarily for his *Gitanjali*, a collection of poems that showcased his unique blend of spiritual and poetic expression.  This award brought international recognition to Indian literature and solidified Tagore's position as a global literary icon.  His work transcended geographical boundaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Tagore was exposed to Western thought, the primary objective of establishing Visva-Bharati University was to foster a unique blend of Eastern and Western educational ideals.  The university aimed to promote a holistic approach to education, emphasizing both traditional Indian values and modern learning methodologies. It was designed to be a center for cultural exchange and learning with international outlook.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gotipua is a classical dance form originating in Odisha, but it is traditionally performed by young boys, not women.  It is only recently that women have started to perform this dance form.  The historical context of the dance form is rooted in its association with temple traditions and the participation of young boys in religious performances.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gotipua dance is characterized by its lively and expressive movements, often showcasing stories from Hindu epics and mythology. The dancers' costumes are known for their vibrant colors and intricate designs, adding to the overall visual spectacle of the performance.  The dance combines grace and energy, showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Odisha.

1. The Ashoka Chakra is awarded posthumously only and is the highest peacetime gallantry award.
2. The Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra are awarded for acts of bravery in the face of the enemy, during wartime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ashoka Chakra is the highest military decoration awarded for valour, courage, and self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy during wartime.  While it can be awarded posthumously, it is not exclusively a posthumous award. The highest peacetime gallantry award is the Ashoka Chakra.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra are peacetime gallantry awards.  They recognize acts of exceptional courage and bravery displayed in non-war situations.  The Ashoka Chakra is the highest military award for wartime bravery.


**9. With reference to the Dhangar community, consider the following statements:**

1.  They are primarily a pastoral community residing in the state of Rajasthan, known for their expertise in sheep and goat rearing.
2.  Their traditional way of life and socio-economic conditions have remained largely unchanged over the centuries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dhangar community is primarily a pastoral community, but they are predominantly found in Maharashtra, not Rajasthan.  Their traditional occupation involves sheep and goat rearing.  Their presence in other states is limited.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dhangar community's traditional way of life and socio-economic conditions have undergone significant changes over time, impacted by factors such as urbanization, industrialization, and government policies.  While they maintain some aspects of their traditional pastoral lifestyle, they have adapted to changing circumstances.


**10. With reference to Madan Lal Dhingra's actions, consider the following statements:**

1. He was involved in the assassination of a British official in India as part of a larger revolutionary conspiracy.
2. His act of violence was widely condemned by the Indian National Congress, leading to a rift within the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Madan Lal Dhingra assassinated Sir Curzon Wyllie, a British official, not in India, but in London.  His act was a part of the revolutionary movement's activities abroad and aimed at disrupting British rule.  It was not connected to a larger conspiracy within India.

Statement 2 is correct. Dhingra's assassination, although carried out with the aim of disrupting British rule, was widely condemned by the Indian National Congress, as it was an act of violence that went against the then prevailing methods of the movement.  The act caused a lot of negative publicity and created a rift, especially between the moderate and extremist factions within the Congress.  It further complicated the movement's political strategies.


**11. With reference to the Classical Languages of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The status of a language as a "classical language" is determined by the government based on its antiquity, historical significance, and continued cultural influence.
2. All languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution are considered classical languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The government of India confers the status of "classical language" on languages that meet specific criteria, including antiquity, a rich and old literary tradition, and continued cultural influence.  The recognition of a language as a classical language is a formal process, not an automatic designation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists the 22 languages recognized as official languages, but this does not automatically equate to them being designated as "classical languages."  The classical language status is conferred separately by the government based on the aforementioned criteria.  Only a few languages from the Eighth Schedule have been granted classical language status.


**12. With reference to the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  It lists 22 languages, including Urdu and Nepali, which are recognized as official languages of the Union.
2.  The inclusion of languages in the Eighth Schedule is subject to a continuous review and amendment process, allowing for addition or removal of languages based on evolving linguistic demographics.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages which are recognized as scheduled languages.  Urdu and Nepali are included in this list.  However the recognition of these languages as official languages of the Union is a separate matter.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Eighth Schedule has been amended several times to add new languages,  it is not a dynamic, continuously reviewed list subject to frequent additions and removals. Amendments require constitutional processes, reflecting a more deliberate and less frequent adjustment to the list of recognized languages.  The addition of new languages is a significant event and not done frequently.


**13. With reference to the term 'jiu-jitsu and aikido', consider the following statements:**

1. They are ancient Japanese martial arts that emphasize self-defense techniques without the use of weapons.
2. They have recently gained popularity as methods for personal fitness and stress reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jiu-jitsu and aikido are indeed ancient Japanese martial arts, originating from different lineages and traditions but sharing some common features, although Jiu-jitsu is not exclusively Japanese in origin.  Both emphasize self-defense techniques using leverage, joint locks, and throws, rather than relying on strikes or weapons.  The emphasis is on controlling the opponent's movements.

Statement 2 is correct. In recent times, jiu-jitsu and aikido have seen increased popularity as methods for personal fitness and stress reduction.  Their focus on physical fitness, coordination, and mental discipline makes them appealing to individuals seeking holistic well-being.  Beyond self-defense, these arts offer benefits in terms of physical conditioning and mindfulness.


**14. Consider the following statements about  Sadbhavana Diwas:**

1. It is observed annually on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi to promote communal harmony and national integration.
2.  The day is marked by various events and initiatives aimed at fostering peace, unity, and understanding among different communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sadbhavana Diwas, or Harmony Day, is observed every year on October 2nd, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.  The day is dedicated to the promotion of communal harmony, national integration, and the spirit of peace and non-violence, reflecting Gandhi's philosophy and ideals.

Statement 2 is correct.  Sadbhavana Diwas is marked by various events across the country, including peace rallies, interfaith dialogues, and initiatives aimed at fostering understanding and cooperation among different communities.  The day is utilized to promote Gandhian principles of peace and harmony.  The aim is to reduce social tensions and promote unity.


**15. With reference to the  Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  It was formed by merging various revolutionary groups and aimed at achieving complete independence through revolutionary means.
2.  Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were the only prominent members of the HSRA involved in the Lahore Conspiracy Case.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The HSRA was formed by merging several revolutionary groups, including the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), with the aim of overthrowing British rule and establishing a socialist republic in India.  The organization utilized revolutionary tactics and advocated for complete independence.  This merger reflected a consolidation of revolutionary efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were prominent members of the HSRA and were involved in the Lahore Conspiracy Case, many other individuals were also members of the organization and participated in various revolutionary activities.  The HSRA was a larger network of revolutionaries.  The Lahore Conspiracy Case involved multiple individuals.


**16. With reference to the  Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act aims to maintain the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.
2.  It prohibits the conversion of any place of worship or its alteration with respect to its religious character.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, aims to preserve the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, the day India gained independence.  This is a key provision of the Act.  It seeks to maintain the status quo and prevent disputes over the religious character of places of worship.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Act aims to maintain the religious character, it does not impose an absolute prohibition on all alterations or conversions.  It provides for certain exceptions and allows for changes in specific circumstances. The Act is not intended to stifle religious practices but to prevent disputes and maintain peace.  It has exceptions based on court decisions.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the  All India Judicial Services (AIJS):**

1.  The AIJS aims to create a unified and integrated judicial service across India, improving efficiency and reducing disparities in judicial standards.
2. The establishment of the AIJS has already been fully implemented across all states and union territories of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The proposed All India Judicial Services (AIJS) aims to establish a unified and integrated judicial service across the country. This would lead to greater uniformity in judicial standards, improve efficiency, and reduce disparities in the quality of justice delivered across different regions.  The concept is to improve the efficacy of the judicial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The establishment of the AIJS is still under consideration and has not yet been fully implemented across all states and union territories.  The implementation of such a major reform involves complex legal and administrative processes and requires cooperation between the central and state governments.  This process is currently underway but not yet complete.


**18. With reference to the  Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners Act, 2023 (hypothetical), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act seeks to enhance the independence and autonomy of the Election Commission of India (ECI) by providing for a fixed term of office and security of tenure for Election Commissioners.
2. The Act introduces a mechanism for the appointment of Election Commissioners through a transparent and merit-based process, ensuring greater accountability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)  *(Note:  This question is based on a hypothetical act.  The actual content of any such act would determine the correctness of the statements.)*

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  *(Hypothetical)*  An act aimed at enhancing the independence of the ECI would likely include provisions for a fixed term and security of tenure for Election Commissioners, protecting them from political interference. This would strengthen the ECI's ability to conduct free and fair elections.

Statement 2 is correct. *(Hypothetical)* An act focused on improving the appointment process would likely introduce a more transparent and merit-based system for selecting Election Commissioners, potentially involving consultations with relevant stakeholders and establishing clear criteria for selection.  This would increase accountability and reduce the possibility of biased appointments.


**19. With reference to the  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants forest rights to only Scheduled Tribes residing in forest areas, excluding other traditional forest dwellers.
2. The Act provides for the recognition of customary rights of forest dwellers, including rights over land, minor forest produce, and access to sacred groves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, grants forest rights not only to Scheduled Tribes but also to other traditional forest dwellers who have been residing in or dependent on forest areas for their livelihood for a substantial period.  The Act's scope includes a broader range of forest-dependent communities.

Statement 2 is correct. A central aspect of the Act is the recognition of the customary rights of forest dwellers, including rights over land, access to minor forest produce (like non-timber forest products), and the protection of their traditional practices related to access to sacred groves and other community resources.  This aims to address historical injustices and ensure the sustainable livelihood of forest-dependent populations.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (hypothetical):**

1. The Act establishes a Data Protection Board to regulate the processing of personal data, overseeing compliance with data protection standards and imposing penalties for violations.
2. The Act grants individuals extensive rights over their personal data, including the right to access, correct, and erase their data, as well as the right to data portability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)  *(Note: This question is based on a hypothetical act. The actual content of any such act would determine the correctness of the statements.)*

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. *(Hypothetical)* A comprehensive data protection act would likely establish an independent regulatory body, such as a Data Protection Board, to ensure compliance with data protection norms and standards.  This body would have the power to investigate complaints, impose penalties, and take other measures to safeguard personal data.  This is a common feature of data protection legislation globally.

Statement 2 is correct. *(Hypothetical)*  Modern data protection laws generally grant individuals significant control over their personal data.  This includes the right to access, correct, or delete their data, as well as the right to data portability, which allows individuals to transfer their data between different service providers.  These rights are crucial for protecting individual autonomy and privacy in the digital age.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question features two statements requiring factual recall and analysis, designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.

**1. With reference to the Gotipua dance form, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gotipua is a traditional dance form of Odisha, primarily performed by young girls who dress as men to enact scenes from the life of Lord Jagannath.
2.  Gotipua is considered a precursor to the Odissi classical dance form, known for its acrobatic figures inspired by the life of Radha and Krishna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gotipua is performed by young boys, not girls, who dress as women, not men, to enact stories of Radha and Krishna, not solely Lord Jagannath.  The dance form's connection to Lord Jagannath is indirect, through its association with the Jagannath temple culture.  Statement 2 is correct. Gotipua is indeed a traditional Odia dance form considered a precursor to Odissi. Its acrobatic elements and themes drawn from the Radha-Krishna mythology are well-documented aspects of the dance.  The evolution from Gotipua to Odissi represents a significant shift in the performance style and incorporation of classical elements, making the connection between the two a key point for UPSC aspirants studying Indian classical dance forms.


**2. With reference to the Kolattam dance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kolattam is primarily a dance performed by men in Southern India, with women often playing supporting roles in the accompanying orchestra.
2.  The Kolattam dance, also known as Kummi in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and Kolannalu in Andhra Pradesh, is characterized by fast movements and storytelling.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kolattam is predominantly a women's dance form, with men typically providing the percussion accompaniment.  Reversing the gender roles in the statement creates a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the dance's performance traditions. Statement 2 is largely correct.  While the description of fast movements and storytelling is accurate, the statement is slightly misleading in its implication that storytelling is a central characteristic of *all* variations of Kolattam. Some regional variations may focus more on rhythmic movements than elaborate narratives.  However, the core information regarding its names in different Southern states and its dynamic nature remains accurate.


**3. With reference to Rabindranath Tagore, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tagore's involvement in the Indian nationalist movement was primarily through active participation in protests and civil disobedience campaigns alongside Mahatma Gandhi.
2.  Tagore composed the national anthems of both India ('Jana Gana Mana') and Bangladesh ('Amar Sonar Bangla'), a unique distinction among national poets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Tagore was a vocal critic of colonialism and advocated for social reform, his contributions to the nationalist movement were primarily intellectual and cultural. He did not actively participate in major protest movements in the same way as Gandhi.  This highlights the nuanced nature of Tagore's political engagement, a point frequently tested in UPSC exams. Statement 2 is correct. Tagore's authorship of both national anthems is a well-known fact, demonstrating his wide-ranging influence across the cultural landscape of the Indian subcontinent.


**4. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The August Offer, preceding the Quit India Movement, was readily accepted by both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, paving the way for a smoother transition to independence.
2.  Gandhi's call to "Do or Die," issued in Mumbai on August 8, 1942, marked the commencement of the Quit India Movement, demanding an orderly British withdrawal from India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The August Offer, an attempt by the British to appease Indian demands, was rejected by both the Congress and the Muslim League. The rejection fueled further discontent and ultimately contributed to the eruption of the Quit India Movement. This demonstrates the complexities of the political landscape leading up to Independence.  Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi's "Do or Die" speech, delivered in Mumbai on August 8, 1942, is a crucial event marking the beginning of the Quit India Movement and the demand for immediate British withdrawal.  The accuracy of the date and location makes this statement a strong test of factual recall.



**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Kakori Train Action:**

1. The Kakori Train Action, led by Chandrashekhar Azad, involved the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) in looting a substantial amount of money from a train near Lucknow in 1925.
2.  The revolutionaries involved in the Kakori Train Action, including Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan, were primarily motivated by a desire to disrupt British economic control over India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the action did involve the HRA and looting a train near Lucknow in 1925, it was led by Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan, not Chandrashekhar Azad. Azad was a prominent revolutionary but not the leader of this specific event.  The substitution of leaders is a common distractor technique in UPSC-style questions. Statement 2 is correct. The primary motivation behind the Kakori Train Action was to target the British government's financial resources and challenge their economic control over India. The revolutionaries saw the looted funds as taxes unjustly collected from Indians.



**6. With reference to Vikram Sarabhai, consider the following statements:**

1. Vikram Sarabhai, born in 1925 in Mumbai, is widely recognized as the father of India's space program.
2. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was formally established in 1962 under the leadership of Vikram Sarabhai.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. Sarabhai was born in 1919 in Ahmedabad, not 1925 in Mumbai. While he is credited with initiating the Indian space program, the exact phrasing "father of India's space program" is an oversimplification and a potential source of confusion.  His contribution was foundational but involved many others. Statement 2 is also incorrect. ISRO was formally established on August 15, 1969, not in 1962. The dates are deliberately shifted to create a challenging question.  The slight inaccuracy in the description of Sarabhai's role and the incorrect date for ISRO's establishment makes this a difficult question requiring precise factual knowledge.


**7. With reference to V.V. Giri, consider the following statements:**

1. V.V. Giri, born in 1898, served as the fifth President of India from 1974 to 1977.
2.  Giri is primarily known for his contributions to the trade union movement and his advocacy for workers' rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. V.V. Giri was born in 1894, not 1898, and he served as the fourth President of India from 1969 to 1974, not from 1974 to 1977.  The alteration of both the birth year and presidential tenure creates a strong distractor. Statement 2 is correct. Giri's significant contributions to the labor movement and his championing of workers' rights are well-established aspects of his biography.  His legacy in this area is a key element for UPSC candidates studying Indian social and political history.


**8. With reference to Khudiram Bose, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bose, born in 1892, was a member of the Jugantar group and was executed for his involvement in the assassination attempt on Lord Curzon in 1908.
2.  Bose's participation in anti-British protests intensified after the Partition of Bengal in 1905.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Khudiram Bose was born in 1889, not 1892, and he was executed for his involvement in an assassination attempt on a British magistrate (Kingsford), not Lord Curzon.  The incorrect birth year and the substitution of the target of the assassination attempt are designed to mislead. Statement 2 is correct.  Bose's revolutionary activities significantly increased after the Partition of Bengal, demonstrating the impact of this event on the nationalist movement.


**9.  With reference to Madame Bhikaji Cama, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cama, a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement, first unfurled the Indian flag at the International Socialist Congress in 1907 in London.
2.  Cama co-founded the Paris Indian Society (Bharat Mandal) in 1905, actively promoting Indian nationalism in Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cama is famous for unfurling an early version of the Indian flag in 1907, it was in Stuttgart, Germany, not London. The change of location serves as a key distractor. Statement 2 is correct. Cama's co-founding of the Paris Indian Society and her role in promoting Indian nationalism in Europe are well-documented facts.  The specific name of the organization and the year of its founding are important details for UPSC preparation.


**10. With reference to  Bharatanatyam, consider the following statements:**

1. Bharatanatyam, originating in Andhra Pradesh, is an Indian classical dance form with a history spanning over 2000 years, documented in texts including Bharata Muni's Natya Shastra.
2. The Tanjore Quartette, under the patronage of Raja Serfoji in the early 19th century, is credited with significantly shaping the repertoire of Bharatanatyam as it is known today.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Bharatanatyam's history extends over 2000 years and is mentioned in texts like the Natya Shastra, its origin is in Tamil Nadu, not Andhra Pradesh.  The incorrect origin state is a significant distractor.  Statement 2 is correct. The Tanjore Quartette's contribution to the development of Bharatanatyam's repertoire is a crucial fact.  The specific details—the Quartette, Raja Serfoji, and the early 19th-century timeframe—add to the question's difficulty level.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's capital, Hampi, is situated on the banks of the Krishna River, a significant tributary of the Godavari River system.
2. The Virupaksha Temple, a prominent structure in Hampi, showcases the distinctive architectural style of the Chalukya dynasty, evident in its intricate carvings and towering gopuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Hampi is indeed a UNESCO World Heritage site and the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, it's located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River, not the Krishna River. The Krishna River flows through Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, but doesn't directly border Hampi. The Tungabhadra, a confluence of the Krishna and the Tunga rivers, is the crucial geographical feature defining Hampi's location.  This showcases the importance of precise geographical knowledge in UPSC preparation; a seemingly minor detail can significantly alter the accuracy of a statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi is a magnificent structure, but its architectural style is primarily associated with the Vijayanagara style, not the Chalukya dynasty. Although the Vijayanagara style drew inspiration from earlier styles, including those of the Chalukyas, it developed its own distinct characteristics. The towering gopuram is indeed a feature of South Indian temple architecture, but attributing it solely to the Chalukya style is an oversimplification.  The question highlights the need for nuanced understanding of Indian architectural history, going beyond broad generalizations to specific stylistic attributes of different dynasties.  The distractor in statement 2 plays on the common knowledge of Chalukya architectural achievements while subtly altering the accurate association to mislead the candidate.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The empire's extensive irrigation systems, including sophisticated tanks and canals, were crucial for its agricultural prosperity and supported a large population.
2. The reign of Krishnadevaraya witnessed a significant decline in the empire's power and influence, marked by territorial losses and internal conflicts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire was renowned for its advanced irrigation techniques, which were essential for its flourishing agricultural economy.  The construction of extensive networks of tanks and canals allowed for efficient water management and supported a large and prosperous population.  This fact highlights the empire's sophisticated infrastructure and its role in economic development.  The statement also points to the importance of understanding the interplay between technology, infrastructure, and societal growth in the context of Indian history.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The reign of Krishnadevaraya (1509-1529) is generally considered a golden age of the Vijayanagara Empire. It was a period of significant expansion, military success, and cultural flourishing.  The empire's power and influence reached their zenith during his rule.  The later decline occurred after his death, triggered by various factors, including succession disputes and external pressures. The statement creates a deliberate misconception by associating a period of prosperity with decline, testing the candidate’s knowledge of specific historical periods and rulers.


**3. With reference to the Dhangar community, consider the following statements:**

1. Primarily residing in Maharashtra, the Dhangars are predominantly an agrarian community known for their expertise in rice cultivation.
2. The Dhangar community is currently categorized under the Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJNT) category in Maharashtra and enjoys significant land ownership rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Dhangars are a significant community in Maharashtra, they are primarily a pastoral community, traditionally known for their shepherding and livestock rearing, not rice cultivation.  Their rich cultural heritage is intrinsically linked to their nomadic lifestyle and their dependence on grazing lands.  This fact highlights the importance of understanding the diverse livelihoods and traditional practices of different communities in India.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Dhangars are listed under the VJNT category in Maharashtra,  this categorization doesn't automatically equate to significant land ownership rights.  Their nomadic lifestyle and historical marginalization have often resulted in limited access to land resources.  The demand for "grazing corridors" reflects their ongoing struggle for secure access to pasturelands. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of social and economic issues related to marginalized communities and the complexities of government categorization systems. The distractor in Statement 2 uses plausible information about the VJNT classification to misdirect the candidate from understanding the nuances of land ownership.


**4. With reference to the  Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  All languages included in the Eighth Schedule are considered classical languages of India.
2.  The inclusion of new languages in the Eighth Schedule requires fulfilling specific pre-defined criteria set by the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Eighth Schedule lists 22 languages recognized by the Indian Constitution. However, only six of these languages (Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia) have been officially declared as classical languages. The declaration of classical language status is a separate process with its own criteria.  This demonstrates the need to differentiate between constitutional recognition and the separate classification of classical languages.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While there have been attempts to establish criteria for including languages in the Eighth Schedule, no fixed or formally codified criteria exist. The inclusion of languages has been a political process influenced by various factors, including linguistic, cultural, and political considerations.  The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the constitutional framework related to languages and the political dynamics influencing language policy in India. The distractor in statement 2 creates a misconception that a rigid constitutional process governs the inclusion of languages in the Eighth Schedule.


**5.  With reference to  Madan Lal Dhingra, consider the following statements:**

1. Dhingra was a member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), known for its advocacy of armed struggle against British rule.
2. Dhingra's assassination of Curzon Wyllie took place in India, leading to his immediate execution by the British authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madan Lal Dhingra was involved in revolutionary activities and associated with Indian independence movements, he was not a member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).  His connections were with other revolutionary groups and individuals like Shyamji Krishnavarma and Veer Savarkar.  This highlights the need for precise knowledge of individuals and their affiliations within the Indian independence movement.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Madan Lal Dhingra assassinated Curzon Wyllie in London, not in India.  His actions in Britain, a direct act of revolutionary violence on British soil, led to his trial and subsequent execution. The fact that the assassination occurred in London is a crucial detail often overlooked, testing the candidate’s ability to recall precise facts.  The distractor in statement 2 plays on the common knowledge of British response to revolutionary activities, while misrepresenting the location of the assassination.


**6. With reference to  Rajiv Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1. Sadbhavana Diwas, observed annually on August 20th, commemorates the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi and focuses on promoting communal harmony.
2. Rajiv Gandhi was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, while he was still serving as the Prime Minister of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sadbhavana Diwas (Harmony Day) is indeed observed annually on August 20th to mark Rajiv Gandhi's birth anniversary.  The day is dedicated to promoting peace, national integration, and communal harmony.  The commemoration is a significant event in India's political calendar, and understanding its purpose is crucial.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Rajiv Gandhi was awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1991, after his assassination, not while he was still the Prime Minister.  The posthumous nature of the award is a key detail that differentiates this case from other recipients. The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of significant political figures and events, including the details surrounding posthumous awards. The distractor in statement 2 plays on the common knowledge of the Bharat Ratna award, while altering the timing of the award to create confusion.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1. Aluminum is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, exceeding the abundance of oxygen and silicon.
2. India is currently the world's largest producer of aluminum, surpassing China and Australia in production volume.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cooperative banks operate on the principle of mutual benefit for their members, not solely on profit maximization. While profitability is important for sustainability, the primary focus is on serving the needs of their members, often with a social or developmental objective.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of different types of financial institutions and their operational philosophies.


Statement 2 is correct. Cooperative banks do engage in lending, but they are also authorized to accept deposits, although the rules regarding deposits from non-members might vary depending on the specific regulations governing that type of cooperative bank. This tests the candidate’s knowledge of the functions and regulations of cooperative banks.  The distractor in statement 1 uses a common misconception about the primary goal of all financial institutions, while subtly changing the details in statement 2 to create confusion.

2. The Union Finance Minister serves as the Chairperson of the GST Council, while the Prime Minister acts as an advisor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST Council is indeed a constitutional body established under Article 279A. It's a crucial institution for coordinating the implementation of the GST across India, involving both central and state governments.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the institutional framework of the Indian tax system.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Finance Minister is the Chairperson of the GST Council, not the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister doesn't formally hold any position within the council but may be consulted on significant decisions.  This question tests knowledge about the structure and functioning of the GST Council. The distractor in statement 2 plays on the general importance of the Prime Minister in major governmental decisions, while misrepresenting the chairpersonship of the Council.


**12. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), consider the following statements:**

1. InvITs are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ensure the stability and transparency of the infrastructure investment market.
2.  Income generated from InvITs is fully taxable in the hands of investors, subject to applicable income tax rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. InvITs are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), not the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). SEBI's role is to oversee the market regulations and investor protection within the securities market, including InvITs.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the regulatory bodies in India’s financial markets.


Statement 2 is correct. Income from InvITs is taxable in the hands of investors, although specific tax implications can vary depending on individual circumstances. This tests the candidate’s understanding of taxation in the investment sector.  The distractor in statement 1 uses a plausible but incorrect regulatory body to create confusion.

This tests the candidate’s understanding of India’s coffee industry. The distractor in statement 1 uses plausible but incorrect information about India’s global ranking to mislead the candidate.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Repo Rate:**

1.  The Repo Rate is the rate at which commercial banks lend money to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  An increase in the Repo Rate by the RBI is typically implemented to curb inflation by reducing the money supply.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Repo Rate is the rate at which commercial banks *borrow* money from the RBI, not lend.  This is a fundamental concept in monetary policy.


Statement 2 is correct.  Increasing the Repo Rate makes borrowing more expensive for commercial banks, leading to a reduction in lending and ultimately a decrease in the money supply. This, in turn, helps to control inflation.  The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of monetary policy tools.  The distractor in statement 1 uses a subtle but crucial reversal of the direction of funds to create confusion.


**15. With reference to cotton cultivation in India, consider the following statements:**

This completes the set of 15 MCQs.  Remember that these questions are designed to be challenging and test detailed knowledge.  The explanations are intended to be comprehensive, highlighting potential areas of confusion and providing UPSC-relevant context.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in India.  Each question adheres to the specified criteria, aiming for a difficult level and including plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  RRBs are exclusively owned and managed by the Central Government, thereby ensuring uniform policy implementation across all states.
2.  The primary objective of RRBs is to provide credit facilities to large-scale industrial units in rural areas to stimulate economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RRBs are not exclusively owned by the Central Government. They are tripartite institutions jointly owned by the Central Government, the concerned State Government, and a Sponsor Bank (usually a Public Sector Bank). This tripartite structure ensures local participation and understanding of regional needs while maintaining some level of central oversight.  The structure is crucial for effective functioning and local adaptability of RRBs.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary objective of RRBs is to provide credit and financial services to the rural areas, focusing on small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, rural artisans, small-scale industries, and other weaker sections of the rural population.  Their role is vital in promoting financial inclusion and rural development, not in large-scale industrial credit.  The focus on weaker sections is a cornerstone of India's development strategy.



**2. Consider the following statements regarding the regulatory framework for Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in India:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) solely regulates RRBs, with NABARD playing a purely advisory role.
2.  The Narasimham Working Group (1975) was instrumental in recommending the establishment of RRBs, aiming to improve rural credit access.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating RRBs, particularly concerning banking regulations and monetary policy aspects, NABARD also has a crucial supervisory role. NABARD oversees the credit functions of RRBs, ensuring they are aligned with the objectives of agricultural and rural development.  The dual regulatory structure reflects the unique nature of RRBs, balancing the need for banking soundness with the mandate of rural development.


Statement 2 is correct. The Narasimham Working Group (1975) is indeed credited with recommending the establishment of RRBs to address the inadequate credit flow to rural areas.  This recommendation was a crucial step in shaping India's rural financial landscape. The group's findings highlighted the need for a specialized institution to cater to the unique financial requirements of the rural population.


**3. With reference to the ownership structure of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), consider the following statements:**

1. State Governments hold a majority stake in all RRBs, reflecting the decentralized nature of India's banking system.
2.  The Sponsor Bank, which is typically a Public Sector Bank, does not have any ownership share in the RRBs it sponsors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While State Governments are shareholders in RRBs, they do not hold a majority stake. The ownership is tripartite, with the Central Government, the State Government, and the Sponsor Bank each holding a share. The distribution of shares can vary slightly depending on the specific RRB. The distribution of ownership reflects the balance of power and responsibilities in the Indian federal system.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sponsor Bank, typically a Public Sector Bank, plays a crucial role in the establishment and functioning of RRBs, and it does hold a significant ownership share.  The Sponsor Bank provides managerial and operational expertise, contributing significantly to the RRB's success. This involvement is a critical element of the RRB model.


**4. With reference to the functions of NABARD, consider the following statements:**

1. NABARD is primarily responsible for the printing and circulation of currency notes in India.
2. NABARD provides refinance facilities to lending institutions in rural areas to support agricultural and rural development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The responsibility for printing and circulating currency notes in India rests solely with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not NABARD.  NABARD's functions are primarily focused on agricultural and rural development.  The clear division of responsibilities between the RBI and NABARD is essential for maintaining financial stability and promoting targeted rural development.


Statement 2 is correct.  NABARD's core function is providing refinance facilities to lending institutions operating in rural areas. This refinance support enables these institutions to extend credit to farmers, rural entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders involved in agricultural and rural development. This refinance mechanism is vital for ensuring a consistent flow of credit to rural sectors.


**5. With reference to the establishment of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dr. Vyas Committee (2001) recommended the establishment of RRBs to address the credit needs of the rural population.
2. The Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976, provided the legal framework for the establishment of RRBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Dr. Vyas Committee (2001) did examine the functioning of RRBs and recommended certain reforms and consolidations, it did not recommend their *establishment*. The RRBs were already established by the time this committee was formed.  The committee's focus was on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing RRB system.


Statement 2 is correct. The Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976, indeed provided the legal framework for the establishment of RRBs in India. This act laid out the structure, governance, and operational guidelines for these institutions. The Act was a landmark legislation that shaped India's rural financial system.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Karnataka's economy:**

1. Karnataka accounts for over 65% of India's total gold production, primarily sourced from the Kolar and Hutti Gold Fields, and holds a significant percentage of the country's gold ore reserves.
2.  Despite experiencing a positive change in its forest cover and showcasing strong service sector performance, Karnataka faces challenges like extreme water scarcity and a high incidence of desertification, impacting its agricultural output significantly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Statement 1 is largely correct. Karnataka is a major gold-producing state in India, with the Kolar and Hutti Gold Fields being historically significant contributors.  While the precise percentage of India's total gold production attributed to Karnataka might fluctuate slightly year to year and precise figures might vary depending on the source,  it's undeniably a major player in the gold production sector and possesses substantial gold ore reserves. The statement doesn't claim an exact figure, making allowance for minor variations in reported data.

Statement 2 is also largely correct. Karnataka has indeed witnessed an increase in forest cover, reflecting positive environmental changes and contributing to its overall ecological health. The state also boasts a strong service sector, particularly in IT, significantly contributing to its Gross State Value Added (GSVA). However,  Karnataka also grapples with significant challenges.  Water scarcity is a pressing issue in several regions, directly affecting agriculture. The statement's reference to "high incidence of desertification" is a slight exaggeration; while some areas face land degradation, desertification isn't a widespread phenomenon across the state.  Nevertheless, the overall description of challenges affecting agricultural output is accurate.  The slight overstatement in the degree of desertification does not invalidate the core truth of the statement.


**2. With reference to the inter-state disputes in South India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, despite allocating a significant amount of Cauvery river water to Karnataka, has not fully resolved the water-sharing dispute between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, leading to recurring tensions.
2.  The Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal's water allocation to Karnataka has been a major point of contention, involving Karnataka and its neighboring states, and highlighting the complexities of inter-state water resource management in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the ongoing nature of the Cauvery water dispute. The Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal's allocation of water has not prevented recurring conflicts between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.  The dispute involves complex issues of water availability, irrigation needs, and equitable distribution across different states, leading to continuous disagreements and legal challenges.  The statement doesn't oversimplify the situation; it acknowledges the incomplete resolution of the dispute despite the tribunal's decision.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The Mahadayi Water Dispute, involving Karnataka and its neighboring states (Goa and Maharashtra), centers on the allocation of water from the Mahadayi River. The tribunal's decision has been contested, highlighting the challenges of inter-state water resource management. The dispute underscores the complexities of balancing the needs of different states within a shared river basin, often leading to legal battles and political tensions.  The statement accurately portrays the core issue and its implications for regional water management.


**3. With reference to the agricultural sector in South India, consider the following statements:**

1. Kerala, known for its diverse agriculture, is a major producer of spices, rubber, and cashew, while Tamil Nadu is a significant producer of rice, cotton, and groundnut, showcasing the regional specialization in agricultural production.
2. Andhra Pradesh, despite experiencing positive change in its forest cover and contributing significantly to India's industrial value, faces challenges like over-exploited groundwater units and the impact of saline soil degradation on its agricultural output, particularly in coastal areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly highlights the agricultural specialization in South India. Kerala's geography and climate are particularly suited to the cultivation of spices, rubber, and cashew, which form crucial parts of its economy. Tamil Nadu, with its extensive plains and varied agro-climatic zones, is a major producer of rice, cotton, and groundnut, reflecting different agricultural patterns. The statement accurately captures the regional differences in agricultural production based on geographical and climatic factors.

Statement 2 is also substantially correct. Andhra Pradesh, while indeed contributing significantly to India's industrial sector, especially in recent years, faces serious challenges in its agricultural sector.  Over-exploitation of groundwater resources is a major concern in many parts of the state, leading to water stress and impacting agricultural productivity.  The coastal regions, in particular, are vulnerable to saline soil degradation, further affecting crop yields.  The statement accurately reflects the challenges facing Andhra Pradesh’s agricultural sector despite its industrial progress.



**4. Consider the following statements concerning the impact of the 2020-2023 La Niña event on India:**

1. The triple-dip La Niña event, unusual for not following a strong El Niño, resulted in improved air quality in peninsular India and poorer air quality in North India during the winter of 2022-23.
2. This unique La Niña event, possibly influenced by inter-basin interactions between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans and the Pacific Ocean, is attributed to a significant ocean heat deficit in the equatorial Pacific, taking years to recover.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The description of the impact of the triple-dip La Niña on air quality is reversed. The unusual weather patterns associated with this prolonged La Niña event actually led to *poorer* air quality in peninsular India and *improved* air quality in North India during the winter of 2022-23. This is due to complex meteorological interactions affecting wind patterns and pollutant dispersion.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2020-2023 triple-dip La Niña was indeed unusual because it did not follow a strong El Niño.  The usual pattern involves a strong El Niño leading to a significant heat loss from the equatorial Pacific, creating a deficit that takes time to recover. The fact that this triple-dip La Niña did not follow this pattern makes it noteworthy.  The explanation offered, involving inter-basin interactions and influences from other Pacific regions, is a plausible and currently accepted explanation for its unusual characteristics. The statement correctly identifies the key features and a potential explanation for this exceptional climatic event.


**5. With reference to the initiatives for promoting electric vehicles in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Heavy Industries' Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India mandates a 50% Domestic Value Addition (DVA) within 3 years of approval, requiring a minimum investment of ₹4150 crore.
2. The Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) 2024, launched to succeed FAME-II, focuses solely on providing demand incentives for electric two-wheelers (e-2Ws) and three-wheelers (e-3Ws), lasting for a period of 6 months.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The scheme does *not* mandate 50% DVA within 3 years; it requires 25% DVA within 3 years and 50% within 5 years.  The minimum investment requirement of ₹4150 crore is accurate, however. The statement misrepresents the timeline for achieving the DVA target, creating a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The EMPS 2024 scheme's duration is 4 months, not 6 months. While the scheme does focus primarily on providing demand incentives for e-2Ws and e-3Ws, it also includes administrative costs and Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities. The statement contains two inaccuracies: the duration and the scope of the scheme.  These inaccuracies effectively make the statement false and highlight the need for precise recall of details.


**6. With reference to the  "Clean & Green Villages" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj's (MoPR) "Clean & Green Villages" initiative, adopted as the fifth theme under the Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP), aims to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG-7 and SDG-13, by leveraging the circular economy in rural ecosystems.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MoPR's "Clean & Green Villages" initiative is indeed the fifth theme under the GPDP.  Its core aim is to create sustainable villages by leveraging the circular economy, thereby contributing to various SDGs, prominently SDG-7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG-13 (climate action).  The statement correctly identifies the key goals and the broader context of the initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the initiative does prioritize solar power expansion in villages and focuses on clean schools and Anganwadis, and promotes organic farming, it does *not* limit solar power installation only to ODF villages. The initiative has a broader scope than the statement suggests.  The statement's restrictive condition on solar power installation makes it false, highlighting the need for careful reading and understanding of the initiative's scope.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding India's food grain management:**

1.  India's food grain procurement mechanism involves a centralized system, primarily handled by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), and a decentralized system, introduced in 1997-98, where state governments procure and distribute food grains independently.  Total food grain production has consistently exceeded 300 million tonnes annually for the past 5 years.
2.  The distribution of food grains in India is a two-tier system, with the central government responsible for procurement and bulk allocation, while state governments handle operational responsibilities, including allocation within the state and the functioning of Fair Price Shops. The recently approved "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan" aims to enhance food security by creating godowns at the PACS level.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. India's food grain procurement operates under both centralized and decentralized systems. The FCI plays a dominant role in the centralized system, while state governments have a significant role in the decentralized system, which was introduced in 1997-98.  While the exact figure of total annual food grain production might vary slightly from year to year,  India has consistently produced  around 310 million tonnes of food grain annually for the last couple of years, easily exceeding 300 million tonnes.  The statement's claim is therefore accurate.

Statement 2 is also correct. The distribution system is indeed a two-tier system, with central and state governments sharing responsibilities. The central government's role in procurement and bulk allocation is accurate, as is the state government's role in distribution and the management of Fair Price Shops.  The "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan" aims to improve food security and reduce wastage by building storage facilities at the PACS level, correctly described in the statement.  The statement accurately reflects the structure and aims of the food grain management system in India.


**8. With reference to the Coastal Aquaculture Authority (Amendment) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act amends the Coastal Aquaculture Authority (CAA) Act, 2005, expanding its scope to regulate all coastal aquaculture activities, including allied activities like seaweed culture, while decriminalizing minor offenses and replacing imprisonment with monetary penalties.
2.  The Act mandates the inclusion of a representative from the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying in the Coastal Aquaculture Authority's composition, enhancing its regulatory functions by requiring all coastal aquaculture facilities to adhere to environmental standards set by the Authority.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2023 amendment to the 2005 CAA Act does broaden its scope to encompass all aspects of coastal aquaculture, including allied activities like seaweed cultivation. The act aims at streamlining regulations and promoting sustainable development.  A key change is the decriminalization of certain offenses, replacing imprisonment with financial penalties. This shift aims to simplify the regulatory process and improve the ease of doing business in the sector.

Statement 2 is also correct. The amendment mandates the inclusion of a representative from the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying within the CAA, strengthening the inter-ministerial coordination in the sector. The expanded regulatory role of the Authority, requiring all coastal aquaculture units to meet set environmental standards, is also accurate. The enhanced regulatory framework aims to promote sustainable and environmentally responsible coastal aquaculture practices.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding India's inland fisheries:**

1. India recently surpassed China to become the world's largest producer of inland capture fisheries, primarily through culture-based fisheries in tanks and ponds, establishing itself as one of the top three fish-producing nations globally.
2. Inland fisheries in India involve both capture fisheries, where fish are harvested directly from natural water bodies using fishing gears, and culture fisheries, which involve raising fish in controlled environments. The growth of inland capture fisheries has significantly contributed to India's overall fish production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. India has indeed overtaken China in inland capture fisheries production, becoming the world's largest contributor to this sector.  While culture-based fisheries are significant, especially in tanks and ponds,  the statement's emphasis on it as the *primary* method is a slight oversimplification.  Inland capture fisheries remain a substantial contributor. India's achievement in this sector has propelled it to a top-three position among global fish-producing countries.  The minor overemphasis on one type of inland fishery does not negate the statement's essential accuracy.

Statement 2 is entirely correct. Inland fisheries in India are characterized by both capture and culture methods.  Capture fisheries involve traditional fishing practices in natural water bodies, while culture fisheries represent a more modern approach involving controlled environments and various aquaculture techniques. The growth in both sectors has been crucial to India's overall fish production and food security.  The statement accurately describes the two main approaches to inland fisheries in India.


**10. With reference to the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), consider the following statements:**

1. RDSS aims to reduce Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% and close the Average Cost of Supply (ACS)-Average Revenue Realised (ARR) gap to zero by 2025-26, excluding private sector DISCOMs from its purview.
2. The scheme prioritizes smart metering in 500 AMRUT cities with AT&C losses exceeding 15%, all Union Territories (UTs), MSMEs, industrial and commercial consumers, and government offices at the block level and above, while offering incentives to states and UTs for fast-tracking prepaid smart meter installations by December 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While RDSS aims to reduce AT&C losses to 12-15% and eliminate the ACS-ARR gap, the target year is 2024-25, not 2025-26. The exclusion of private sector DISCOMs is accurate.  The error in the target year constitutes a significant deviation from the facts.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Although RDSS prioritizes smart metering in the areas mentioned, it doesn't specifically limit it to only those with AT&C losses above 15%. It has a broader approach to improve the efficiency of electricity distribution across various consumer categories and geographical areas. The December 2023 deadline for incentive disbursement is also a point of possible confusion, as it's an incentive target, not a strict deadline for all installations.  The statement contains significant inaccuracies regarding the scope and targets of the scheme's smart metering initiative.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, explicitly defines parliamentary privileges, granting extensive immunities to legislators.
2.  The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, outlines a detailed procedure for initiating contempt of court proceedings against members of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, does not define parliamentary privileges.  Parliamentary privileges are primarily derived from Article 105 of the Indian Constitution and established through parliamentary conventions and precedents. The Code of Civil Procedure deals with civil matters and procedures, not the specifics of legislative immunity.  While the Code grants freedom from arrest for legislators in certain civil cases, it doesn't define the broader scope of parliamentary privilege.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, doesn't address contempt of court proceedings against members of Parliament. Contempt of court is a distinct legal process governed by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and the inherent powers of the courts.  The Code of Civil Procedure focuses on the general rules of civil litigation and doesn't have a specific provision for such a scenario.  The procedural aspects of dealing with contempt by a legislator would fall under the jurisdiction of the relevant court and the Contempt of Courts Act.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the content and scope of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.


**2. With reference to the powers and jurisdiction of Indian courts, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) operates exclusively under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,  for all its legal processes.
2.  District Courts in India derive their powers and procedures primarily from the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,  for handling civil cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a specialized environmental tribunal established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.  While the NGT may consider some principles and procedures found in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, it is not exclusively governed by it. The NGT has its own distinct legal framework and operating procedures, designed to address environmental issues efficiently.  It's a specialized tribunal, not a civil court bound by the Code of Civil Procedure.

Statement 2 is correct. District Courts in India are the primary courts for handling civil cases at the district level. Their jurisdiction, powers, and procedures are largely defined by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. This Code provides the procedural framework for filing suits, conducting trials, and executing judgments in civil matters within the district court's purview.  Therefore, the statement correctly identifies the primary source of legal authority for District Courts in civil cases.


**3. With reference to disaster management in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) are responsible for formulating national-level disaster preparedness plans, while the NDMA provides guidance and support.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs oversees the administrative control of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and monitors its financial resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is the apex body for disaster management in India, responsible for formulating national-level disaster preparedness plans and policies.  State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) are responsible for implementing these plans at the state level, tailoring them to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of their respective regions.  The NDMA provides overall guidance and coordination, but the primary responsibility for formulating national plans lies with the NDMA.

Statement 2 is correct. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs has administrative control over the NDMA.  This includes overseeing the NDMA's functioning, budgetary allocations, and overall coordination with other relevant ministries and agencies. The Ministry plays a crucial role in ensuring effective disaster management at the national level by providing the necessary resources and support to the NDMA.


**4. With reference to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act permits organ harvesting from living donors only if they are close relatives of the recipient and obtain informed consent.
2. The Act strictly prohibits the commercial trade in human organs, criminalizing any such activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, but with a nuanced clarification. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, allows organ harvesting from living donors, but it's not solely limited to close relatives. While close relationships are preferred, the Act also allows for organ donation from unrelated individuals under specific circumstances, provided that all necessary ethical and legal procedures (including informed consent) are followed. The emphasis is on ethical and legal compliance, not just familial relationships.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act explicitly prohibits the commercial trade in human organs, criminalizing any activity involving the buying or selling of organs. This is a crucial aspect of the legislation, aimed at preventing the exploitation of vulnerable individuals and ensuring that organ donation is based on altruistic motives rather than financial gain.


**5. With reference to the Advocates Act, 1961, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates a minimum age of 45 years for applying for the designation of Senior Advocate, with no exceptions.
2. The Advocates Act, 1961, establishes a clear distinction between Senior Advocates and other advocates, outlining their respective roles and privileges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While there's no explicitly stated minimum age in the Advocates Act for becoming a Senior Advocate,  the practice and precedent have established that the designation is generally conferred on advocates with significant experience and standing, which often correlates with age.  However, there is no rigid, inflexible age limit stipulated in the Act. The selection process is based on merit and recognition of professional standing.

Statement 2 is correct. The Advocates Act, 1961, establishes a distinction between Senior Advocates and other advocates.  Section 16 of the Act provides for the designation of Senior Advocates, outlining the criteria and procedure for conferring this title.  Senior Advocates enjoy certain privileges and precedence in court proceedings, differentiating them from other advocates.  This distinction is a formal part of the Act's legal framework.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1. The MCC is a set of legally binding rules enforced under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, regulating the conduct of political parties and candidates during elections.
2. The MCC comes into effect from the announcement of the election schedule and remains in force until the completion of the counting of votes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC is not a statutory enactment, meaning it is not a law passed by Parliament.  It is a set of guidelines and norms issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure free and fair elections.  While the ECI can take action against violations, the MCC itself doesn't have the force of law in the same way that provisions of the Representation of the People Act do.  It's a crucial regulatory instrument, but not a legally binding statute.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCC typically comes into force from the announcement of the election schedule, but it generally ceases to be operative after the conclusion of polling, not the counting of votes. The counting process is a separate administrative procedure, and the MCC's main focus is on maintaining fairness and order during the campaigning and voting phases.


**7. With reference to Plea Bargaining in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Plea bargaining is applicable to all types of criminal offenses, regardless of their severity or nature, as per the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
2. In a plea bargain, the accused essentially waives their right to a full trial and negotiates a reduced sentence or other concessions with the prosecution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Plea bargaining in India is not applicable to all criminal offenses.  The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) places certain restrictions and limitations on its applicability.  Specific types of offenses, such as those involving serious violence or those against women and children, are typically excluded from plea bargaining arrangements.  The availability of plea bargaining depends on the nature and gravity of the crime.

Statement 2 is correct. The essence of plea bargaining lies in the accused agreeing to plead guilty or accepting a lesser charge in exchange for a reduced sentence or other benefits offered by the prosecution. This implies the waiver of the right to a full trial and a negotiation process between the defendant and the prosecution to reach a mutually agreeable resolution.  This accurately describes the core principle of plea bargaining.


**8. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC Chairman and members are appointed by the Prime Minister of India for a term of five years.
2. The UPSC conducts examinations for recruitment to various central government services, including the prestigious Indian Administrative Service (IAS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister,  as per Article 316 of the Constitution. Although the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) recommends the names, the final appointment rests with the President.  The term of office is six years or until the age of sixty-five, whichever is earlier, not five years.

Statement 2 is correct. A primary function of the UPSC is to conduct competitive examinations for recruitment to various central government services, including the IAS, IPS, IFS, and other crucial positions.  This is a constitutionally mandated role, ensuring that selections are based on merit and impartiality.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding Article 67 of the Indian Constitution:**

1. It deals with the removal of the President of India through impeachment.
2. It outlines the procedure for the resignation of the Vice President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 67 deals with the removal of the Vice-President of India. The process mirrors that of presidential impeachment, involving a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament with a special majority. The statement accurately reflects this constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does not have a separate and exclusive article that specifically outlines the procedure for the resignation of the Vice President.  The resignation of the Vice President would be handled according to general constitutional principles and practices, but not through a specific article such as Article 67.  Article 67 deals with the removal process rather than the resignation.


**10. With reference to the Indra Sawhney case, consider the following statements:**

1. The case primarily dealt with the issue of reservations for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India.
2. The Supreme Court's decision in this case significantly impacted the interpretation of the Basic Structure Doctrine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indra Sawhney case (1992) was a landmark judgment that extensively addressed the issue of reservations in India's public sector employment.  The case involved significant legal challenges and arguments relating to the constitutional provisions for reservation and its limits, particularly for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  The case was primarily about the extent and limits of affirmative action for historically disadvantaged groups.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court's decision in the Indra Sawhney case had a significant bearing on the interpretation and application of the Basic Structure Doctrine.  The court's ruling on the issue of reservations was linked to the fundamental principles of the Constitution, shaping the understanding of how far Parliament can go in making amendments that affect fundamental rights without violating the basic structure.  The case’s impact further clarified the boundaries of the Basic Structure Doctrine.

Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', leveraging misleading information and plausible distractors to challenge even well-prepared candidates.


**1. With reference to the Calamity Relief Fund (CRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The Disaster Management Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs solely manages the CRF's disbursement, ensuring funds are used for their intended purpose.
2.  In situations where CRF resources are insufficient, supplementary aid is automatically transferred from the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF), without any further review or approval process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Disaster Management Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs *provides support and monitors* the utilization of CRF funds,  it does not *solely manage* disbursement.  The statement oversimplifies the process, implying exclusive control which is not the case.  The actual mechanism involves a collaborative effort between the Centre and State governments, with oversight from the Ministry.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage clearly states that *additional assistance is considered* from the NCCF when CRF resources are inadequate.  The word "considered" implies a process of evaluation and decision-making, not an automatic transfer.  The process likely involves assessing the severity of the calamity and the needs of the affected state before releasing NCCF funds.  The automatic nature described in the statement is a misrepresentation of the procedure.


**2. With reference to Aldermen in the Delhi Municipal Corporation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aldermen nominated by the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) under Section 3 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957,  serve a fixed term of five years, irrespective of any changes in the Corporation's composition.
2.  Despite lacking voting rights in MCD meetings, aldermen hold significant influence within their respective Wards Committees by chairing all meetings and possessing veto power over decisions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text doesn't specify a fixed five-year term for aldermen. The tenure might be linked to the MCD's term or other factors not mentioned in the given information.  Introducing a fixed term creates a false sense of certainty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that aldermen play a "crucial role" and serve on Wards Committees, but it doesn't mention them chairing meetings or having veto power.  Attributing such substantial authority to them is a significant exaggeration of their actual influence.  Their role is advisory and supportive, not dictatorial within the committees.


**3. With reference to the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act explicitly permits organ harvesting from living donors only if they are immediate family members, prioritizing blood relatives over other consenting individuals.
2.  The Act establishes a comprehensive national registry for all organ donations and transplants, ensuring complete transparency and traceability of every organ.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act allows harvesting from living donors, but it doesn't restrict it *only* to immediate family members.  Consenting individuals outside the immediate family can also be donors, provided they meet the stipulated criteria and the donation adheres to ethical guidelines. The statement wrongly implies a restrictive family-only clause.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act aims to prevent commercial dealings and regulate organ transplantation, the existence of a *comprehensive national registry* for *all* donations and transplants is not explicitly stated.  The text mentions a national registry *within the National Organ Transplant Programme*, but this is a separate initiative, and the statement incorrectly attributes this to the 1994 Act itself.  The scope and completeness of any national registry are not fully detailed in the provided excerpt.


**4. With reference to India's refugee policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's adherence to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol ensures a robust legal framework for protecting refugees.
2.  India's Foreigners Act, 1946, provides a specific legal framework for handling asylum seekers and refugees separate from its provisions for illegal immigrants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that India is *not* a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol.  Therefore, the claim of a robust legal framework based on these agreements is false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clarifies that all foreign undocumented nationals, including asylum seekers and refugees, are governed under existing laws like the Foreigners Act, 1946, and other acts.  It does *not* state that there is a separate legal framework specifically for asylum seekers and refugees; the existing laws are applied broadly.  The statement falsely suggests distinct legal treatment.


**5. With reference to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), consider the following statements:**

1. A JPC's recommendations are legally binding on the government, ensuring that the committee's findings are implemented.
2.  A JPC is constituted only when both Houses of Parliament unanimously agree on its formation and the specific terms of reference.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that a JPC's recommendations are *not* legally binding on the government.  They hold persuasive value, but the government retains the discretion to accept or reject them.  The statement misrepresents the JPC's authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explains that a JPC is set up after a motion is passed by one House and *agreed upon* by the other.  Unanimous agreement is not required; a simple majority or agreement is sufficient to establish the committee.  The statement wrongly imposes a condition of unanimous consent.


**6. With reference to the  Supreme Court of India's power, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India can only exercise its power of judicial review in cases concerning fundamental rights, not in matters related to ordinary legislation.
2. The Supreme Court of India possesses the power to declare any law enacted by the Parliament as unconstitutional solely based on the opinion of the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's power of judicial review extends to *all* laws, including ordinary legislation, not just those concerning fundamental rights.  The statement severely limits the scope of judicial review.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court can declare laws unconstitutional, this decision is not based *solely* on the Chief Justice's opinion. It involves a collegial process, with judges deliberating and reaching a consensus through a judicial process. The statement wrongly attributes the power to a single individual.


**7. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is a statutory law enacted by Parliament, ensuring its legal enforceability.
2.  The MCC remains in effect only during the period between the announcement of the election schedule and the declaration of election results.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the MCC is *not* statutory; it's a set of guidelines established by the Election Commission of India in consultation with political parties.  It is not a law passed by the Parliament.  The statement mischaracterizes the MCC's legal status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the MCC is operational during the period mentioned, the statement is too restrictive.  The MCC's applicability might extend to other periods or contexts related to elections and political activity, depending on the specific circumstances. The statement incorrectly bounds the time period to only the given period.


**8. With reference to the Plea Bargaining provision under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), consider the following statements:**

1. Plea bargaining applies to all criminal offences, regardless of the severity of the punishment.
2.  The accused, under plea bargaining, can only plead guilty if they are represented by a senior advocate.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage specifies that plea bargaining applies only to offences punishable by up to seven years of imprisonment, with certain exclusions (crimes against women, children, or socio-economic offences).  The statement incorrectly claims universal applicability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage does not mention any requirement for representation by a senior advocate for plea bargaining.  The statement introduces a non-existent condition for exercising the right to plea bargain.  The accused can be represented by any advocate or even choose self-representation.


**9. With reference to the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), consider the following statements:**

1. NAFCC funds are allocated exclusively to projects focused on mitigating the impacts of climate change through technological interventions, excluding community-based adaptation strategies.
2. The distribution of NAFCC funds is managed directly by the Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change, without any involvement of other ministries or agencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While NAFCC addresses climate change impacts, it does not exclude community-based strategies. A holistic approach is likely employed, encompassing both technological and community-led adaptation measures.  The statement falsely suggests a limited focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text indicates that NAFCC projects are institutionalised by "respective ministries" and coordinated by the Prime Minister’s Council on Climate Change.  This implies a collaborative and distributed management structure, not exclusive control by the Council. The statement incorrectly represents the governance structure as centralized.


**10. With reference to the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCAP aims to achieve a 20% reduction in PM10 levels across all cities in India by 2025-26.
2. The NCAP's coverage includes all major metropolitan cities in India, irrespective of their current air quality status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCAP targets a 40% reduction in PM10 levels or the achievement of national standards (60 microgram/cubic meter) by 2025-26, but this is only in 131 cities. The statement incorrectly states a 20% reduction for *all* cities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCAP covers 131 cities across 24 states, which is not all major metropolitan cities. Many other cities are not included. The statement wrongly implies universal coverage.  The selection of cities is likely based on factors like current air quality levels and the potential for impact.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri range, are a significant water divide in Peninsular India, influencing the flow of numerous rivers.
2.  The Western Ghats' steep gradient and high rainfall contribute to rapid river flow, leading to the formation of numerous waterfalls and gorges, particularly in Karnataka and Kerala.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are factually accurate reflections of the Western Ghats' geographical characteristics.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Western Ghats (Sahyadris) as a crucial water divide in Peninsular India, separating river systems that drain into the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. This fundamental role in shaping the hydrological patterns of the region is a key element of its geographical significance.  Statement 2 accurately describes the impact of the Western Ghats' steep slopes and high rainfall.  The combination of these factors results in a high velocity of river flow, contributing to the formation of numerous waterfalls and gorges, a feature prominently observed in the states of Karnataka and Kerala, which experience the most intense precipitation due to the mountain range's orographic effect. The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the combined accuracy of both statements in describing the Western Ghats' influence on river systems and landforms.


**2. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats mountain range, formed during the Late Cenozoic era, contains significant reserves of Magnetite, a crucial iron ore.
2. The Western Ghats' ecologically sensitive areas, as designated by the Central Government, exceed 60,000 square kilometers and include locations like Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats, formed during the Late Cenozoic era, are indeed rich in mineral resources, including significant deposits of Magnetite, a primary source of iron ore. This geological characteristic is crucial to understanding the region's economic potential and history. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Central Government has declared a significant portion of the Western Ghats as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA), the precise area designated is closer to 56,825.7 sq km (as stated in the provided text), not exceeding 60,000 sq km.  Furthermore, while Mumbai is located on the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, near the Western Ghats' influence, it is not technically *within* the mountain range itself. Similarly, Thiruvananthapuram is located on the southwestern coast of India within the region affected by the Western Ghats, but not technically within the mountain range.  The inclusion of these cities as being within the designated ESA is therefore inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The rain-shadow effect caused by the Western Ghats results in significantly less rainfall on the Tamil Nadu coast, compared to the windward side.
2. Telangana, though geographically distant from the Western Ghats, experiences a noticeable rain-shadow effect, leading to relatively arid conditions in certain areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats act as a significant barrier to the southwest monsoon winds.  The orographic rainfall on the windward side (the western slopes) results in a rain-shadow effect on the leeward side (the eastern slopes), leading to significantly reduced rainfall along the Tamil Nadu coast. This phenomenon is a key aspect of the regional climate variations. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the rain-shadow effect is a geographical phenomenon that can extend beyond the immediate vicinity of a mountain range, Telangana's distance from the Western Ghats and its location within a different hydrological regime render the rain-shadow effect of the Western Ghats minimal in its impact on Telangana's climate.  Telangana's climate is primarily influenced by other factors, including the Bay of Bengal branch of the monsoon and its position within the Deccan plateau.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the impact of the Western Ghats.


**4. With reference to the ecological significance of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats support a unique biome of Sub-tropical Moist Pine Forests, contributing to its high biodiversity.
2. The Western Ghats, along with Sri Lanka, form one of the world’s 34 biodiversity hotspots, characterized by high levels of endemism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Western Ghats are indeed a biodiversity hotspot with diverse forest types, the description of "Sub-tropical Moist Pine Forests" as a *unique* biome supported by the Western Ghats is inaccurate. Though some pine forests exist in the higher elevations, they are not the defining feature of the region's biodiversity, which is far richer and more diverse. Statement 2 is correct. The Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, sharing similar biogeographical characteristics and high levels of endemism (species found nowhere else), are indeed recognized as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. This shared biodiversity is a crucial factor in conservation efforts. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the specific characteristics of the Western Ghats' biodiversity and its classification within global biodiversity hotspots.


**5. With reference to the Western Ghats and its governance, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), also known as the Gadgil Committee, made recommendations for the preservation of the Western Ghats, influencing subsequent government policies.
2. The Kasturirangan Committee, appointed after the WGEEP, proposed the declaration of Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) in the Western Ghats, differing in extent from the WGEEP's proposals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the history of governance and policy concerning the Western Ghats. Statement 1 correctly points out the significant role of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), often referred to as the Gadgil Committee, in shaping the understanding and policy surrounding the conservation of the Western Ghats. The Committee's recommendations significantly influenced subsequent policy decisions.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Kasturirangan Committee was indeed appointed following the WGEEP and proposed the declaration of Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) within the Western Ghats.  Crucially, the Kasturirangan Committee's proposals for the extent of the ESAs differed from those initially recommended by the Gadgil Committee (WGEEP), reflecting the complexities and ongoing debates surrounding appropriate conservation measures.  The other options are incorrect as they do not acknowledge the contributions and distinctions between the two committees' work.


**6.  With reference to the geographical extent of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Western Ghats extend across six states of India, with approximately 60% of the mountain range lying within the state of Karnataka.
2.  The Western Ghats converge with the Eastern Ghats in the southern part of the Indian Peninsula, forming a continuous mountain range.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats do indeed stretch across six Indian states: Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.  A significant portion, approximately 60%, is located in Karnataka, reflecting its extensive presence in that state. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats are distinct mountain ranges. Though they run roughly parallel, they do not converge to form a continuous chain.  There is a significant gap between the two ranges. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the relationship and geographical extent of the Western and Eastern Ghats.



**7. Consider the following statements:**

1. The  Western Ghats are characterized by high rainfall, leading to the formation of numerous rivers and contributing to the rich biodiversity of the region.
2. Sugarcane cultivation is unsuitable in the rain-shadow regions of the Western Ghats due to the low rainfall and specific soil conditions.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats receive high rainfall, primarily due to the orographic effect of the southwest monsoon winds. This abundant rainfall supports a dense network of rivers and streams, fostering a high level of biodiversity.  This high rainfall and the resulting fertile soil are crucial for the region's unique ecosystem. Statement 2 is also correct. Sugarcane cultivation requires abundant water and specific soil conditions.  The rain-shadow regions of the Western Ghats, characterized by lower rainfall and different soil types (often drier and less fertile), are not suitable for the large-scale cultivation of sugarcane.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements concerning the Western Ghats' climatic conditions and their impact on agricultural suitability.

2.  The high rainfall in the Western Ghats supports the growth of Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests, a characteristic biome of the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Western Ghats are known for high rainfall, especially on the windward side, the assertion that it experiences *predominantly high rainfall throughout the year* is an oversimplification.  Rainfall patterns vary significantly within the Western Ghats depending on factors such as altitude, proximity to the coast, and the monsoons' influence.  There are distinct wet and dry seasons. Statement 2 is correct.  The high annual rainfall in the Western Ghats, particularly on the windward side, creates conditions that support the growth of Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests, which are a distinctive and significant feature of the region's biodiversity.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect in its initial coverage of cities.  The number of cities and towns initially covered was significantly less than 500.  It also gives an inaccurate completion year for the objectives. Statement 2 correctly states the launch year of AMRUT and AMRUT 2.0, and accurately describes the scheme's goal of providing every household with assured water supply and sewerage connections. The initial coverage was less than 500 cities and towns initially. The question assesses understanding of government schemes related to urban development. The errors in statement 1 regarding the number of cities and towns covered initially and the completion year make it a strong distractor.


**15. With reference to the Village Defence Guards (VDGs) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. VDGs are constituted in all states and union territories of India, providing arms and ammunition to members, and are headed by a retired police officer.
2. VDGs are established in vulnerable villages, with members receiving arms and ammunition.  The scheme is not operational in all states and union territories.  They are headed by a retired armed forces officer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the VDG scheme is not operational in all states and union territories.  It also misidentifies the head of the VDGs as a retired police officer; a retired armed forces officer usually heads them. Statement 2 accurately reflects that VDGs are set up in identified vulnerable villages, members receive arms and ammunition, and the scheme's limited geographical reach.  The question evaluates knowledge of internal security schemes. The inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding the geographical reach and the leader's background make it a powerful distractor.


**16. With reference to the 'Ladki Bahin Yojana', consider the following statements:**

1.  The 'Ladki Bahin Yojana' scheme, recently in the news, was announced by the state of Bihar, focusing on girls' education and empowerment.  It provides financial assistance for higher education.
2. The 'Ladki Bahin Yojana', recently publicized, was launched by the Uttar Pradesh government, aiming to improve the child sex ratio and promote girls' education.  It includes provisions for skill development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:**  The correct answer will depend on the actual state that announced the scheme.  Both statements present plausible but potentially incorrect information regarding the state and specific provisions of the scheme.  A thorough check of news sources is required to determine the correct answer.  This question assesses the ability to recall recent news items related to state-level government schemes.  The ambiguity makes it a challenging question.


**17. With reference to Project Pari, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Pari, a recent initiative, is an extensive Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operation by the Indian Army, specifically for the Kerala floods.
2. Project Pari is focused on improving the Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and enhancing girls' education in India.  It involves collaboration with NGOs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)  (Assuming Project Pari is not related to either of the statements, the correct answer is (d))

**Explanation:**

Both statements offer incorrect descriptions of Project Pari.  The correct description of Project Pari would be needed to determine the correct option. This question tests the ability to recall details about specific projects or initiatives. The entirely incorrect nature of both statements makes it a challenging question, demanding accurate recall.


**18. With reference to 'Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana', consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana primarily focuses on promoting inclusive insurance schemes for farmers and rural populations.  It's implemented by the Ministry of Finance.
2. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana is a flagship initiative promoting the development and use of advanced biofuels in India.  It's administered by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 incorrectly identifies the scheme's primary focus as inclusive insurance and the implementing ministry.  The scheme is actually focused on biofuels. Statement 2 correctly identifies the scheme's primary goal as promoting advanced biofuels and the administering ministry. The question tests knowledge of government schemes and their objectives.  The incorrect information in statement 1 regarding the scheme's focus and the implementing ministry is a key distractor.


**19. With reference to the Clean Plant Programme (CPP), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPP is a government initiative aimed at combating air pollution in urban areas through the promotion of electric vehicles and cleaner fuels.  It's implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
2. The CPP focuses on improving the horticulture sector in India by providing disease-free planting material.  It's implemented by the National Horticulture Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 incorrectly links the CPP to air pollution control and electric vehicles. The CPP's focus is on the horticulture sector.  It also misidentifies the implementing ministry. Statement 2 correctly identifies the CPP's objective of improving the horticulture sector through disease-free planting material and the implementing body, the National Horticulture Board.  The question assesses knowledge of agricultural and horticultural schemes.  The entirely incorrect nature of statement 1 regarding the CPP's objectives and its implementing ministry creates a significant distractor.


**20. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NIRF is an initiative of the Ministry of Human Resource Development and ranks only engineering colleges in India.  It uses a single parameter ranking system.
2. The NIRF, implemented by the Ministry of Education, ranks higher educational institutions across various disciplines in India.  It uses a multi-parameter ranking system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because NIRF ranks institutions across multiple disciplines and not only engineering colleges.  It also incorrectly states that it uses a single parameter ranking system; it uses a multi-parameter system. Statement 2 correctly identifies the implementing ministry, the broad scope of NIRF's rankings, and its use of a multi-parameter system. The question tests knowledge of educational policies and ranking frameworks.  The inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding the scope of ranking and the ranking methodology act as strong distractors.

**1. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NIRF ranking methodology uses a weighted average across teaching, learning, and resources, research and professional practice, graduation outcomes, outreach and inclusivity, and perception.  The weightage assigned to each category is not uniform.
2. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) directly participates in the NIRF ranking process by independently evaluating research outputs of participating institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NIRF employs a multi-criteria ranking system, assessing institutions across several broad categories. However, these categories are not given equal weightage; the relative importance of each parameter varies depending on the specific category being ranked (overall, universities, colleges, etc.).  The weights are carefully designed to reflect the importance of each aspect in the overall quality of the institution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ANRF is a significant organization promoting research in India, it does not directly participate in the NIRF ranking process by independently evaluating institutions.  The NIRF ranking relies on a combination of data submitted by the institutions themselves and external data sources, but ANRF is not a primary source for NIRF evaluations. The evaluation process involves various metrics and data points, collected and verified through different channels, ensuring transparency and objectivity.


**2. With reference to the Ministry of Education's role in higher education, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Education directly manages the day-to-day operations of all higher educational institutions in India, including curriculum development and faculty appointments.
2. The Ministry of Education's oversight extends to the Samagra Siksha Abhiyaan, a program primarily focused on school education, but also incorporates elements relevant to higher education's future workforce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of Education does not directly manage the day-to-day operations of all higher educational institutions.  While it sets overarching policies and regulations, the individual institutions possess significant autonomy in their internal management, including curriculum and faculty matters.  The regulatory framework allows for decentralized governance to suit diverse institutional contexts.

Statement 2 is correct. The Samagra Siksha Abhiyaan, while primarily focused on school education, has implications for higher education.  By improving the quality of school education, the scheme contributes to a better-prepared pool of students entering higher education, impacting the workforce and future needs of higher educational institutions.  The Ministry's responsibility for Samagra Siksha thus indirectly connects to higher education's long-term objectives.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana primarily focuses on promoting the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) across India to reduce carbon emissions.
2. The scheme's implementation is overseen by a technical body under the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, responsible for infrastructure development related to biofuel adoption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana (JI-VAN stands for  "Jivamukti Vanaspati" or  "Biofuels")  does not focus on electric vehicles. Its core objective is to promote the use of biofuels, particularly 2G ethanol, as an alternative to fossil fuels, thereby reducing reliance on imported petroleum and mitigating environmental concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme is implemented through a technical body under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, not the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.  The Ministry of Environment's role is crucial in managing environmental impacts and promoting sustainable energy solutions, which aligns directly with the biofuel promotion goals of JI-VAN.


**4. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on the training and development of newly recruited civil servants, providing them with foundational skills and knowledge.
2. The program heavily emphasizes traditional classroom training methods, minimizing the use of technology-based learning platforms.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mission Karmayogi does include training for newly recruited civil servants, its scope is broader. It aims at the capacity building and holistic development of all levels of civil servants, not just recruits. The program focuses on creating a future-ready civil service through continuous learning and skill enhancement throughout a civil servant's career.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi utilizes a blended learning approach, integrating both online and offline training methods.  It leverages technology extensively through platforms like iGOT Karmayogi, providing flexible and accessible learning opportunities. The emphasis is on competency-driven training, utilizing diverse methodologies to maximize learning effectiveness.


**5. With reference to the Jiyo Parsi Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jiyo Parsi Scheme, launched in 2013-14, is a State-level initiative aimed at addressing the declining population of the Parsi community in a particular state.
2. The scheme's components include financial incentives for Parsi couples to have children and community-based health initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme is a Central Sector Scheme, not a state-level initiative.  It is implemented nationwide to address the declining population of the Parsi community across India, not limited to a specific state.

Statement 2 is incorrect, while the scheme aims to improve the health and well-being of the Parsi community, it does not offer direct financial incentives for couples to have children. The scheme focuses on providing medical assistance and support to the community to improve their overall health and well-being, promoting initiatives that indirectly encourage population growth.  The focus is on addressing the reasons behind the declining birth rate within the community rather than offering direct financial incentives.


**6. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are schemes where the funding is entirely borne by the Union Government, with State Governments solely responsible for implementation and monitoring.
2.  The Sarkaria Commission Report of 1987 provided a comprehensive definition and framework for CSSs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs involve cost-sharing between the Union and State Governments.  While the Centre provides a significant portion of the funding, State Governments also contribute financially. This cost-sharing arrangement reflects the collaborative federal structure of India's governance.  The implementation and monitoring of CSSs involve both levels of government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Baijal Committee Report of 1987, not the Sarkaria Commission Report, is associated with the definition and framework for CSSs. The Baijal Committee's recommendations significantly influenced the design and implementation of CSSs in India.  The Sarkaria Commission focused primarily on Centre-State relations and the distribution of powers, although it indirectly touches upon the financial aspects of intergovernmental cooperation.


**7. With reference to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMCG was established as a statutory body under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
2. The NMCG's management structure comprises a Governing Council headed by the Prime Minister and an Executive Committee chaired by the Minister of Jal Shakti.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMCG was registered as a society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, not established as a statutory body under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  While it operates within the framework of environmental laws, its legal status is that of a registered society, allowing for more flexibility in its operational structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMCG has a two-tier management structure.  A Governing Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, provides overall policy direction.  An Executive Committee, chaired by the Minister of Jal Shakti, is responsible for implementing the decisions of the Governing Council and managing the day-to-day operations of the NMCG.  This structure ensures both high-level policy oversight and effective operational management.


**8. With reference to the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), consider the following statements:**

1. ONDC's primary goal is to enhance the digital literacy and access to technology among small businesses and retailers in rural areas of India.
2. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Ministry of Communications, is the primary implementing agency for ONDC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ONDC aims to benefit small businesses and retailers, its primary goal is not to enhance digital literacy. Its core objective is to democratize e-commerce by creating a more open and interoperable digital marketplace, promoting competition and providing equal opportunities to all participants, irrespective of their size or technological capabilities.  Digital literacy initiatives may be complementary, but they are not the central focus of ONDC.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ONDC was launched by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, not the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).  DPIIT's role is relevant because it focuses on promoting industry and trade, aligning with ONDC's objective of creating a more inclusive and competitive e-commerce ecosystem.


**9. With reference to the UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. UDAN's primary objective is to develop new airports and expand air traffic control infrastructure across India.
2. The first UDAN flight connected a major metropolitan city to a remote island territory in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While UDAN contributes to improved infrastructure, its primary focus is not on developing new airports or expanding air traffic control infrastructure. The scheme aims to boost regional air connectivity by incentivizing airlines to provide affordable air travel to underserved areas.  Airport development and air traffic control remain under the purview of other government agencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The first UDAN flight connected Shimla to Delhi, not a remote island territory.  While UDAN aims to improve connectivity to remote areas, its initial focus was on connecting smaller cities and towns within mainland India to major hubs.  The expansion of UDAN has since included more remote and less accessible regions.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the SLCR Project:**

1. The SLCR Project focuses solely on the construction of new dams and reservoirs along the Varuna River to enhance water storage capacity.
2. The SLCR Project's Decision Support System (DSS) utilizes satellite imagery and hydrological modeling to predict flood events in the Varuna River basin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SLCR (Smart Laboratory on Clean Rivers) Project is not solely focused on dam construction.  It is a comprehensive river rejuvenation project involving various interventions, including water quality improvement, wastewater management, and community participation. Dam construction is not a core component of the SLCR approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The SLCR Project's DSS integrates various data sources, including satellite imagery and hydrological models, to analyze water dynamics and predict potential flood events.  This data-driven approach aids in better water resource management and disaster preparedness within the Varuna River basin.  The DSS helps in making informed decisions regarding water allocation, infrastructure development, and mitigation strategies.


**11. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMJDY accounts are required to maintain a minimum average monthly balance to avoid penalties.
2.  PMJDY solely focuses on providing basic bank accounts to unbanked individuals and does not include any other financial services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PMJDY accounts do not have a mandatory minimum balance requirement.  This was a key feature of the scheme designed to ensure financial inclusion for even the poorest segments of the population.  The absence of minimum balance requirements removes a major barrier to accessing banking services.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PMJDY is not limited to providing basic bank accounts.  It aims to provide access to a wider range of financial services, including credit, insurance, and remittance facilities.  The scheme's broader objective is to integrate the unbanked population into the formal financial system, providing them with access to a comprehensive suite of financial tools and services.


**12. With reference to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides grants for the construction of new agricultural markets and wholesale trading facilities.
2. Loans under AIF are eligible for a credit guarantee from the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) for amounts up to ₹2 Crores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF does not provide grants; it provides loans for post-harvest management infrastructure development.  The focus is on improving the efficiency and reducing losses in the post-harvest supply chain, not on creating new markets.  Grants are typically provided under separate schemes targeting specific infrastructure needs.

Statement 2 is correct.  Loans availed under the AIF are covered by a credit guarantee provided by the CGTMSE for amounts up to ₹2 Crores.  This credit guarantee reduces the risk for lenders, encouraging them to provide loans to farmers and agricultural enterprises for infrastructure development, even in cases where the borrower's credit history might be limited.


**13.  With reference to the RESET Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The RESET Programme is exclusively designed for retired sportspersons who have won medals in international competitions.
2.  The programme mandates participation in a residential training program at a designated sports facility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RESET Programme is not exclusively for retired sportspersons who have won medals.  It is designed for retired sportspersons, regardless of their medal achievements, to help them transition into a second career.  The program aims to provide them with skills and opportunities to pursue alternative professions after their athletic careers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RESET Programme offers flexible training options, including self-paced learning and on-ground training, without requiring mandatory residential participation at a designated sports facility. The program is designed to cater to the individual needs and preferences of the participants, enabling them to choose the most suitable learning approach.


**14. With reference to Project NAMAN of the Indian Army, consider the following statements:**

1. Project NAMAN is primarily focused on providing medical assistance and rehabilitation services to soldiers injured during active duty.
2. Project NAMAN utilizes a dedicated mobile application for efficient communication and coordination between beneficiaries and service providers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project NAMAN is not primarily focused on medical assistance for injured soldiers.  It is a dedicated initiative designed to provide support and services to Defence pensioners and their families.  Medical assistance might be a part of the overall support provided, but it is not the central focus of the project.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Project NAMAN might use technology for communication, a dedicated mobile application is not its defining feature.  The project focuses on delivering comprehensive services through various channels, including physical assistance and online platforms, to ensure efficient support for defence pensioners and their families. The use of technology is supplementary to the core service delivery mechanism.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, in its modified form, extends the implementation timeline to 2027-28 and includes advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic feedstocks.
2. The Centre for High Technology (CHT), under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, is the implementing agency for the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The modified Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana extends the implementation timeline by five years, until 2028-29, not 2027-28. The inclusion of advanced biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks is accurate. However, the slight inaccuracy in the timeline makes the entire statement incorrect.  The question tests the ability to precisely recall details from the scheme's description.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the CHT, a body under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, is the implementing agency for the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana. This is a straightforward factual recall question.

Option (b) is the correct answer because only statement 2 accurately reflects the information provided. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1 regarding the implementation timeline.  The question effectively differentiates between candidates who can accurately recall specific details and those who might have a general understanding but lack precision.


**2. With reference to the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme provides ₹1,000 to eligible women aged 21-65 years whose family income is less than ₹2 lakh annually.
2. The Bombay High Court ruled the scheme to be non-discriminatory and beneficial to women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The scheme actually transfers ₹1,500, not ₹1,000, and the family income limit is ₹2.5 lakh, not ₹2 lakh.  This highlights the importance of precise recall of numerical data in policy analysis.  A slight deviation can lead to an incorrect answer.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bombay High Court's ruling on the scheme's non-discriminatory nature is explicitly mentioned in the provided text. This tests factual recall of a specific legal judgment related to a government scheme.

Option (b) is correct as only statement 2 is entirely accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracies in statement 1 concerning the financial amount and income limit.  The question demonstrates the need for precise recall and careful attention to detail in interpreting policy information.


**3. With reference to Project PARI, consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI, launched by the Ministry of Textiles, aims to promote contemporary art forms while preserving India's cultural heritage.
2. Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Museum are the implementing agencies for Project PARI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI was launched by the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Textiles. While the objective of blending cultural heritage with contemporary themes is accurate, the incorrect ministry makes the statement false. This tests the candidate's understanding of the correct ministry and its role in cultural initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, not the National Museum, are the implementing agencies for Project PARI. This tests the precise knowledge of the organizations involved in the project's execution.  The inclusion of a plausible distractor (National Museum) increases the question's difficulty.

Option (d) is the correct choice because both statements contain inaccuracies.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they incorrectly attribute either statement 1 or statement 2 or both as correct.  This question highlights the need for precise knowledge of government agencies and their roles in executing projects.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF):**

1. NIRF was launched in 2016 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development to rank Indian higher education institutions across eight parameters.
2.  'Perception' is one of the five broad categories of parameters used by NIRF for ranking higher education institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NIRF was launched in 2015, not 2016, by the Ministry of Education (it was later renamed from MHRD), and uses five, not eight, broad categories of parameters.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the precise year of launch and the number of parameters.  The use of a near-correct but incorrect year and number of parameters creates a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  'Perception' is indeed one of the five broad categories of parameters used by NIRF. This tests direct factual recall.

Option (b) is correct because only statement 2 is entirely accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding the launch year, ministry, and the number of parameters. This question assesses both factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly correct statements.


**5. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U), consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme aims to construct 2 crore houses for economically weaker sections and low-income groups.
2. Families owning a pucca house anywhere in the country are eligible to avail the benefits of the scheme.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The scheme aims to construct 1 crore houses, not 2 crore. While the focus on EWS and LIG is correct, the incorrect number of houses makes the statement false. This tests precise numerical recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The scheme's eligibility explicitly excludes families already owning a pucca house. This tests the understanding of the scheme's eligibility criteria.

Option (d) is correct, as both statements contain factual errors. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they wrongly assert the correctness of either or both statements.  The question effectively assesses the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the PMAY-U scheme.


**6. With reference to the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs involve complete funding by the Centre, ensuring uniform implementation across all states.
2.  CSSs are formulated only on subjects from the Union List to ensure uniformity in policy implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs involve shared funding between the Centre and States, not complete central funding.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the funding mechanism of CSSs.  The statement introduces a misleading concept of uniform implementation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are formulated on subjects from the State List, not the Union List, to encourage state-level prioritization. This tests the candidate's understanding of the constitutional basis of CSSs.  The statement presents a false assumption about policy uniformity.

Option (d) is correct as both statements are inaccurate. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they wrongly assume the accuracy of either or both statements. This question assesses an understanding of the fundamental principles and functioning of CSSs.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Odisha's one-day menstrual leave policy:**

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Namami Gange Mission's scope extended beyond just sewage and industrial effluent treatment, these were indeed key initial focuses. The Mission aimed for a holistic approach to Ganga rejuvenation, but the treatment of pollutants entering the river was a crucial first step.  The mission's multi-pronged strategy encompassed various other aspects, including afforestation, public awareness, and community participation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A crucial aspect of the Namami Gange Mission was its adoption of a river basin approach. This means the Mission's scope explicitly included the tributaries of the Ganga River, recognizing that pollution in tributaries directly impacts the main stem.  Addressing pollution and conservation efforts across the entire Ganga basin was central to the Mission's success.


**3. With reference to the Clean Ganga Fund (CGF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CGF is a lapsable fund, meaning that unspent funds revert to the government's general budget at the end of each fiscal year.
2.  Contributions to the CGF are not eligible for tax deductions under the Income Tax Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Clean Ganga Fund (CGF) is a *non-lapsable* fund. This means that unspent funds from one year do not lapse but are carried forward to subsequent years for continued use in Ganga rejuvenation projects.  The non-lapsable nature of the CGF ensures the long-term financial sustainability of the mission and allows for flexibility in project implementation over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Contributions to the CGF are eligible for 100% tax deduction under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While tourism is a component of 'Arth Ganga', the initiative's scope is far broader than just promoting tourism.  'Arth Ganga' aims to foster sustainable economic development in the Ganga basin by linking the river's ecological well-being with the economic prosperity of the communities that depend on it. The initiative strives to create a sustainable economic model that benefits both the environment and the people.

Statement 2 is incorrect. 'Arth Ganga' aims for a significantly higher contribution to the GDP than 5%. The target is approximately 3% of India's GDP from the Ganga basin. This ambitious goal reflects the economic potential of the region and the initiative's aim to create a robust and sustainable economic ecosystem linked to the river's health.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Ganga Gram Yojana:**

2.  The Yojana's initiatives include only infrastructural development, such as the construction of new roads and bridges.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ganga Gram Yojana aims to develop villages located along the main stem of the Ganga and also its tributaries. The holistic approach considers the interconnectedness of the entire river basin and addresses developmental needs across the entire system.  This comprehensive approach recognizes that the health of the Ganga is directly linked to the well-being of the communities living along its course.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ganga Gram Yojana encompasses a much broader range of initiatives than just infrastructural development.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SBM-G Phase-II aims for a higher standard of sanitation than just ODF (Open Defecation Free).  The goal is for villages to achieve ODF+ (ODF status plus functional and well-maintained community and public toilets) and ideally ODF++ (ODF+ plus sludge and septage management).  The initiative aims to move beyond basic sanitation to comprehensive cleanliness and hygiene.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While financial assistance is provided for the construction of IHHLs (Individual Household Latrines), SBM-G Phase II provides funding for other components as well.  These include the retrofitting of existing toilets, the construction of Community Sanitary Complexes (CSCs), and the creation of assets for solid and liquid waste management.  The scheme's comprehensive approach aims to address all aspects of village sanitation and hygiene.


**7. With reference to the Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY), consider the following statements:**

1. ABRY incentivizes the creation of jobs only in the informal sector to boost employment among low-income groups.
2. The scheme provides financial assistance directly to new employees hired under the scheme.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ABRY focuses on incentivizing job creation in the *formal* sector.  The scheme aims to encourage employers to register new employees with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), thereby bringing them into the formal economy and providing them with social security benefits.  The focus on formal employment is crucial for providing long-term job security and social protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ABRY does not provide financial assistance directly to new employees. Instead, the central government contributes to the EPF (Employees' Provident Fund) accounts of new employees hired by EPFO-registered establishments that meet the scheme's eligibility criteria. This indirect support incentivizes employers to hire more workers, knowing that a portion of their EPF contributions will be covered by the government.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme:**

1. PM-KISAN provides financial assistance to all farmers in India, regardless of their landholding size or income level.
2.  Beneficiaries are identified solely through self-registration on the PM-KISAN portal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-KISAN provides income support to *small and marginal* farmers, with certain exclusions applied based on factors such as income tax payment and professional status.  The scheme specifically targets those most in need of financial assistance, aiming to provide a safety net for vulnerable farming communities.  The scheme's criteria are designed to ensure that the benefits reach the intended recipients effectively.

2.  The premium paid by farmers under PMFBY is a fixed percentage of the sum insured, regardless of the crop or risk profile.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMFBY does *not* cover crop losses due to preventable risks.  The scheme focuses on providing financial protection against non-preventable risks such as natural calamities (drought, floods, etc.).  The exclusion of preventable risks encourages farmers to adopt good agricultural practices and manage their farms effectively, reducing the likelihood of losses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The premium paid by farmers under PMFBY is not a fixed percentage. It is calculated as a percentage of the sum assured or the Actuarial Premium Rate (APR), whichever is lower.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 indeed aims to make all *14* major ports in India carbon neutral by 2047, not 12. This ambitious target reflects the government's commitment to sustainable and green maritime practices.  The plan includes initiatives to adopt green fuels and technologies, making Indian ports environmentally friendly and globally competitive.  The slightly incorrect number in the statement is a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vision 2047 document emphasizes quadrupling port capacity through a 100% PPP (Public-Private Partnership) model, it is not solely focused on this aspect.  It covers a wide range of initiatives across eleven themes, including sustainable and green maritime practices, port modernization, shipbuilding, logistics enhancement, cruise tourism, and maritime education and training.

Statement 2 is correct. The establishment of NABARD by the RBI was indeed aimed at providing credit to the agricultural sector and furthering rural development. NABARD acts as a primary institution for supporting rural credit and development initiatives.


**6.  With reference to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India, under Article 341, exclusively defines Scheduled Castes, leaving no provision for amendment or modification of the list.
2.  The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) is a constitutional body established to ensure the welfare and protection of SC rights and to address grievances, reporting directly to the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 341 defines Scheduled Castes, it doesn't preclude the possibility of amendments. The President of India, on the advice of the government, can modify the list of Scheduled Castes.  The power to add or remove castes from the list rests with the President.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Constitution. It is tasked with ensuring the welfare and protection of SC rights, and it submits its reports to the Parliament.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NFSA provides subsidized food grains to a specified number of eligible households, which are identified based on criteria such as poverty levels and other socioeconomic factors.  It does not guarantee subsidized food grains to every citizen.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NFSA's implementation involves both the Central and State Governments.  While the Central Government sets the policy framework and provides the food grains, the State Governments play a crucial role in identifying beneficiaries and distributing the food grains through their respective Public Distribution Systems (PDS).


**8. With reference to the World Trade Organization (WTO), consider the following statements:**

1. The WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, adopted in 2022, immediately came into effect upon its adoption, aiming to curb harmful fishing subsidies globally.
2. India's participation in the WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies is contingent on the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), advocating for flexibility for developing nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

India's stance on the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies emphasizes the importance of CBDR-RC, arguing that developing nations should have more flexibility in providing subsidies to their fishing industries given their unique circumstances and developmental needs.  India's participation is linked to its concerns about equity and fairness in the application of the agreement.


These questions demand precise factual recall and understanding of nuanced aspects related to the RBI, Scheduled Castes, NFSA, and WTO, making them challenging yet relevant for UPSC aspirants.  The explanations provide comprehensive insights, addressing potential misconceptions and clarifying the rationale behind each correct and incorrect option.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India possesses original jurisdiction in disputes between the Centre and one or more States.
2.  The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction allows it to offer opinions on any question of law or fact referred to it by the President of India, binding on all courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court of India, as per Articles 131 and 131A of the Constitution, holds original jurisdiction in disputes involving the Government of India and one or more States, or between the Government of India and the States.  This is a significant aspect of its role in maintaining federal balance within the Indian Union.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court does have advisory jurisdiction (Article 143), its opinions are not legally binding. The President may seek advice, but the Court's response is purely advisory; lower courts are not obligated to follow it.  This distinguishes the advisory jurisdiction from the Court's judicial pronouncements, which have the force of law.  The non-binding nature of advisory opinions is a crucial distinction in understanding the Supreme Court's powers.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI's monetary policy primarily focuses on controlling the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) to maintain price stability.
2. The RBI regulates commercial banks' activities, including branch expansion and mergers, but not their winding-up procedures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the WPI is an important economic indicator that the RBI monitors, its monetary policy aims for a broader goal of maintaining price stability, not solely focusing on the WPI.  The RBI considers various other factors like Consumer Price Index (CPI), inflation expectations, and economic growth when formulating its monetary policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI plays a crucial role in regulating commercial banks in India.  This includes overseeing their branch expansion, mergers, and, importantly, their winding-up procedures. The RBI has the power to take action against failing banks, including initiating the process of their liquidation or merger with healthier institutions to safeguard the financial system.


**3. With reference to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), consider the following statements:**

1.  ISRO's Gaganyaan mission utilizes the CE20 cryogenic engine, developed entirely in-house, for its propulsion system.
2. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), a key component of ISRO, is primarily responsible for the development of launch vehicles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ISRO is developing the CE20 cryogenic engine,  it is not yet entirely in-house.  The development involves significant technological collaboration and knowledge transfer.  The complete indigenization of cryogenic engine technology remains a work in progress for ISRO.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NRSC (National Remote Sensing Centre) focuses on remote sensing data acquisition, processing, and dissemination.  The development and production of launch vehicles are primarily handled by other ISRO centers, such as the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) and the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC).


**4. With reference to the National Pension System (NPS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NPS is entirely funded by the Central Government, ensuring universal coverage for all Indian citizens.
2.  The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) administers and regulates the NPS, but does not directly manage the assets within the system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NPS is not entirely funded by the Central Government. It is a contributory pension scheme where both the employee and the employer contribute.  While the Central Government plays a significant role in its policy framework, the funding is shared.  Furthermore, the NPS does not have universal coverage; participation is voluntary.

Statement 2 is correct. The PFRDA (Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority) is the regulatory body for the NPS.  It establishes the rules and regulations, but the actual management of the pension funds is delegated to various licensed fund managers.  The PFRDA's role is primarily supervisory and regulatory.


**5.  Consider the following statements concerning the Justice J.S. Verma Committee:**

1. The Justice J.S. Verma Committee's recommendations, implemented in 2013, included a proposal for mandatory death penalty for rape in the "rarest of rare" cases.
2. The Government of India appointed the Justice J.S. Verma Committee in response to widespread public outcry following a specific case of sexual assault.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Justice J.S. Verma Committee, formed in the aftermath of the 2012 Delhi gang rape case, explicitly *opposed* the mandatory death penalty for rape, even in the "rarest of rare" cases.  Its recommendations focused on strengthening legal procedures and improving the criminal justice system's response to sexual violence.

Statement 2 is correct. The committee was indeed constituted by the Government of India in response to widespread public outrage and demands for reform in the legal framework concerning sexual assault, triggered by a high-profile case of brutal sexual violence.  The appointment aimed to address the systemic issues highlighted by the incident.


**6. With reference to the  "PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana," consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme provides a flat subsidy of Rs 78,000 for all residential rooftop solar plants regardless of capacity.
2.  The scheme aims to install rooftop solar systems in one crore households, providing free electricity up to 300 units monthly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The subsidy amount under the "PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana" varies depending on the capacity of the rooftop solar plant.  The scheme offers a tiered subsidy structure, with higher subsidies for larger capacity systems.  A flat rate of Rs 78,000 is not applicable to all installations.

Statement 2 is correct. The core objective of the scheme is to promote the adoption of rooftop solar power in one crore Indian households.  A key incentive is the provision of free electricity up to a certain consumption limit (300 units per month) to encourage participation.


**7. With reference to the Kui language, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kui language, primarily spoken by the Kondh tribe in Odisha, belongs to the Indo-Aryan family of languages.
2.  The inclusion of a language in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution requires fulfilling specific, pre-defined criteria.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kui language belongs to the Dravidian language family, not the Indo-Aryan family.  This is a crucial distinction in understanding its linguistic origins and classification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. There are no formally defined and consistently applied criteria for adding a language to the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.  The process has been largely ad hoc, reflecting political and social considerations alongside linguistic factors.


**8. With respect to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NVBDCP is a 100% centrally funded program aimed at eradicating vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue.
2.  The program focuses solely on preventive measures, with no provisions for the treatment or management of affected individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NVBDCP receives substantial central funding, it is not entirely 100% centrally funded. The program involves collaboration and funding from state governments as well.  Also, eradication is a very ambitious goal; the program aims for effective control and reduction of the burden of vector-borne diseases, not complete eradication.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NVBDCP encompasses both preventive and control measures, including treatment and management strategies for individuals infected with vector-borne diseases.  The program's comprehensive approach is crucial to its effectiveness.


These questions demand accurate factual recall and understanding of the nuances of each topic, aligning with the difficulty level and cognitive skills requirements specified in the prompt.  The distractors are designed to test the examinee's thorough understanding, making simple guessing unlikely.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the K missile family, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agni series of missiles is a part of the K missile family, developed under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP).
2.  The K missile family's development was primarily driven by the need to enhance India's ballistic missile defense capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Agni series is a strategic ballistic missile program, but it is not part of the K missile family. The K missile family primarily comprises short-range and medium-range surface-to-air missiles. The Agni missiles are a separate program focused on long-range ballistic capabilities and fall under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) but not the K family.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the K missile family does contribute to India's overall defense capabilities, its primary design objective is not ballistic missile defense. The K missile family aims to provide a layered air defense system against aerial threats.  Ballistic missile defense is a different and more complex area addressed by other missile programs.  The emphasis on air defense capabilities is central to the K missile family's development.  Confusing the two areas is a common distractor.


**2. Consider the following statements about Dr. Rajendra Prasad's contributions:**

1.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad played a significant role in the establishment of the Bharat Ratna award, serving on the committee that finalized its design and criteria.
2.  He withheld his assent to the PEPSU Appropriation Bill, demonstrating his commitment to fiscal prudence and responsible governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the President of India when the Bharat Ratna was established,  he did not directly participate in its design or criteria. The Bharat Ratna's establishment involved a process that included government consultations and deliberations, not necessarily a dedicated committee with presidential involvement in the specifics of design and criteria.

Statement 2 is correct. As President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad did indeed withhold his assent to the PEPSU Appropriation Bill. This action showcased his commitment to responsible governance and scrutiny of financial legislation, highlighting the President's role in safeguarding the financial health of the nation. This is a less widely known but significant aspect of his presidency, making it a good testing point for factual recall.



**3. With reference to Mohiniyattam, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mohiniyattam, a classical dance form, primarily depicts devotion to Lord Shiva, reflecting the strong influence of Shaivism in Kerala.
2.  The Kerala Kalamandalam significantly contributed to the revival and standardization of Mohiniyattam, including the lifting of gender restrictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mohiniyattam has religious themes, its primary focus is not solely on Lord Shiva.  The dance form is associated with both Lord Vishnu and Lord Krishna, reflecting the Vaishnava traditions prevalent in Kerala. The connection with Shaivism is less direct and prominent than its Vaishnava themes.

Statement 2 is correct. Kerala Kalamandalam played a crucial role in the revival and standardization of Mohiniyattam.  It also played a key role in the formalization of the dance form and removed traditional gender restrictions, making it accessible to female performers. This is a significant detail that highlights the institution's contribution to the preservation of Indian classical dance forms.



**4. With reference to the Kalibangan archaeological site, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kalibangan, located in present-day Rajasthan, is primarily known for its evidence of sophisticated urban planning, including grid-patterned streets and well-developed drainage systems comparable to Mohenjo-daro.
2.  The discovery of a plough field at Kalibangan provides significant evidence of early agricultural practices in the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Kalibangan shows evidence of urban planning, it is not as extensively developed or as well-preserved as Mohenjo-daro.  Kalibangan's urban features are less comprehensive and show a less advanced level of urban planning than Mohenjo-daro. The comparison implies a higher level of sophistication at Kalibangan than is factually supported.

Statement 2 is correct. The discovery of a plough field at Kalibangan is indeed a significant finding. It offers compelling evidence for advanced agricultural practices during the Harappan period, pushing back the timeline of agricultural development in the region. This specific discovery is a key element differentiating Kalibangan from other Indus Valley Civilization sites.



**5. With reference to the Irula tribe, consider the following statements:**

1. The Irula tribe, classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Tamil Nadu, primarily speaks a language belonging to the Dravidian language family.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Irula tribe is indeed classified as a PVTG in Tamil Nadu, and their language is part of the Dravidian language family. This showcases the linguistic diversity within India's tribal communities and their unique cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is correct. The Irula tribe's expertise in snake handling and venom extraction has been a subject of significant interest to researchers. Their traditional knowledge has contributed to scientific advancements in antivenom production and the understanding of snake venom. This highlights the intersection of traditional knowledge and modern science, a vital consideration in UPSC examinations.

1.  The Jitiya festival, primarily celebrated in Bihar, is a harvest festival dedicated to the goddess Yamuna, symbolizing the importance of agriculture in the region's economy.
2.  The festival's mythological roots are primarily linked to the story of King Jimutavahana's self-sacrifice, illustrating themes of devotion and familial well-being.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jitiya is celebrated in Bihar and other regions, it is not solely dedicated to the goddess Yamuna.  The festival is primarily observed by mothers for the well-being of their children. The connection to Yamuna is less direct and prominent than the central theme of maternal devotion and children's well-being.

Statement 2 is correct. The Jitiya festival's mythological underpinnings are strongly associated with the story of King Jimutavahana's self-sacrifice for his mother. This narrative highlights themes of filial piety and devotion, demonstrating a strong cultural value.


**7. With reference to the Poona Pact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Poona Pact, signed in 1932, ultimately resulted in the reservation of seats for the depressed classes in the provincial legislative assemblies, but not in the Central Legislature.
2.  The pact was a crucial step in resolving the conflict between Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar over the issue of separate electorates for the depressed classes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Poona Pact, a significant agreement between Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, did lead to reserved seats for the depressed classes (Scheduled Castes) in provincial legislative assemblies. However, the pact did not extend this reservation to the Central Legislature, a point often missed.

Statement 2 is correct. The Poona Pact was pivotal in resolving the intense disagreement between Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar regarding separate electorates for the depressed classes.  The pact replaced the Communal Award's provision for separate electorates with a system of reserved seats within joint electorates.


**8. With reference to the newspapers *New India* and *Commonweal*, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both newspapers played a significant role in advocating for Home Rule in India during the early 20th century.
2.  *New India* was primarily published by Mahatma Gandhi, while *Commonweal* was associated with Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both *New India* and *Commonweal*, though having different editorial stances and focuses, played a role in the broader political discourse advocating for self-governance and Home Rule during the period leading up to Indian Independence.  This highlights the multifaceted nature of the Indian nationalist press.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  *New India* was published by Annie Besant, not Mahatma Gandhi. While *Commonweal* was indeed associated with Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, suggesting that it was published by him is a common misconception.  The publication history of these newspapers needs to be accurately recalled.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Periyar's Self-Respect Movement did challenge social inequalities, its primary focus was broader than just the Dalit community. It aimed at challenging the entire caste system and empowering the Tamil identity, not just a single social group.  This demonstrates the nuances of social reform movements in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Periyar's resignation from the Indian National Congress actually occurred in 1940, not 1930. This highlights the importance of precise chronological accuracy when addressing historical figures.  A one-decade difference is substantial in historical context.

1. The Tirupati Temple, dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, is an important pilgrimage site for followers of Vaishnavism, known for its unique architectural style.
2.  The Tirupati laddu received its Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2002, protecting its unique recipe and production methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Koodiyattam is an ancient Keralite theatrical tradition that uses full Sanskrit texts, mostly from classical plays and is traditionally performed only by male actors.  This highlights the unique theatrical traditions of Kerala and their connection to classical Sanskrit literature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Koodiyattam is a theatrical form, not a classical dance form.  It originated in Kerala, not Tamil Nadu.  The description confuses the characteristics of Koodiyattam with those of other South Indian dance forms.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Bhikaji Cama was a prominent revolutionary, there's no direct evidence of her significant involvement in the planning or execution of the Ghadar Movement.  Attributing this to her is a common misconception.

Statement 2 is correct. Bhikaji Cama is widely recognized for her role in hoisting the Indian flag at an international conference in Stuttgart, Germany, and for her association with the revolutionary publication *Bande Mataram*.  Her actions were symbolic of Indian nationalism and contributed to raising global awareness about India's struggle for independence.  The question tests knowledge of a specific revolutionary figure's contribution.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jawaharlal Nehru, as the first Prime Minister of India, played a significant role in promoting Hindi. However, his advocacy was nuanced, balancing the need to promote Hindi with concerns about regional linguistic diversity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Official Languages Act of 1963 did not establish Hindi as the *sole* official language.  It recognized Hindi and English as official languages for a transitional period, acknowledging the linguistic diversity of the Indian subcontinent.  This demonstrates the complexities of language policy in India.


**16.  With reference to the  integration of the princely state of Hyderabad, consider the following statements:**

1.  Operation Polo, launched by the Indian government, successfully integrated the princely state of Hyderabad into the Indian Union in 1948.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The  Government of India Act, 1935, introduced a system of bicameral legislatures in all provinces, with reserved seats for women in the upper houses.
2.  The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms of 1919 enfranchised all women above the age of 21, irrespective of property ownership or literacy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India Act, 1935, did introduce provincial legislatures, but not all were bicameral.  Furthermore, while the Act did address women's suffrage, it didn't grant universal franchise to women above 21.  Instead, it allowed for provincial legislatures to decide on the extent of women's enfranchisement, often based on property or educational qualifications.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2 is also incorrect;  the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms didn't grant universal suffrage to women.  The reforms introduced limited franchise for women based on property, tax payment, or educational attainment,  varying by province.  Thus, neither statement accurately reflects the historical reality of women's suffrage in British India.  The question highlights the need for precise recall of the details of these significant constitutional reforms and understanding the nuances of women's political participation during that era.


**2. With reference to the Indian Independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Konyak Naga tribe, known for its participation in the headhunting rituals, actively engaged in armed rebellion against British rule in the early 20th century.
2.  The Kuki community, primarily residing in Manipur and Nagaland, remained largely passive throughout the independence struggle, avoiding direct confrontation with the British administration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the Konyak Naga tribe did indeed practice headhunting,  their involvement in the Indian Independence movement was complex and varied, not solely focused on armed rebellion.  Their participation was more multifaceted, involving both cooperation and resistance at different times and places.  Statement 1 oversimplifies their role.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Kuki community, spread across various regions, did participate in the independence movement, although their participation might have been less prominent compared to some other groups.  This question tests the understanding of the diverse nature of participation in the Indian Independence movement, highlighting the complexities of tribal involvement and the need to avoid generalizations.


**3. With reference to the Garba dance, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Garba, a ritualistic dance performed during Navratri, is primarily associated with the worship of the goddess Durga, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.
2. The term 'Garba' is derived from the Sanskrit word 'Garbha', meaning 'womb', and traditionally involves circling a centrally lit lamp, representing the divine feminine energy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Garba is indeed associated with the worship of the divine feminine energy (Shakti), but it is not solely dedicated to Durga.  Many forms of Shakti are worshipped during Navratri, and the focus can vary regionally. Statement 1 presents an oversimplified and potentially inaccurate religious association.  Statement 2 correctly describes the etymology of the word 'Garba' and the traditional practice of circling a lit lamp, symbolizing the womb and the divine feminine. The central lamp also represents the mother goddess Amba, not exclusively Durga.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.  This question tests the ability to differentiate between primary and secondary aspects of a cultural practice and understand its religious symbolism in a nuanced way.



**4. With reference to the  Athama pageantry, consider the following statements:**

1. The Atham pageantry, a traditional harvest festival, is celebrated in the state of Tamil Nadu during the Malayalam month of Chingam, commemorating the legendary Emperor Mahabali's homecoming.
2.  The Atham pageantry, a significant cultural event in Kerala, marks the beginning of Onam celebrations and is characterized by elaborate processions and traditional performances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 incorrectly locates the Atham pageantry in Tamil Nadu and attributes the wrong mythological significance.  The Atham pageantry is specifically a Keralite tradition associated with the Onam festival.  The association with Emperor Mahabali is correct for Onam itself, but the statement misplaces the pageantry. Statement 2 accurately describes the Atham pageantry as a Keralite event marking the beginning of the Onam celebrations and features elaborate processions and traditional performances. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  This question tests the knowledge of specific regional cultural practices and their association with particular festivals and states.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tirupati Laddu, a renowned sweet, received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2009 due to its unique recipe and production method, which involves the use of specific ingredients sourced locally.
2. The controversy surrounding the Tirupati Laddu involves allegations of the use of substandard ingredients and potentially harmful additives, raising concerns about food safety and hygiene standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tirupati Laddu did receive the GI tag in 2009, recognizing its unique recipe and production method, which are integral to its identity and quality.  Statement 2 is also correct. A controversy did arise concerning the Tirupati Laddu, specifically regarding allegations of substandard ingredients and the potential use of animal fat, leading to concerns about the quality and safety of the product.  Both statements accurately reflect the information about the Tirupati Laddu and its associated controversies. This question tests the knowledge of a specific product, its legal status, and current affairs related to it, emphasizing the importance of understanding both established facts and recent developments.


**6. With reference to the Chota Nagpur Plateau, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agariya community, traditionally involved in mining and metalworking, primarily inhabits the eastern slopes of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, while the Maldhari community is largely confined to the western regions of the plateau.
2.  The Chota Nagpur Plateau is characterized by the presence of diverse tribal communities, including the Munda, Oraon, and Santhal tribes, who have historically practiced shifting cultivation and ancestor worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the geographical distribution of the Agariya and Maldhari communities.  The Agariya community is associated with the Chota Nagpur Plateau, but their precise distribution isn't limited to the eastern slopes.  The Maldhari community is primarily found in Gujarat's Kutch region and not significantly on the Chota Nagpur Plateau.  Statement 2 accurately describes the diverse tribal population of the Chota Nagpur Plateau and their traditional practices.  The question highlights the importance of accurate geographical knowledge and understanding the distribution of specific communities within a given region.  The distractor in statement 1 plays on the potential association of both communities with tribal regions, but their actual locations differ significantly.


**7. With reference to the Rann of Kutch, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rann of Kutch, a vast salt desert, is characterized by a unique ecosystem supporting the Asiatic wild ass and various salt-tolerant plant species, and is home to the Maldhari pastoral community known for their camel rearing.
2.  The Agariya community, traditionally associated with the Rann of Kutch, engages primarily in salt production and fishing, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Rann of Kutch ecosystem, its flora and fauna, and the Maldhari community's presence.  The Asiatic wild ass is indeed endemic to the Rann of Kutch, and the Maldhari community is known for its pastoral lifestyle, which includes camel rearing. Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the Agariya community's primary occupation in the Rann of Kutch. The Agariya are primarily found in the Chota Nagpur Plateau and not the Rann of Kutch.  The question tests the ability to accurately associate specific communities with their geographical locations and understand the characteristics of unique ecosystems.  The distractor in statement 2 uses the similarity of both communities' association with harsh environments to create confusion.


**8. With reference to the  Pichwai paintings, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pichwai paintings, originating in the town of Nathdwara in Rajasthan, primarily depict scenes from the Mahabharata, showcasing intricate details of the epic's characters and narratives.
2.  The term 'Pichwai' derives from the Sanskrit words 'pichh' (back) and 'wai' (textile hanging), indicating their traditional use as backdrops for temple deities, particularly Krishna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pichwai paintings primarily depict scenes from Lord Krishna's life, not the Mahabharata.  While the paintings are highly detailed, attributing them solely to Mahabharata narratives is inaccurate. Statement 2 correctly explains the etymology of the term 'Pichwai' and its association with temple backdrops for Krishna.   The paintings are indeed made on cloth and used as backdrops in temples, particularly those dedicated to Krishna.  Only statement 2 is correct.  The question tests detailed knowledge of a specific art form, its origins, and its religious and cultural context.  The distractor in statement 1 uses the similarity of both epics to mislead.


**9. With reference to the  Dadabhai Naoroji, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji, the "Grand Old Man of India," served as the President of the Indian National Congress on multiple occasions and founded the Indian Association in 1867, advocating for complete self-rule for India.
2.  Naoroji is best known for his formulation of the "Drain of Wealth" theory, which highlighted the economic exploitation of India under British rule, and for his pioneering work in establishing the East India Association in London.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  Dadabhai Naoroji was indeed the President of the Indian National Congress on multiple occasions,  and he was a strong advocate for self-rule, but he founded the East India Association, not the Indian Association. Statement 2 is also correct.  Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth" theory is his most significant contribution, and he played a key role in establishing the East India Association in London, which served as a platform for advocating Indian interests in Britain.  Both statements contain elements of truth, but one has an important factual inaccuracy.  This question tests both factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly correct statements.



**10. With reference to  Pranab Mukherjee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pranab Mukherjee served as the 12th President of India from 2012 to 2017, and his memoir, "The Presidential Years," details his experiences during his tenure, including the challenges of coalition governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Pranab Mukherjee's memoir "The Presidential Years" is accurate, he was the 13th, not the 12th President of India.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While he did receive the Best Parliamentarian Award and the Bharat Ratna, the Padma Bhushan was not awarded in 2008; he received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.  The question tests detailed knowledge of a prominent figure, highlighting the importance of accurate factual recall, especially concerning chronology and awards.  The distractors employ similar awards and slightly incorrect numerical data to create confusion.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swachh Iconic Places initiative included the Tirupati Temple among its target sites for sanitation improvements.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

(a) 1 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Andhra Pradesh is a major agricultural state contributing significantly to India's agricultural output, it doesn't consistently outperform Gujarat in all agricultural yields.  Different states excel in different crops due to variations in climate, soil type, and agricultural practices.  Direct comparison of overall yields requires a detailed analysis that is beyond the scope of a simple statement.

Statement 2 is correct.  Andhra Pradesh possesses a high proportion of its workforce engaged in agricultural labor. This signifies the sector's substantial role in the state's economy and employment landscape, indicating a significant dependence on agriculture for livelihoods.  This is a widely acknowledged fact about the state's demographics.

Statement 2 is correct. Bhagat Singh's arrest was directly linked to his actions of throwing a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly in April 1929, as a protest against certain bills, and the subsequent release of a poster justifying the assassination of John Saunders.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to SEBI's regulatory functions, consider the following statements:**

1. SEBI is the sole regulatory authority for all types of financial derivatives traded in India, including currency futures.
2.  SEBI's jurisdiction extends to regulating the activities of all entities involved in the securities market, including stockbrokers, sub-brokers, and portfolio managers, but excludes mutual funds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While SEBI regulates a significant portion of the financial derivatives market,  the regulation of currency futures falls under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not solely SEBI.  SEBI's focus is primarily on equity and debt securities derivatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEBI's regulatory power encompasses  stockbrokers, sub-brokers, and portfolio managers.  Critically,  SEBI also regulates mutual funds, a significant segment of the Indian securities market.  The statement's assertion that mutual funds are excluded is factually inaccurate.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.  A comprehensive understanding of the division of regulatory responsibilities between SEBI and RBI is crucial for accurate assessment.


**2. With reference to Fiscal Deficit, consider the following statements:**

1.  A reduction in the fiscal deficit is always indicative of improved financial health and reduced government borrowing.
2.  Fiscal deficit is calculated as the difference between total government expenditure and total government receipts, excluding borrowings during a fiscal year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a reduction in the fiscal deficit generally suggests improved fiscal management, it doesn't automatically guarantee improved financial health. A reduction could be achieved through austerity measures that negatively impact essential public services or economic growth.  Furthermore, the level of government borrowing is not solely determined by the fiscal deficit; it's influenced by factors like repayment schedules and existing debt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of fiscal deficit includes borrowings.  Fiscal deficit represents the total borrowing required to finance the gap between government expenditure and revenue. Excluding borrowings would result in a different measure, possibly the revenue deficit.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the concept of fiscal deficit and its implications.  A nuanced understanding of fiscal policy and its indicators is necessary to avoid such misconceptions.


**3. With reference to the Three Gorges Dam and Bhakra Nangal Dam, consider the following statements:**

1. The Three Gorges Dam, located on the Yangtze River, is the world's largest hydroelectric power station in terms of installed capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China holds the distinction of being the world's largest hydroelectric power station based on its installed capacity. This is a widely acknowledged fact in global energy statistics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bhakra Nangal Dam is a significant hydroelectric power plant in India, it is not the oldest.  Several other hydroelectric projects were operational in India before its independence.  The statement incorrectly attributes the title of "oldest" to the Bhakra Nangal Dam.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of both global and national infrastructure projects.


**4. With reference to Nidhi Companies, consider the following statements:**

1. Nidhi companies are required to maintain a minimum net owned fund of ₹1 crore to commence operations.
2.  Nidhi companies are primarily regulated under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934, and are permitted to accept deposits from the general public.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nidhi companies need substantial capital, the specific minimum net owned fund requirement is not ₹1 crore.  The actual minimum requirement is stipulated under Section 406 of the Companies Act, 2013, and may differ from the stated figure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Nidhi companies are not regulated under the RBI Act. Their primary regulatory framework is Section 406 of the Companies Act, 2013. Importantly, they are *not* permitted to accept deposits from the general public; their lending and borrowing activities are restricted to their members.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the regulatory environment and operational features of Nidhi companies.  A clear understanding of the Companies Act's role in regulating Nidhi companies is essential.


**5. With reference to Precision Farming, consider the following statements:**

1. Precision farming techniques primarily utilize advanced technologies like GPS, remote sensing, and GIS but exclude the use of traditional farming knowledge and practices.
2.  One of the major challenges in implementing precision farming in India is the diverse agro-climatic conditions across the country, which require region-specific adaptations of technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Precision farming does not entirely disregard traditional farming knowledge.  It integrates modern technologies with local knowledge and experience to optimize resource use and enhance efficiency. The statement wrongly suggests an exclusion of traditional practices.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's diverse agro-climatic conditions present a significant challenge to the widespread adoption of precision farming.  The technologies and techniques need to be tailored to suit the specific needs of various regions, increasing the complexity and cost of implementation.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a key challenge in the Indian context.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The paper's finding regarding the combined GDP contribution of the five specified states is approximately 30 percent, not 40 percent as stated.  This highlights the importance of precise numerical data in economic analysis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both Gujarat and Maharashtra are economically strong states, the claim that their per capita incomes have *consistently* exceeded the national average since the 1960s is not entirely accurate according to the paper.  There may have been periods where this was not the case.   Therefore, neither statement accurately represents the findings of the EAC-PM paper.   Precision in interpreting economic data is crucial.


**7. With reference to the Naga King Chili, consider the following statements:**

1. The Naga King Chili holds a Guinness World Record for being the world's hottest chili pepper.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Naga King Chili is indeed exceptionally hot, it does not hold the Guinness World Record for being the *world's* hottest chili pepper.  The record is held by other chili varieties. The statement misrepresents the chili's ranking.

Statement 2 is correct. The Naga King Chili did receive the GI tag in 2008, and its cultivation is concentrated in the northeastern states of India.  The statement accurately describes its geographical indication and main cultivation area. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, demonstrating the importance of verifying claims related to specific products and their certifications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Windfall taxes share characteristics with Pigouvian taxes.  Pigouvian taxes are designed to internalize negative externalities, and windfall taxes can be viewed as a way to capture unexpected gains that might otherwise not be taxed adequately, thus mitigating potential market distortions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Windfall taxes are indeed levied on companies that experience unexpected profits due to external factors beyond their control. These are typically temporary measures targeting specific sectors experiencing windfall gains.  Therefore, both statements offer accurate descriptions of certain aspects of windfall tax.


**9. With reference to the Indian Dairy Sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the world's largest producer of milk, surpassing all other countries in total milk production.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a leading milk producer globally, it is not the *largest*.  Other countries, such as India, have higher total milk production volumes. The statement misrepresents India's position in global milk production.

Statement 2 is correct. Operation Flood is widely credited with significantly increasing milk production in India and creating a robust cooperative infrastructure for the dairy industry. This initiative transformed the Indian dairy sector. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, highlighting the importance of knowing India's ranking in various sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. White Revolution 2.0 aims to achieve a daily milk procurement target of 1000 lakh kilograms by 2029, with a clear emphasis on empowering women in the dairy sector. This is a stated objective of the initiative.

Statement 2 is correct. Margdarshika indeed aims to establish 5 lakh new Multi-Purpose Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS), covering dairy and fishery cooperatives, by 2029. This is a key component of the program's expansion strategy.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the goals of these initiatives within the Indian cooperative sector.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is chaired by the Union Finance Minister, not the President of India. The President does not actively participate in the day-to-day functioning of the GST Council.

Statement 2 is correct. The GST was indeed introduced in 2017 through the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016, bringing a significant restructuring to India's indirect tax system.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.  The correct identification of the GST Council's chairperson is important.


**12. Consider the following statements about future and options contracts in the share market:**

1.  Future contracts are agreements to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on a future date, while options contracts give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specific date.
2. Both future and option contracts are standardized contracts traded on exchanges and their prices are solely determined by the market forces of supply and demand, without any influence from the underlying asset's price.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  This statement accurately defines future and option contracts, highlighting the key difference between the obligation in futures and the right (but not obligation) in options contracts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While future and option contracts are standardized and traded on exchanges, their prices are *directly* influenced by the price of the underlying asset.  The market forces of supply and demand are certainly at play, but they are fundamentally tied to the value of the underlying asset. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**13. Which among the following sectors are NOT eligible for priority sector lending (PSL)?**

(a) Agriculture and allied activities
(b) Education and renewable energy
(c) Export-oriented units and infrastructure
(d) Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (b), and (d) represent sectors that are generally eligible for priority sector lending.  The RBI's PSL guidelines cover a range of sectors aimed at promoting inclusive growth.

Option (c) is the correct answer. While some export-oriented units or infrastructure projects might indirectly benefit from PSL through related activities, export-oriented units and infrastructure are not explicitly classified as priority sectors for direct PSL. The RBI's specific guidelines determine eligibility.


**14. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Silk Board is a statutory body under the Ministry of Textiles, responsible for the development and promotion of the silk industry in India.
2. India is the world's second-largest silk producer, contributing significantly to global silk production.
3. Karnataka is the leading silk-producing state in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Central Silk Board is indeed a statutory body, but it falls under the Ministry of Textiles, not the Ministry of Agriculture.

Statement 2 is correct. India is a major global silk producer, holding a significant share of the international market.

Statement 3 is correct. Karnataka is the largest producer of silk among Indian states.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**15. Consider the following statements:**

1. China is the world's largest rice producer, followed by India.
2. India is the world's largest exporter of rice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both China and India are major rice producers, China holds the top position in global rice production, followed by India and other countries.  The order of producers is incorrectly presented.

Statement 2 is correct. India consistently ranks as the world's leading exporter of rice, a significant component of its agricultural exports.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.  The correct ranking of rice producers is important to note.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) receives contributions solely from the Public Provident Fund (PPF).
2.  The NSSF is a crucial source of funding for the Food Corporation of India (FCI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Public Provident Fund (PPF) is *one* of the small savings instruments contributing to the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), it's not the sole contributor.  The NSSF encompasses various other small savings schemes like National Savings Certificates (NSC), Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP), and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.  The question attempts to mislead by implying a singular source of funding.

Statement 2 is correct. The NSSF, managed by the central government, pools funds from various small savings schemes.  A significant portion of these accumulated savings is utilized to finance the operations of government agencies, including the FCI, which is crucial for managing India's food security.  The government uses the NSSF as a source of non-debt creating capital receipts, thereby reducing its reliance on market borrowings.  This demonstrates an important aspect of India's fiscal management.


**2. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Goods and Services Tax Council's recommendations on GST-related matters are binding on Parliament but not on State Legislatures.
2. The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act of 2016 introduced the GST, subsuming all existing indirect taxes, including surcharges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GST Council is a recommendatory body; its decisions are not legally binding on either Parliament or State Legislatures. The Council's recommendations are crucial for maintaining fiscal federalism, but the ultimate legislative power rests with the Union and State legislatures.  The question creates confusion by suggesting a direct binding power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GST did indeed subsume many indirect taxes, but not *all*.  Certain specific taxes and cess remained outside the GST ambit.  Surcharges, in particular, were not completely subsumed under GST, although some elements may be integrated. The statement attempts to mislead by claiming complete subsumption of all indirect taxes.  This highlights the complexity of India's tax system and the phased implementation of the GST.


**3. With reference to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1.  PACS are connected to the Core Banking Software (CBS), ensuring seamless integration with State Cooperative Banks (SCBs) and District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs).
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) primarily function to provide short-term crop loans directly to farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While SCBs and DCCBs are generally connected to the Core Banking Software (CBS), PACS, being at the village level, often lack this connectivity.  This digital divide is a significant challenge in improving the efficiency and reach of rural credit systems. The statement tries to mislead by implying universal CBS connectivity for PACS.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DCCBs do not directly provide short-term crop loans to farmers; that's the primary function of PACS. DCCBs act as intermediaries, channeling funds from SCBs to PACS, which then lend directly to farmers.  The statement incorrectly attributes the direct lending function to DCCBs.  This highlights the three-tiered cooperative credit structure in India and the challenges in efficient fund flow within this system.



**4. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), consider the following statements:**

1. SEBI was established in 1992 and granted statutory powers through the SEBI Act of 1988.
2. SEBI's primary regulatory function extends to protecting investor interests in the securities market, but not to regulating capital markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SEBI was indeed given statutory powers through the SEBI Act of 1992, but it was established earlier, in 1988. The order of establishment and the granting of statutory powers is reversed in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEBI's mandate explicitly includes protecting investor interests and regulating both the securities market and the capital market to ensure orderly functioning.  The statement attempts to create a false distinction between SEBI's regulatory scope, which is broader than what is suggested.  This highlights the crucial role of SEBI in maintaining the integrity and stability of India's financial markets.


**5. With reference to the Union Budget's fiscal deficit, consider the following statements:**

1. The fiscal deficit is calculated as the difference between total expenditure and total receipts, including borrowings.
2. Andhra Pradesh consistently maintains the highest share of India’s GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The fiscal deficit is calculated as the excess of total budget expenditure (revenue and capital) over total budget receipts (revenue and capital) *excluding* borrowings.  Including borrowings would misrepresent the actual deficit. The statement introduces a misleading element in the calculation of fiscal deficit.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Andhra Pradesh contributes significantly to India's GDP, it does not consistently maintain the highest share.  Maharashtra has historically held this position for most of the period under consideration. The statement provides an incorrect factual claim about the relative economic performance of Indian states.  This highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of India's economic growth and the relative contributions of different states.


**6.  With reference to dark patterns, consider the following statements:**

1. Dark patterns are deceptive online tactics employed by platforms to manipulate user choices, falling under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.
2.  The Three Gorges Dam in China is the oldest hydroelectric power plant in the world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dark patterns are indeed deceptive design choices used by online companies to manipulate user behavior, often to increase revenue at the expense of the user.  These practices are considered unethical and fall under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, as unfair trade practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Three Gorges Dam in China is the *largest* hydroelectric power station globally, but it is not the oldest. The oldest hydroelectric power plant is located in India (Sidrapong, West Bengal). The statement attempts to mislead by confusing size and age.  This highlights the importance of understanding the global context of energy production and the historical development of hydroelectric power.


**7. With reference to Nidhi companies, consider the following statements:**

1. Nidhi companies are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and require a minimum capital of ₹1 crore.
2.  Precision farming utilizes information technology to optimize crop health and soil management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nidhi companies are governed by the Companies Act, 2013, not the RBI, and their minimum capital requirement is ₹10 lakh, not ₹1 crore. The statement provides incorrect regulatory oversight and capital requirements.

Statement 2 is correct. Precision farming leverages information technology, including GPS, remote sensing, and variable rate technology, to tailor inputs to specific locations within a field, maximizing efficiency and minimizing waste.  This demonstrates the application of technology in agriculture and the move towards sustainable farming practices.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1. India is the world's largest milk producer, contributing 24% of global milk production in 2021-22.
2. The White Revolution 2.0 aims to increase milk procurement to 1000 lakh kg/day by 2029 and focuses on establishing 5 lakh new PACS.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India is indeed the world's largest milk producer, holding a 24% share of global production in 2021-22. This reflects India's significant contribution to the global dairy sector and the success of initiatives like Operation Flood.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While White Revolution 2.0 does aim to increase milk procurement to 1000 lakh kg/day by 2029 and emphasizes women's empowerment, it targets the establishment of 2 lakh new PACS, not 5 lakh. The number of new PACS targeted is incorrect.  This illustrates the ongoing efforts to modernize and expand India's dairy sector.


**9. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279A, with the Union Finance Minister as its Chairperson.
2. The GST Council decides the levy date for petroleum crude, high-speed diesel, motor spirit (petrol), natural gas, and aviation turbine fuel.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST Council's formation and composition, as a constitutional body under Article 279A, with the Union Finance Minister as Chairperson, are accurately described. This reflects the federal nature of the GST system in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The GST Council does have the authority to determine the date from which these petroleum products will be brought under the GST ambit. Though it is still under discussion. This reflects the Council’s power in making policy decisions related to GST.


**10. With reference to the Green Credit Program (GCP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Green Credit Program (GCP) operates under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, and primarily benefits industries.
2. Green Credits, unlike carbon credits, encompass a broader range of environment-positive actions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCP operates under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, not the Energy Conservation Act, 2001. While industries can participate, the GCP's scope extends to a wider range of stakeholders, including individuals and communities.  The statement mistakenly links the GCP to the wrong act and implies a narrower scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  Green Credits are indeed broader than carbon credits.  While carbon credits focus solely on carbon emission reduction, green credits encompass a wider array of environment-friendly actions, which may include actions that contribute to carbon credit generation.  The statement accurately highlights the distinction between these two environmental incentive mechanisms.


**11. With reference to Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), consider the following statements:**

1. KVKs are primarily funded by State Governments and function under State Agricultural Universities (SAUs).
2. The first KVK was established in 1974 at Puducherry under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), Coimbatore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. KVKs are 100% centrally funded by the Government of India and are an integral part of the National Agricultural Research System (NARS), which comprises ICAR at the national level and SAUs at the state level. Though SAUs play a role in their functioning. The question attempts to mislead by incorrectly stating the funding source and primary administrative body.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The first KVK was indeed established in 1974 at Puducherry, but it was under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), Coimbatore. The statement is partially correct, but the location is misleading. This highlights the role of KVKs in agricultural extension and technology transfer.


**12. With reference to the Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH), consider the following statements:**

1. The Spices Board India, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, serves as the Secretariat for CCSCH.
2. Codex standards are legally binding on national food legislation of all WTO member countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Spices Board India, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, does indeed serve as the Secretariat organization for the CCSCH. This highlights India's role in international spice standards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Codex standards are voluntary, not legally binding on national food legislation.  While the WTO encourages harmonization with international standards, countries retain the right to set their own food safety and quality regulations. The statement incorrectly asserts the binding nature of Codex standards.  This highlights the difference between international recommendations and national legal obligations.


**13. With reference to Fintech in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India possesses the world’s third-largest FinTech ecosystem, with over 3000 registered FinTech startups.
2. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) primarily focuses on expanding the scope of TReDS to include insurance companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India’s FinTech ecosystem is indeed among the world's largest, possessing a significant number of registered FinTech startups.  This reflects India’s growing digital economy and its potential for financial inclusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the RBI has expanded TReDS to include insurance companies, this is a separate initiative from ONDC. ONDC aims to create open networks for digital commerce across various sectors, not specifically focusing on expanding TReDS.  The statement confuses the roles of ONDC and the expansion of TReDS.  This highlights the various initiatives undertaken to promote digitalization in India's financial and commercial sectors.


**14. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) 2024 mandates that brand names of other companies must be used in drug advertisements with prior consent.
2. The Agri Infrastructure Fund (AIF) provides financial assistance to farmers, self-help groups, PACS, and FPOs, offering a 3% interest subvention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UCPMP 2024, released by the Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, indeed stipulates that using the brand names of other companies in drug promotions requires prior consent.  This aims to prevent misleading advertising and unfair competition.

Statement 2 is correct. The AIF, launched under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, does provide financial assistance to various stakeholders including farmers, SHGs, PACS, and FPOs, with a 3% interest subvention on loans.  This highlights the government's efforts to improve agricultural infrastructure and support farmers.


**15. With reference to the  Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS), consider the following statements:**

1. The FFS, established in 2016, has a corpus of ₹10,000 crore and is monitored by SIDBI.
2.  StartupShala, a flagship program of Startup India, is a three-month accelerator program with cohorts focused on clean and deep technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the FFS was established in 2016 with a corpus of ₹10,000 crore, it is monitored by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), not SIDBI. SIDBI is the operating agency. The statement incorrectly identifies the monitoring agency.

Statement 2 is correct. StartupShala, under Startup India (DPIIT), is a three-month accelerator program, indeed focusing on clean and deep technologies.  This highlights the government's initiatives to nurture India's startup ecosystem.


**16. With reference to the Information Technology Act, 2000, consider the following statements:**

1. The IT Act, 2000, comprehensively addresses contemporary challenges in the digital ecosystem.
2. The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme provides ₹6000 annually to all landholding farmers, with exceptions for certain high-income groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IT Act, 2000, is a foundational law governing India's digital space, it was enacted before many current challenges emerged, requiring sector-specific regulations. The statement overstates the IT Act's comprehensiveness in addressing contemporary issues.

Statement 2 is correct. The PM-Kisan scheme does provide an annual income support of ₹6000 to eligible landholding farmer families, excluding those above a certain income threshold. This highlights a key government initiative to support farmers' income.


**17. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) replaced the Restructured Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS).
2.  The PMFBY covers all cereals, millets, pulses, and oilseeds for both rabi and kharif seasons, with premium payments determined by the actuarial premium rate (APR) or 5% of sum assured, whichever is lower.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMFBY replaced the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) and Modified NAIS, but RWBCIS continues to operate alongside PMFBY. The statement wrongly identifies the scheme replaced by PMFBY.

Statement 2 is correct. The PMFBY does cover the specified crops for both seasons, with premium payments based on the lower of the APR or 5% of sum assured, with variations for specific crops and regions. This highlights the features of India's crop insurance scheme.


**18. With reference to the Micro & Small Enterprises Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP), consider the following statements:**

1. The MSE-CDP provides 60% or 70% central government funding for Common Facility Centres (CFCs) and 50% or 60% for Infrastructure Development (ID), with additional assistance for specific categories of clusters.
2. The PM Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) provides financial assistance to only new units and has an income ceiling for project assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MSE-CDP funding structure accurately reflects the central and state government's shared responsibility, and the additional incentives for specific clusters.  This showcases a nuanced approach to supporting MSMEs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PMEGP provides financial assistance to new units, but it *does not* have an income ceiling.  The statement incorrectly introduces an income restriction.  This highlights the government's employment generation program.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer, a detailed explanation (over 100 words), and analysis of why other options are incorrect.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, introduced in 2017,  consolidated multiple indirect taxes into a single system with four tax slabs: 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.  The 28% slab attracts an additional cess.
2.  The cess levied under the GST is a tax on luxury goods only, collected by the Central Government and transferred directly to the States' Consolidated Funds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The GST did indeed consolidate numerous indirect taxes into a four-slab structure (5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%), with the highest slab attracting a cess. However, the description is slightly misleading as it implies a straightforward application of the cess only to the 28% slab. While a significant portion of the 28% slab comprises luxury items,  the cess also applies to demerit and sin goods, which are not explicitly mentioned. This makes option (c) incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The cess levied on the highest GST slab is indeed collected by the Central Government, but  it's not exclusively a tax on luxury goods; it also applies to demerit and sin goods. Furthermore, while a portion of the cess revenue is allocated to the states, the statement incorrectly claims that all cess revenue is directly transferred to the States' Consolidated Funds.  The distribution formula is more complex than this simplistic description.  This makes option (b) incorrect.  Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is largely correct. Therefore, only statement 1 is largely correct, making (a) the most appropriate answer. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to identify subtle inaccuracies in the statements.



**2. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  PSL, mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), requires commercial banks to allocate a specific percentage of their total lending to agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and export credit, with no other sectors included.
2. The RBI regularly updates the list of sectors eligible for PSL, but the loan limits for each sector remain static and unchanged over time.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PSL does mandate a certain percentage of lending to agriculture, MSMEs, and export credit, it also includes other sectors such as education, housing, social infrastructure, and renewable energy. The statement's exclusion of these sectors is a key distractor. Option (a) is incorrect because of this inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The RBI does periodically review and update the list of eligible sectors for PSL, and it also adjusts the loan limits for each sector based on evolving economic priorities and needs. The statement's claim of static loan limits is a deliberate attempt to mislead. Option (b) is incorrect due to this falsehood.  Option (c) is incorrect as both statements are false. Thus, the correct answer is (d), testing factual recall and analytical skills.


**3. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  SEBI's regulatory purview extends to stock exchanges, mutual funds, and credit rating agencies, but excludes the regulation of  venture capital funds.
2. SEBI is responsible for designating Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) but does not have the authority to hear appeals related to its own orders.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SEBI's regulatory powers encompass a wide range of financial instruments and entities, including stock exchanges, mutual funds, credit rating agencies, and importantly, venture capital funds. The exclusion of venture capital funds in the statement is a misleading element designed to confuse.  Option (a) is incorrect due to this error.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. SEBI does indeed designate Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI).  However, the statement incorrectly asserts that SEBI lacks the power to hear appeals. SEBI has an appellate mechanism, and while the final appeal may lie with higher courts, SEBI itself does handle appeals from its initial orders. This makes option (b) incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect since both statements are untrue. Therefore, the correct answer is (d), testing factual recall.


**4. With reference to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The PAC, established in 1937, primarily examines the annual audit reports submitted by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), focusing solely on financial irregularities.
2. The PAC's mandate extends to reviewing the performance of regulatory bodies established by an Act of Parliament, including bodies like the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the PAC does examine the CAG's reports, its scope is broader than just identifying financial irregularities. It also examines the efficiency and effectiveness of government spending and policies. The statement's narrow focus on financial irregularities is a misleading aspect. Option (a) is incorrect because of this oversimplification.

Statement 2 is correct. The PAC's mandate does include reviewing the performance of parliamentary regulatory bodies, which includes SEBI. This aspect of the PAC's work is less prominently highlighted in the source material, making it a challenging element for the candidate. Option (b) is correct. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the PAC's role.



**5. With reference to the Central Silk Board (CSB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CSB, a statutory body established in 1948, operates under the Ministry of Agriculture and is responsible for the development of India's silk industry.
2. India is the world's largest producer of silk, producing all four major varieties of silk – Mulberry, Eri, Tassar, and Muga.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CSB was indeed established in 1948 and is responsible for the development of India's silk industry, it operates under the Ministry of Textiles, not the Ministry of Agriculture. This difference is a crucial distractor. Option (a) is thus incorrect.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While India does produce all four major varieties of silk mentioned, it is *not* the world's largest producer. China holds that position.  This factual inaccuracy is designed to test the candidate's knowledge. Option (b) is incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because both statements are false.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d), primarily assessing factual recall.


**6. With reference to rice production and export, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is the world's second-largest producer of rice, followed by India, China, and Indonesia.
2.  India's share of global rice exports in 2023 was approximately 42%.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The order of the world's largest rice producers is China, India, Bangladesh, and then Indonesia.  The incorrect ordering of the producers is a key distractor. Option (a) is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. India's share of global rice exports in 2023 was approximately 33%, not 42%. This is a deliberate numerical error to challenge the candidate. Option (b) is therefore incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because both statements are false.  The correct answer is (d), testing factual recall.



**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Inner Line Permit (ILP) regime in India:**

1. The ILP regime is applicable to all states in Northeast India, barring Sikkim.
2.  The ILP system restricts the entry of Indians from other states into the protected areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ILP regime is not applicable to all states in Northeast India. It is implemented in specific states like Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Manipur.  The statement's overgeneralization is a deliberate attempt to mislead. Option (a) is thus incorrect.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The ILP system restricts the entry of *non-residents*, not necessarily Indians from other states, into the designated areas.  This subtle but important distinction is a distractor. Option (b) is incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect as both statements are false.  The correct answer is (d), testing factual recall and nuanced understanding of the ILP system.


**8. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI was established in 1946 as the Special Police Establishment (SPE) and initially functioned under the Ministry of Finance.
2.  The CBI's investigative jurisdiction extends to all states in India without requiring prior consent from the state governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The CBI did originate from the SPE in 1946.  However, it initially operated under the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of Finance. This is a significant detail intended to confuse.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CBI requires the prior consent of state governments to conduct investigations within their respective jurisdictions.  Without this consent, its powers are limited.  The statement's assertion of unrestricted jurisdiction is false and designed as a distractor.  Option (b) is incorrect, and option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is false.  The correct answer is (a), testing factual recall and understanding of the CBI's limitations.


**9. With reference to the Collegium system for judicial appointments in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The collegium system is explicitly mentioned and detailed in Article 217 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The government of India can reject the collegium's recommendations for judicial appointments, but it cannot seek clarifications or further information on the selected candidates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The collegium system is *not* explicitly mentioned in Article 217 of the Constitution.  Article 217 deals with the appointment and removal of High Court judges. The collegium system evolved through judicial pronouncements and precedents. This is a significant detail designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the constitutional basis of the Collegium.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the government can indeed reject the collegium's recommendations, it is not entirely true that it cannot seek clarifications.  The government can, and often does, seek further information or reasons for the Collegium's choices, although the extent of this power is a subject of ongoing debate and judicial pronouncements.  The statement's absolute assertion is a distractor. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.  The correct answer is (d), testing knowledge of the Collegium system and its constitutional ambiguity.


**10. With reference to contempt of court in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt includes acts that scandalize the court or lower its authority.  Punishment for contempt can include both imprisonment and fines.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has the sole and exclusive power to initiate and punish contempt of court proceedings in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The description accurately defines civil and criminal contempt and correctly states that the punishment for contempt can include both imprisonment and fines.  This is a straightforward test of factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has significant power in contempt cases, it does not hold the *sole* and *exclusive* power.  High Courts also have the jurisdiction to initiate and punish contempt of court proceedings within their respective jurisdictions.  The statement's assertion of exclusive power is a major distractor. Option (b) is incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is true.  Therefore, the correct option is (a). The question tests factual recall and understanding of the judicial hierarchy in India.


**11. With reference to safeguards for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 17 of the Indian Constitution abolishes untouchability and its practice, while Article 338 establishes the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.
2. Article 46 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of society, including Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 17 abolishes untouchability, which is correct. However, Article 338 establishes the National Commission for *Scheduled Castes*, not Scheduled Tribes (that is established by Article 338A).  This error is designed to mislead the candidate. Option (a) is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 46 accurately reflects the constitutional directive on promoting the educational and economic interests of weaker sections, including Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  This is a straightforward test of factual recall. Option (b) is correct. Option (c) is incorrect due to the error in statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is correct.  The question tests factual recall of constitutional provisions and their application to social justice issues.


**12. With reference to the withdrawal of general consent to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  A state government withdrawing general consent to the CBI effectively prevents the CBI from investigating any crime within that state's jurisdiction.
2.  The withdrawal of general consent by a state government is a recent phenomenon, only occurring after the enactment of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act of 2013.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The withdrawal of general consent by a state government does *not* completely prevent CBI investigations.  The CBI can still investigate cases within that state if it obtains specific consent for a particular case or if the case falls under specific central laws. The statement's absolute assertion is a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The withdrawal of general consent is not a recent phenomenon post-2013.  States have exercised this power for many years. The statement attempts to create a false temporal link.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect. The correct answer is (d), testing knowledge of the CBI's operational constraints and the history of state-center relations.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the  'Right to Repair' initiative in India:**

1. The 'Right to Repair' initiative mandates that manufacturers must provide repair manuals and spare parts to consumers free of cost.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Right to Repair initiative encourages manufacturers to provide repair manuals and spare parts, but it doesn't mandate that these must be provided free of cost.  The statement incorrectly implies a mandatory free provision, serving as a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The mentioned sectors are accurately identified as those initially included in the Right to Repair initiative's scope.  This tests factual recall regarding specific sectors. Option (a) is incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true. The correct answer is (b), assessing factual recall and understanding of government policy.


**14. With reference to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) of the European Union (EU), consider the following statements:**

1. CBAM aims to reduce carbon emissions in the EU by imposing tariffs on carbon-intensive goods imported from non-EU countries, regardless of whether those countries have their own carbon pricing mechanisms.
2.  The CBAM is designed to be fully compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, ensuring there are no trade disputes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CBAM does impose costs on carbon-intensive imports, it allows for deductions if the non-EU producer has already paid carbon emission fees in their own country. The statement omits this crucial aspect of the mechanism.  Option (a) is incorrect.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The compatibility of CBAM with WTO rules is a subject of ongoing debate and potential future disputes. The statement's assertion of guaranteed compatibility is a significant distractor. Option (b) is incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because both statements are false.  The correct answer is (d), testing factual recall and understanding of international trade law and environmental policies.


**15.  With reference to Debt for Climate Swaps, consider the following statements:**

1.  Debt for climate swaps involve debtor nations using their foreign currency reserves to repay external debts by financing domestic climate projects.
2.  India has actively participated in several debt for climate swaps, primarily focusing on ocean conservation projects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Debt for climate swaps involve debtor nations using *local* currency, not foreign currency reserves, to finance domestic climate projects in lieu of external debt repayment.  The incorrect specification of currency is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. India has *not* participated in any debt for climate swaps as of the date of the source text.  This factual inaccuracy is a key element in assessing the candidate's knowledge. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect. The correct answer is (d), testing factual recall about a specific country's participation in a global financial instrument.


**16. With reference to the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Strategy on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships, consider the following statements:**

1. The IMO Strategy mandates that the shipping industry must reduce its CO2 emissions by at least 50% by 2030 compared to 2008 levels.
2.  India’s ‘Harit Sagar’ Green Port Guidelines 2023 are aligned with the IMO's Strategy, aiming to make India a global hub for green shipping by 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMO Strategy sets a target of at least 40% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 2008 levels, not 50%. This numerical discrepancy is intended as a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  India’s ‘Harit Sagar’ guidelines and its aim to become a green shipping hub by 2030 are in line with the IMO's long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050. This assesses knowledge of national and international environmental policies. Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.  The correct answer is (b), testing factual recall and policy linkage.



**17. With reference to the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NFCS in India was proposed under the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) serving as the nodal agency.  Other countries like Switzerland and China have similar NFCS frameworks.
2.  The primary objective of NFCS is to enhance the capacity of the IMD to provide accurate weather forecasts for the agricultural sector, with limited focus on climate change adaptation strategies.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015,  did lead to a significant increase in coal production, as evidenced by the fact that production crossed one billion tonnes in FY 2023-24.  The statement's assertion of no significant increase is a false distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, did indeed introduce the Composite PL-cum-ML for coal, simplifying the licensing process.  This is a direct test of factual knowledge. Option (a) is incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true. The correct answer is (b), assessing factual recall and understanding of coal sector reforms.

**1. With reference to the Krishna Water Dispute, consider the following statements:**

1. The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-I (KWDT-I) was established in 1969 under the Interstate River Water Disputes Act, 1956, primarily to address disputes between Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.
2. The KWDT-II, instituted in 2004, is tasked with re-allocating Krishna river water amongst Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh, considering the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-I (KWDT-I) was indeed established in 1969 under the Interstate River Water Disputes Act, 1956.  Its primary mandate was to resolve water-sharing disputes among the then-existing riparian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.  The act provides a mechanism for the adjudication of water disputes between states.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Following the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh into Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the need arose to re-allocate the Krishna river water previously allocated to the undivided state. KWDT-II was therefore instituted to address this new distribution requirement among the four states.  The creation of Telangana introduced a new dimension to the existing water-sharing agreement, necessitating a reassessment of water allocation.  The tribunal's role is crucial in ensuring equitable distribution and preventing future conflicts.


**2. With reference to the Riparian Principles and the Krishna River, consider the following statements:**

1. Riparian principles, which grant the right to use water to landowners adjacent to a water body, are the sole basis for water allocation in the Krishna River basin.
2. The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal's decisions supersede the application of Riparian Principles in determining water allocation among the riparian states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While riparian principles form a foundational concept in water rights, they are not the *sole* basis for water allocation in the Krishna River basin.  The Krishna River's interstate nature necessitates a more complex approach involving inter-state agreements and tribunal decisions.  Riparian rights are often considered alongside other factors like historical usage, needs of different states, and overall water availability.  A purely riparian approach would be insufficient to manage a river shared by multiple states with diverse needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal's decisions, reached after thorough investigation and adjudication, legally override the simple application of riparian principles. The tribunal's rulings establish a legally binding framework for water allocation, superseding any claims based solely on adjacency to the river.  This is a crucial aspect of managing interstate water resources effectively and fairly.  The tribunals' decisions are backed by legal authority and are designed to ensure equitable distribution.


**3. With reference to the appointment of judges in the higher judiciary of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Collegium system, which governs judicial appointments, is explicitly defined and enshrined within the Constitution of India.
2. The government's role in judicial appointments is limited to raising objections and seeking clarifications from the Collegium; however, the government's final approval is required for appointments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Collegium system is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. It has evolved through Supreme Court judgments (the "Judges Cases" of 1981, 1993, and 1998). While Articles 124(2) and 217 deal with the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts respectively, they don't prescribe the specific Collegium mechanism.  The system is a judicial creation based on interpretations of constitutional provisions and the need for judicial independence.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the government can raise objections and seek clarifications, its final approval is *not* required.  If the Collegium reiterates its recommendations despite government objections, the government is bound by Supreme Court pronouncements to make the appointments.  The government's role is primarily one of consultation and scrutiny, not of ultimate decision-making power, to maintain the judiciary's independence.


**4. With reference to the All India Judicial Services (AIJS), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIJS, if implemented, would decentralize the recruitment of judges at the level of additional district judges and district judges, assigning recruitment responsibilities to individual states.
2. The constitutional provision for the AIJS, included in Article 312, is currently fully operational, ensuring a uniform and centralized recruitment process across all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIJS, if implemented, aims to *centralize*, not decentralize, the recruitment of judges at the levels of additional district judges and district judges.  The current system involves state-level processes, and the AIJS seeks to create a uniform national recruitment process, enhancing consistency and potentially improving the quality of judicial appointments across the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 312 provides the constitutional basis for the AIJS, it is *not* currently fully operational.  The provision requires a parliamentary bill to define its details and establish the mechanism for recruitment.  Therefore, the AIJS remains a proposed reform, not a functioning reality.  Its implementation requires further legislative action.


**5. With reference to Legal Aid in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Legal Services Authorities (LSA) Act, 1987, established the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) and State Legal Services Authorities (SALSAs), but not District Legal Services Authorities (DLSA).
2. The Supreme Court Legal Services Committee (SCLSC) is responsible for implementing the DISHA scheme, which utilizes technology to enhance access to legal aid.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LSA Act, 1987, established a three-tiered structure for legal aid delivery: NALSA at the national level, SALSAs at the state level, and DLSAs at the district level.  All three tiers are integral parts of the legal aid mechanism outlined in the Act.  The Act aims to provide a comprehensive framework to reach marginalized communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCLSC plays a significant role in providing legal services, it is not responsible for implementing the DISHA scheme.  The DISHA scheme is an initiative of the Department of Justice, aimed at leveraging technology to improve legal aid access.  The SCLSC focuses on providing direct legal assistance, while DISHA focuses on broader access and awareness initiatives.


**6. With reference to the Mediation Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates that all civil and commercial disputes must be attempted through mediation before approaching a court.
2. The Mediation Council of India (MCI), established under the Act, will have only full-time members with expertise in mediation or ADR.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mediation Act, 2023, promotes mediation as a preferred method of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), but it does *not* mandate that *all* civil and commercial disputes must be attempted through mediation before approaching court.  The Act encourages pre-litigation mediation but doesn't make it compulsory for all cases.  The choice to use mediation remains with the disputing parties.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCI, while primarily comprising members with expertise in mediation or ADR, also includes part-time members such as the Law Secretary and the Expenditure Secretary, and ex-officio members.  The inclusion of these members reflects the government's involvement in the oversight of the mediation process.  The structure of the MCI is designed to balance expertise with government representation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

The Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba are indeed significant geographical features located within Jordan's territory. The statement accurately reflects Jordan's geopolitical position and its inclusion of these key geographical features.

Statement 2 is also correct. Amman, Jordan's capital, is situated near the Dead Sea. This proximity is a significant geographical factor, impacting Amman's development and its strategic importance within the region. While the term "strategically" might be open to interpretation, the geographical proximity is an undeniable fact.  The proximity to the Dead Sea is not just a matter of physical location but also has historical, economic, and perhaps even political implications.


**2. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Arabian Sea, a marginal sea of the Indian Ocean, experiences fewer cyclones annually compared to the Bay of Bengal, primarily due to its relatively cooler sea surface temperatures.
2. The formation of cyclones in the Arabian Sea is influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a climate pattern that can impact sea surface temperatures and wind patterns in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Arabian Sea generally experiences fewer cyclones than the Bay of Bengal, attributing this solely to cooler sea surface temperatures is an oversimplification.  Other factors like the availability of moisture, wind shear, and the Coriolis effect also play crucial roles in cyclone formation.  The statement presents a partially true fact but omits other significant contributing factors, making it inaccurate.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The IOD does influence weather patterns in the Arabian Sea, but its direct impact on cyclone *formation* is less pronounced than its effect on the intensity or track of existing cyclones.  The statement makes a connection that while partially true (IOD affects weather patterns), overstates the direct causal link between IOD and cyclone formation.

Statement 1 is correct. The Amazon River is indeed the world's largest river system by discharge volume. It originates in the Andes Mountains (specifically, the Peruvian Andes) and its vast water flow is a major factor in shaping the Amazon Basin's incredibly diverse ecosystem. The statement accurately reflects the Amazon's hydrological significance and its impact on the environment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Pantanal wetland is not located in the Amazon River basin; it's in the upper Paraguay River basin, a separate but equally significant South American river system.  The statement incorrectly associates the Pantanal with the Amazon River, creating a geographical inaccuracy that renders the statement false.


**4. With reference to the Paraguay River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pantanal, one of the world's largest tropical wetlands, is primarily located in the upper basin of the Paraguay River, contributing significantly to its biodiversity and ecological importance.
2. The Paraguay River, a major tributary of the Paraná River, flows through Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, playing a vital role in the region's water resources and transportation networks.

1. The Ring of Fire is primarily characterized by divergent plate boundaries, leading to the formation of mid-ocean ridges and volcanic activity along its length.
2.  The majority of the world's active volcanoes and the occurrence of significant earthquakes are concentrated along the Ring of Fire, a consequence of its location on convergent plate boundaries and subduction zones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ring of Fire is predominantly defined by *convergent* plate boundaries, where tectonic plates collide, not divergent boundaries (which cause seafloor spreading).  While some volcanic activity might occur near divergent boundaries, the Ring of Fire's volcanic activity is mainly due to subduction. The statement misrepresents the fundamental geological process driving the Ring of Fire's formation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ring of Fire is indeed renowned for its high concentration of active volcanoes and frequent, powerful earthquakes. This is a direct consequence of the subduction zones and convergent plate boundaries along its path.  The statement accurately describes the Ring of Fire's defining characteristics and their geological causes.


**6. With reference to the Heat Dome Effect, consider the following statements:**

1. The Heat Dome Effect is a high-pressure weather system that traps heat over a large land area, leading to prolonged periods of extreme heat and potentially dangerous heat waves.
2.  Heat domes typically form over oceans due to the high evaporation rates and the presence of warm ocean currents, resulting in intense heat being transferred to coastal regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A heat dome is a persistent, high-pressure weather system that traps warm air over a large land area, preventing its dispersal and leading to prolonged and intense heat waves.  This can cause significant risks to human health and the environment.  The statement accurately describes the mechanism and consequences of the Heat Dome Effect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Heat domes are predominantly associated with landmasses, not oceans. While warm ocean currents can certainly contribute to higher temperatures in coastal areas, the formation of a heat dome itself requires a specific high-pressure system that develops over land, trapping the heat. The statement incorrectly locates the formation of heat domes over oceans.


**7. With reference to the Polar Vortex, consider the following statements:**

1. The Polar Vortex is a high-pressure system that strengthens during summer and weakens during winter, influencing weather patterns in mid-latitude regions.

**1. With reference to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, consider the following statements:**

1. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are under the jurisdiction of the Madras High Court.
2. Saddle Peak, the highest point in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is located on the Great Nicobar Island.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are under the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, not the Madras High Court. The administrative and judicial boundaries don't always align geographically, and this is a classic example of that.  The historical reasons behind this jurisdiction are complex and related to the colonial administrative structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Saddle Peak, the highest peak in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is located on North Andaman Island, not Great Nicobar Island.  Great Nicobar Island holds Indira Point, India's southernmost point, but the highest elevation is found much further north in the archipelago.  Confusing the geographical location of the highest point with the southernmost point is a common error.


**2. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a continuation of the Arakan Yoma mountain range and were formed primarily by volcanic activity.
2.  The indigenous Negrito population of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is primarily concentrated on the Nicobar Islands.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are indeed a geologically southward extension of the Arakan Yoma mountain range. While volcanic activity played a role in shaping some of the islands (like Barren Island), the overall formation is more accurately described as a result of tectonic activity and the collision of the Indian and Burma plates.  The statement simplifies the complex geological history but captures the essence of the island's connection to the Arakan Yoma and the presence of volcanic formations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Negrito population, one of the oldest indigenous groups in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is primarily found on the Andaman Islands, not the Nicobar Islands. The Nicobar Islands have their own distinct indigenous populations like the Nicobarese, Shompen, and others.  The question attempts to misdirect by associating Negritos with the geographically separate Nicobar group.


**3. With reference to the geographical features of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, consider the following statements:**

1. The islands are characterized by extensive mangrove forests primarily located on the Nicobar group of islands.
2.  The Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve encompasses the entire Great Nicobar Island.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While mangrove forests are present in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, they are not primarily located on the Nicobar group. Mangroves are found in both the Andaman and Nicobar groups, but their distribution is influenced by specific coastal conditions.  The statement oversimplifies the distribution pattern, creating a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve does not encompass the *entire* Great Nicobar Island. It covers a significant portion, but not the whole island.  The reserve's boundaries are strategically defined to protect specific ecosystems and biodiversity hotspots within Great Nicobar. The statement uses a deceptive generalization to mislead.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The President of India holds the power to legislate directly for the Union Territories, including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, through ordinances or acts of Parliament. This reflects the unique constitutional position of Union Territories.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lieutenant Governor is the head of the administration of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This is a crucial aspect of the UT's governance structure, mirroring the role of a Governor in states, but with direct accountability to the President.  The President appoints the Lieutenant Governor, underscoring the central government's control.


**5. With reference to the biodiversity of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, consider the following statements:**

1. The islands are a recognized biodiversity hotspot and are home to the saltwater crocodile and the dugong.
2. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are characterized by only tropical wet evergreen forests.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are indeed a recognized biodiversity hotspot, renowned for their unique flora and fauna.  The presence of the saltwater crocodile and the dugong highlights the richness of their marine and coastal ecosystems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands possess a diverse range of forest types, including tropical wet evergreen forests, but also tropical moist deciduous forests and other types depending on the specific island and its geography.  The statement simplifies the complex forest ecosystem to mislead the candidate.  The variety of forest types is important to the region's overall biodiversity.

**1. With reference to the e-Shram portal and Universal Account Number (UAN), consider the following statements:**

1. The e-Shram portal's registration requires applicants to meet specific income thresholds.
2.  The UAN linked to the e-Shram portal is unique and remains unchanged, even if the worker changes jobs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The e-Shram portal, designed for unorganized sector workers in India, does *not* have any income criteria for registration.  Anyone working in the unorganized sector can register, irrespective of their earnings.  The aim is to create a comprehensive database of all unorganized workers.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the e-Shram portal is the provision of a Universal Account Number (UAN). This UAN acts as a unique identifier for each registered worker and remains consistent throughout their career, even if they switch employers or types of work within the unorganized sector. This ensures continuity and simplifies access to various government schemes and benefits.  The UAN is not directly tied to a specific employment, but rather to the individual worker themselves.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the facts concerning the e-Shram portal's registration process and the permanence of the UAN.


**2. With reference to the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA), consider the following statements:**

1. IEPFA is responsible for managing and disbursing funds related to unclaimed dividends and matured deposits.
2. IEPFA operates under the direct supervision of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IEPFA's primary function is to manage and disburse funds that represent unclaimed dividends, matured deposits, and other unclaimed amounts related to investments. These funds are transferred to IEPFA when they remain unclaimed for a specified period.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While IEPFA works within the financial regulatory landscape, it does *not* operate under the direct supervision of SEBI.  IEPFA functions under the aegis of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which is responsible for its overall oversight and policy direction.  SEBI's role is primarily focused on regulating the securities market, while IEPFA's focus is on investor protection related to unclaimed assets.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly state IEPFA's supervisory body or its functions.



**3. With reference to the AgriSURE Fund, consider the following statements:**

1. The AgriSURE Fund is a private sector initiative aimed at promoting sustainable farming practices.
2.  The fund primarily supports farmers in high-income states through grants for technology adoption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  The AgriSURE Fund (assuming this refers to a hypothetical or lesser-known fund, as a widely known fund with this name wasn't readily found)  is likely a government initiative, not a private sector one, aimed at broader agricultural investment and support for sustainable practices, encompassing farmers across various income levels.  It is improbable that it would focus solely on high-income states and highly unlikely to be managed by a consortium of universities rather than a government ministry or agency.  The nature of the fund's management and its target beneficiaries are misrepresented in the statements.

The Mid-day Meal Scheme is a separate initiative focused on providing meals to school children and is not directly subsumed under Samagra Shiksha. The NSDC is also a separate entity focused on skill development.  However, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) were indeed integrated into the Samagra Shiksha scheme, creating a more comprehensive school education framework.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correct.


**11. Consider the following statements with reference to the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar (PMRBP):**

1.  The awards are exclusively given to children from rural backgrounds for exceptional achievements in sports.
2.  The awardees receive a cash prize in addition to a medal and certificate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The PMRBP recognizes exceptional abilities and achievements in various fields, not just sports, and it is not limited to children from rural areas. While a medal and certificate are awarded, a cash prize is not typically part of the award.  The statements incorrectly restrict the award's scope and benefits.


**12. Consider the following statements with reference to the District Agro-Meteorology Units (DAMUs):**

1. DAMUs were established primarily to monitor seismic activity in agricultural regions.
2.  DAMUs are funded entirely by private agricultural companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. DAMUs are established by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to provide localized agricultural advisories based on weather data, not to monitor seismic activity.  They receive government funding, not solely from private companies. The statements misrepresent the function and funding of DAMUs.


**13. Consider the following statements with reference to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY):**

1. PM-KMY is a fully funded government scheme requiring no contribution from the farmers.
2.  The scheme provides a monthly pension of Rs. 10,000 after the age of 60.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. PM-KMY is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, requiring contributions from both the farmer and the government. The monthly pension amount is also different from what is mentioned. The statements misrepresent the funding and pension amount of PM-KMY.


**14. With reference to Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), consider the following statements:**

1. PMAY-G exclusively targets urban slum dwellers for providing affordable housing.
2. The scheme provides housing assistance only in the form of material support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. PMAY-G targets rural households for providing affordable housing, not urban slum dwellers. The scheme provides financial assistance, not only material support, to construct houses.  The statements misrepresent both the target beneficiaries and the type of assistance provided under PMAY-G.


**15. With reference to Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY), consider the following statements:**

1. AB PM-JAY covers pre- and post-hospitalization expenses for a period of 30 days.
2.  The scheme is implemented in all states and union territories of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. While AB PM-JAY does cover pre- and post-hospitalization expenses, the duration is not 30 days; it's shorter. Also, while implemented across most of India, there might be some states or UTs with variations in implementation.  The statements are inaccurate regarding the scope of coverage and implementation.


**16. Which of the following ministries is the nodal body implementing 'Mission Mausam'?**

(a) Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare
(b) Ministry of Earth Sciences
(c) Ministry of Science and Technology
(d) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

1. PMMSY aims to increase fish production to 30 million metric tons by 2030.
2.  The scheme is solely focused on promoting marine fisheries and ignores inland fisheries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. While PMMSY aims to significantly increase fish production, the target and timeframe mentioned are not accurate.  The scheme also encompasses both marine and inland fisheries, promoting sustainable development across the entire fisheries sector. The statements are inaccurate regarding the targets and scope of PMMSY.


**18. Saarthi App, recently launched by the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), is mainly aimed at:**

(a) Providing agricultural inputs to farmers.
(b) Facilitating digital payments for small businesses.
(c) Helping businesses create multilingual buyer apps.
(d) Promoting tourism in rural areas.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Saarthi App's primary goal is to assist businesses in developing multilingual buyer apps, thereby expanding their reach and accessibility to a wider customer base.  The other options are incorrect as they do not reflect the app's core functionality.

(a) Pashmina Wool Processing Unit
(b) Training for Bio-processing of local fruits
(c) Development of Solar Energy Production Units
(d) Establishment of a large-scale steel manufacturing plant

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CREATE initiative focuses on sustainable and locally relevant enterprises, not large-scale industrial projects.  A large steel plant would be outside the scope of this initiative.  The other options are plausible components of a program aimed at supporting local micro, small, and medium enterprises.


**20. BHASKAR initiative, recently seen in the news, primarily focuses on:**

(a) Promoting traditional Indian art forms.
(b) Strengthening India’s startup ecosystem.
(c) Developing a national digital library.
(d) Improving rural sanitation infrastructure.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The BHASKAR initiative is primarily aimed at bolstering India's startup ecosystem, providing support and resources to new ventures. The other options are unrelated to the initiative's core objectives.


**21. NPS Vatsalya Scheme, recently seen in the news, mainly focuses on:**

(a) Providing healthcare services to senior citizens.
(b) Securing the financial future of children.
(c) Promoting adult literacy programs.
(d) Supporting skill development initiatives for youth.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NPS Vatsalya Scheme is designed to help parents and guardians secure the financial future of their minor children through long-term investments in the National Pension System.  The other options are not related to the scheme's purpose.


**22. Samagra Shiksha, a centrally sponsored scheme, is in accordance with which of the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a) SDG-1 (No Poverty)
(b) SDG-2 (Zero Hunger)
(c) SDG-3 (Good Health and Well-being)
(d) SDG-4 (Quality Education)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Samagra Shiksha's focus on comprehensive school education directly aligns with SDG-4, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.  The other SDGs, while important, are not the primary focus of this specific scheme.


**23. Consider the following statements with reference to the ‘Rangeen Machhli’ app:**

1. The app provides information on only freshwater ornamental fish species.
2.  The app includes a feature to directly purchase fish online from registered sellers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are likely incorrect.  The app probably covers a wider range of ornamental fish species, including both freshwater and saltwater varieties.  Direct online purchasing is not a standard feature of such informational apps; it would require more complex integration with e-commerce platforms.


**24. With reference to the NPS Vatsalya Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme is exclusively for children from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes communities.
2.  Contributions made under the scheme are eligible for tax benefits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NPS Vatsalya Scheme is not limited to specific communities; it's available to all children.  Statement 2 is correct. Contributions made under the scheme are likely eligible for tax benefits under the prevailing income tax regulations.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct.


**25. With reference to the PM Vishwakarma Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme provides financial assistance for purchasing advanced machinery only.
2.  The scheme is exclusively for artisans working with traditional metals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  The PM Vishwakarma Scheme likely offers a broader range of support than just purchasing advanced machinery.  It also encompasses a wider range of traditional artisans and craftspeople, not just those working with metals. The statements are too narrow in their description of the scheme's scope.

**1. With reference to the PM Vishwakarma Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme provides financial assistance exclusively to artisans operating in the organized sector, offering them substantial grants for business expansion.
2.  The scheme's primary objective is to provide artisans and craftspeople with access to advanced technology and automation tools to enhance productivity.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The PM Vishwakarma Scheme is targeted at traditional artisans and craftspeople working in the *unorganized* sector, not the organized sector.  The financial assistance is primarily in the form of collateral-free loans, not substantial grants.  The scheme's focus is on skill upgradation and market linkages, not necessarily on providing advanced technology and automation tools, although digitalization is a component. The emphasis is on preserving traditional skills while improving their marketability and economic prospects.  The scheme aims to empower these artisans through skill enhancement, brand promotion, and access to credit, fostering sustainable livelihoods within their traditional crafts.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the PM Vishwakarma Scheme:**

1.  The scheme is implemented solely by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), excluding any involvement from other ministries.
2. The scheme offers a one-time, lump-sum grant of ₹5 lakh to each eligible artisan for business development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are inaccurate. The PM Vishwakarma Scheme is a joint initiative involving the Ministries of MSME, Skill Development, and Finance, demonstrating a multi-pronged approach to support traditional artisans. The financial assistance provided under the scheme is not a one-time grant but consists of collateral-free loans up to ₹3 lakh, disbursed in two tranches, coupled with a toolkit incentive. This structured approach aims for sustainable growth, not a one-off injection of capital. The collaborative implementation highlights the government's commitment to a holistic approach to artisan empowerment.


**3. With reference to the PM Vishwakarma Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme covers only eighteen traditional trades, with no provision for expansion to include other traditional crafts in the future.
2.  Eligibility for the scheme is restricted to artisans who have previously received government loans for business development.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. While the scheme initially focused on eighteen traditional trades, there's a possibility of expansion to encompass other traditional crafts in the future.  The scheme specifically *excludes* artisans who have received similar government loans within the past five years (with exceptions for fully repaid MUDRA and SVANidhi loans), aiming to provide support to those who haven't previously benefited from such schemes. This targeted approach ensures that the benefits reach a wider range of deserving artisans and craftspeople who need support to enhance their skills and market reach.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Food Import Rejection Alert (FIRA):**

1. FIRA is exclusively used by the FSSAI to notify food exporters about rejected consignments, thereby streamlining communication channels.
2.  The FIRA system is designed to enhance food safety by providing a real-time tracking mechanism for all stakeholders involved in the import process.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FIRA is designed to notify *importers*, not exporters, about rejected food consignments.  Statement 2 is correct. FIRA aims to strengthen risk management by providing an online platform for tracking rejected consignments, improving transparency and accountability for all stakeholders, including importers, customs officials, and FSSAI.  This real-time tracking mechanism enhances efficiency and facilitates prompt corrective actions to prevent unsafe food products from entering the market.  The system's comprehensive tracking capabilities contribute significantly to the overall effectiveness of India's food safety regulations.


**5. With reference to the Nagar Van Yojana (NVY), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NVY was launched in 2010 with the primary goal of creating green spaces in metropolitan areas to combat pollution.
2.  The scheme prioritizes the development of Nagar Vans in tier-2 and tier-3 cities based on their population density and green cover.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The Nagar Van Yojana (NVY) was launched in 2020, not 2010. The scheme's focus is on creating urban forests (Nagar Vans) in *urban areas* to improve the environment, not solely in metropolitan areas.  The selection of cities for the project is not strictly based on tier classification, population density, or existing green cover, but rather on the availability of suitable land for the development of urban forests.  The scheme aims to enhance green cover in urban areas, regardless of city size, to improve air quality and overall environmental conditions.


**6. Consider the following statements with reference to the National Supercomputing Mission:**

1.  The National Supercomputing Mission was launched in 2010 by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to improve India's technological capabilities.
2. The mission primarily targets the needs of large multinational corporations and private sector entities, providing them with access to high-performance computing resources.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The National Supercomputing Mission was launched in 2015, jointly by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and MeitY, not solely by MeitY in 2010. The mission's objective is to enhance India's supercomputing infrastructure for a broad range of users, including academia, researchers, MSMEs, and startups, not exclusively large multinational corporations and private sector entities.  The mission aims to democratize access to high-performance computing resources, fostering innovation and research across diverse sectors within the Indian economy.


**7. With reference to the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), consider the following statements:**

1. ABDM exclusively focuses on digitizing records within public healthcare facilities, excluding private healthcare providers.
2.  The mission aims to create a centralized database of all citizens' medical information, accessible to any authorized healthcare professional.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. ABDM's goal is to create a national digital health ecosystem, encompassing both public and *private* healthcare facilities. It promotes interoperability and data sharing to improve healthcare access and quality. While the mission facilitates the creation of a Health ID for every citizen to store medical records, it doesn't aim for a completely centralized, universally accessible database.  Data privacy and security are central concerns, and access is controlled through appropriate authorization mechanisms. The ABDM aims to create a more efficient and interconnected healthcare system, respecting individual privacy while improving healthcare delivery.


**8. Which of the following clearances can be obtained using the PARIVESH Portal?**

1.  Environmental Clearance (EC)
2.  Forest Clearance (FC)
3.  Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance
4.  Wildlife (WL) clearance

**Select the correct answer using the code given below:**
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PARIVESH portal is a single-window system for environmental clearances in India.  It aims to streamline the process of obtaining various environmental and related clearances. All four clearances mentioned – Environmental Clearance (EC), Forest Clearance (FC), Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance, and Wildlife (WL) clearance – can be obtained through the PARIVESH portal.  This integrated platform reduces bureaucratic hurdles, improving efficiency and transparency in the environmental regulatory process. The consolidation of these clearances under one platform reduces the time and effort required for project proponents seeking environmental approvals.

**1. With reference to the Samagra Shiksha scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  Samagra Shiksha subsumes the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), but excludes the Teacher Education (TE) scheme.
2.  The scheme's primary objective is to support state and UT implementations of the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) and the Right to Education Act, 2009, with a secondary focus on early childhood care and foundational literacy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that Samagra Shiksha *does* subsume the Teacher Education (TE) scheme along with SSA and RMSA.  The question attempts to mislead by omitting this crucial detail.  The Samagra Shiksha scheme is designed to be a comprehensive program covering all aspects of school education, including teacher training.

Statement 2 is largely correct. While the scheme does support the implementation of NEP 2020 and the RTE Act, 2009,  the phrasing "primary objective" is slightly nuanced.  The objectives are multifaceted, encompassing foundational literacy and numeracy, early childhood care, and support for state-level implementations.  However, the emphasis on NEP 2020 and RTE Act implementation is significant, making statement 2 closer to the truth than statement 1.  The question tries to create doubt by highlighting the "secondary focus" while downplaying the importance of NEP 2020 and RTE Act implementation.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the legal framework underpinning education in India:**

1. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, mandates pre-school education as a fundamental right, directly derived from Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.
2.  State Implementation Societies (SIS) are primarily responsible for implementing the recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) at the state level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RTE Act, 2009, does mandate free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14, it does not mandate pre-school education.  Pre-school education is encouraged under the act, but not legally required in the same way as primary education. The question attempts to confuse by linking pre-school education directly to the RTE Act and incorrectly citing Article 21 instead of Article 21A, which forms the basis of the RTE Act.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While SIS plays a crucial role in state-level implementation of various education schemes, including those aligned with NEP 2020,  attributing primary responsibility solely to them is an oversimplification.  Multiple agencies and stakeholders at various levels are involved in the implementation of NEP 2020, including the central government, state governments, and local bodies. The question creates a misleading impression by isolating the SIS and overstating their role in NEP 2020 implementation.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar (PMRBP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMRBP awards are presented annually to children aged between 6 and 18 years for exceptional achievements in six categories, including bravery, art & culture, and social service.
2.  Each PMRBP awardee receives a medal, a certificate, and a monetary reward of ₹1 lakh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The age range is slightly off; the awards are given to children aged 5-18 years.  Also, there are seven, not six, award categories. However, the core information about the nature of the award and its categories is accurate enough for the statement to be considered correct in the context of a multiple-choice question. The question tries to mislead through minor inaccuracies in the details.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clarifies that each awardee receives a medal, certificate, and a citation booklet. There is no mention of a monetary reward. This is a significant factual inaccuracy designed to act as a distractor.  The question plays on the possibility that the examinee might assume such a prestigious award would include a significant financial component.


**4. With reference to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMD, established in 1875 under the British Raj, is currently under the Ministry of Earth Sciences and is a member of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
2.  The IMD's SAFAR system is primarily used for monitoring and forecasting thunderstorms and measuring maximum sustained wind speeds, utilizing the Long Period Average (LPA) as a key benchmark.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text confirms the IMD's establishment date, its current affiliation with the Ministry of Earth Sciences, and its membership in the WMO.  The question makes no attempt to distort this information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the IMD does monitor and forecast thunderstorms and measure maximum sustained wind speeds, the SAFAR system's primary function is air quality monitoring.  The LPA is used in weather forecasting, but not specifically by the SAFAR system.  The question creates confusion by incorrectly associating SAFAR with thunderstorm monitoring and wind speed measurement, and by misrepresenting the primary use of the LPA.  The statement attempts to link related but distinct concepts to mislead.


**5. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-KMY is a voluntary contributory pension scheme for small and marginal farmers aged between 18 and 40 years, providing a monthly pension of ₹3,000 after they turn 60, with the central government contributing an equal amount to the pension fund as the farmer.
2.  As of the latest available data, Bihar has the highest number of registrations under PM-KMY, followed by Jharkhand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description accurately reflects the key features of PM-KMY: its voluntary and contributory nature, the age eligibility, the pension amount, and the government's matching contribution.  The question does not attempt to misrepresent the scheme's core features.

Statement 2 is also correct. The provided text supports this claim, indicating Bihar's leading position in PM-KMY registrations followed by Jharkhand. The question uses a straightforward and factual statement to act as a less deceptive distractor.  The fact about Bihar and Jharkhand's relative registrations is less likely to be known by the average examinee, making it a good choice for a less obvious correct statement.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMSY primarily aims to enhance fish production through infrastructure development and technological advancements in the aquaculture sector.
2. The Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) is a sub-scheme entirely independent of PMMSY, operating under a different set of guidelines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PMMSY's core objective is to significantly improve fish production in India.  This is achieved through a multi-pronged approach encompassing infrastructure development (like cold storage, processing units), technology upgradation (improved farming techniques, disease management), and capacity building (training for fish farmers).  The scheme aims to boost the entire fisheries sector, contributing to the national economy and food security.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FIDF is *not* entirely independent but is, in fact, subsumed under PMMSY.  It acts as a crucial funding mechanism within the larger PMMSY framework, providing financial support for infrastructure development projects related to fisheries and aquaculture.  Therefore, FIDF's operations are directly linked to and guided by the overall goals of PMMSY. The distinction is that FIDF focuses specifically on infrastructure funding while PMMSY has a broader scope.  This makes the statement factually incorrect.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the PM Vishwakarma Scheme:**

1. The scheme exclusively benefits traditional artisans and craftspeople residing in rural areas, excluding those in urban settings.
2.  The scheme provides a toolkit incentive of up to ₹25,000 to each beneficiary, disbursed in a single installment upon enrollment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM Vishwakarma Scheme is designed to benefit traditional artisans and craftspeople in *both* rural and urban areas. The scheme's coverage explicitly includes both settings, aiming for comprehensive support across geographical locations.  The phased saturation of districts indicates an intention to reach artisans everywhere.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The toolkit incentive provided under the scheme is capped at ₹15,000, not ₹25,000.  Furthermore, this incentive is disbursed in the form of e-vouchers at the beginning of the basic skill training, not as a single lump sum upon enrollment.  The amount and the timing of the disbursement are both misrepresented in the statement.


**3. With reference to the Nagar Van Yojana (NVY), consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme mandates a minimum area of 25 hectares for each Nagar Van, aiming for substantial green cover in urban areas.
2.  NVY primarily involves government agencies in the creation and maintenance of urban forests, with minimal community participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While NVY aims for significant green cover, the minimum area required for a Nagar Van is 10 hectares, not 25 hectares. The upper limit is 50 hectares, demonstrating flexibility in project scale depending on the urban area's needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  NVY explicitly promotes community participation in the creation and maintenance of urban forests. The scheme actively encourages involvement from local communities, NGOs, educational institutions, and local bodies, recognizing the importance of shared responsibility and local knowledge in successful urban forestry initiatives.  The involvement of government agencies is a supporting role to this community-led effort.


**4. With reference to the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NSM, launched in 2010, is solely overseen by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
2. The primary aim of the mission is to enhance India's supercomputing infrastructure for use by academia, researchers, and MSMEs only, excluding startups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NSM was launched in 2015, not 2010, and is jointly steered by both the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and MeitY, reflecting a collaborative approach to developing India's supercomputing capabilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While academia, researchers, and MSMEs are key beneficiaries of the enhanced supercomputing infrastructure under NSM, the mission's scope explicitly includes startups as well.  The increasing demand for supercomputing resources across various sectors necessitates a broad reach, which the NSM addresses by supporting these diverse user groups.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM):**

1. The ABDM exclusively focuses on improving the digital health infrastructure within public healthcare facilities, leaving private providers outside its purview.
2. Under the ABDM, every citizen is assigned a unique Health ID, which serves as a centralized repository for all medical information, including sensitive details like genetic data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ABDM's aim is to create a *unified* digital health ecosystem encompassing both public and private healthcare providers.  Integration across sectors is crucial for achieving universal health coverage and streamlined healthcare access, making the statement incorrect.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.  A mutation in the hemoglobin gene leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), causing red blood cells to become rigid, sticky, and sickle-shaped. This altered shape impairs their ability to carry oxygen effectively and can lead to blockages in blood vessels.  The primary consequence is the dysfunction of red blood cells, not other cell types.

Statement 2 is also correct. Gene therapy represents a promising approach to treating sickle cell anemia. One strategy involves harvesting the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the cells that give rise to all blood cells.  These HSCs are then modified in a laboratory setting to correct the faulty hemoglobin gene using gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 or viral vectors. The corrected HSCs are then transplanted back into the patient, where they can produce healthy red blood cells, potentially offering a long-term cure.  While bone marrow transplant is another curative option, gene therapy offers a less invasive alternative.  The statement accurately reflects gene therapy's role as a potential cure, focusing on the use of the patient's own cells.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, despite being farther from the Sun than Mercury. This is because Venus has a very dense atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide, which traps heat through a runaway greenhouse effect.  Mercury, in contrast, has an extremely thin exosphere, providing minimal insulation against the Sun's heat and allowing much of it to radiate back into space.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.  It is not similar to Earth's atmosphere, which is primarily nitrogen and oxygen, and it is considerably less dense. The composition reflects the processes that shaped Mercury's surface and its interaction with the solar wind.

2.  India primarily imports phosphoric acid from countries in North Africa and the Middle East, as it is a key ingredient in diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is a *weak* acid, not a strong acid.  While it is crucial in fertilizer production, it is not used to produce urea. Urea is primarily produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide.  DAP (diammonium phosphate), on the other hand, does use phosphoric acid in its manufacturing.  Urea is the most consumed fertilizer in India, but DAP is the second most consumed.

Statement 2 is correct. India is a significant importer of phosphoric acid, primarily sourcing it from countries like Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, and Tunisia (North Africa and the Middle East). This is because phosphoric acid is a key component in the production of DAP fertilizer, a vital input for Indian agriculture.  The domestic production of phosphoric acid doesn't meet the country's agricultural needs.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding  modulation in communication systems:**

**1. With reference to the geographical features of Peninsular India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadris, are a part of the Peninsular Plateau and converge with the Eastern Ghats.
2.  The rain shadow effect of the Western Ghats significantly impacts rainfall patterns in the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, leading to less easily erodible soil in these areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats, a significant geographical feature of peninsular India, are indeed part of the Peninsular Plateau.  They are also known as the Sahyadris and, while not directly "converging" in the sense of a physical joining, they do meet the Eastern Ghats at their southernmost extent, forming a roughly horseshoe-shaped mountain range around the Deccan Plateau. The geological history and formation of both ranges contribute to the overall topography of the peninsula.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Western Ghats act as a major rain shadow barrier.  The orographic rainfall caused by the southwest monsoon hitting the Western Ghats leads to abundant rainfall on the western side, while the leeward side (east coast) experiences a rain shadow effect, resulting in significantly less rainfall in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. This rain shadow effect influences soil formation; the drier conditions on the eastern side result in different soil types compared to the wetter western slopes. While the exact erodibility might vary depending on other factors, the reduced rainfall in the rain shadow region generally leads to less easily erodible soils than those on the windward side.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats influence wind patterns across Peninsular India, contributing to the formation of a water divide.
2. The Periyar River, originating in the Western Ghats, exhibits rapid flow due to the steep gradient characterizing parts of the mountain range.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats' significant elevation creates a barrier effect on wind patterns across Peninsular India. The mountains disrupt the unimpeded flow of the monsoon winds, causing them to rise and cool, resulting in orographic rainfall. This also creates a significant water divide, separating the river systems flowing towards the Arabian Sea from those flowing into the Bay of Bengal. The Western Ghats' role in shaping the hydrological patterns of peninsular India is a crucial aspect of its geographical significance.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Western Ghats are characterized by a steep gradient in many sections, particularly where they rise abruptly from the coastal plains. This steep slope leads to rapid water flow in rivers originating in these regions.  The Periyar River, one such river, experiences a fast flow due to this steep gradient. The steepness of the terrain also contributes to other geographical processes such as landslides and soil erosion.


**3. With reference to the Western Ghats Expert Ecology Panel (WGEEP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WGEEP, also known as the Gadgil Committee, was responsible for studying the Western Ghats and recommending measures for its ecologically sensitive areas.
2. The Kasturirangan Committee provided recommendations for the management and conservation of the Western Ghats, with a focus on designating ecologically sensitive zones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats' varied topography and rainfall patterns lead to a diverse range of biomes.  Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests are found in areas with high rainfall, while Sub-tropical Moist Pine Forests occur at higher altitudes with specific climatic conditions. Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests, however, are typically found in regions with a distinct dry season and less overall rainfall, which is not prevalent across most of the Western Ghats.


Statement 2 is also correct.  The Western Ghats are indeed a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognized for their exceptional biodiversity and ecological significance. The region's high rainfall, primarily from the southwest monsoon, supports lush vegetation and the steep gradients contribute to the fast-flowing rivers.  The high rainfall and fertile soils created by the mountains' influence are directly related to the success of economic activities such as coffee production in the region.  The region's unique environment also supports other economic activities like spice cultivation and timber extraction, although these often present conservation challenges.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Western Ghats:**

1. The Western Ghats are located in Peninsular India and are susceptible to landslides due to their steep slopes and high rainfall.
2.  The city of Mumbai is situated within the rain shadow region of the Western Ghats, experiencing lower rainfall compared to the western slopes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats form a continuous mountain range along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau in peninsular India. Their steep slopes and high rainfall create a high-risk environment for landslides.  The combination of heavy rainfall and unstable geology makes the Western Ghats particularly vulnerable to landslides, especially during monsoon seasons.  This poses significant challenges to infrastructure development and human settlements in the region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mumbai is located on the western coast of India, on the windward side of the Western Ghats.  Therefore, it receives the full impact of the monsoon winds and experiences relatively high rainfall, unlike areas in the rain shadow region located to the east of the mountains.  The city's location on the coast and its exposure to the Arabian Sea also influence its rainfall pattern.


**6. With reference to the Eastern and Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Malabar Coast is located on the western side (windward side) of the Western Ghats, facing the Arabian Sea.  It receives abundant rainfall from the southwest monsoon, and therefore, it does not experience a rain shadow effect. The rain shadow effect is characteristic of the eastern side of the Western Ghats.

Statement 2 is correct.  Sugarcane cultivation requires specific climatic conditions, including adequate sunlight and warmth, along with sufficient water. While the Western Ghats receive high rainfall, especially on the western slopes, the high humidity and cloud cover in certain areas may not be ideal for sugarcane growth.  The steep slopes and challenging terrain also make large-scale sugarcane cultivation impractical in many parts of the Western Ghats.  Therefore, sugarcane cultivation is more commonly found in the plains and less mountainous areas of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Assam Cascade Frog is indeed endemic to the Himalayan regions of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. However, it is *not* found exclusively in the plains of northern India.  This species is associated with fast-flowing streams and waterfalls in mountainous areas and prefers hilly or mountainous habitats within its range.  Its habitat is very specific and is limited to these areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Assam Cascade Frog is indeed considered an indicator species, meaning its presence or absence, and population size, reflect the health and quality of its habitat.  Changes in water quality, pollution, or habitat destruction can have a significant impact on its population. While precise population decline figures may vary depending on the specific studies and the timeframe considered, it is true that the frog's population has experienced declines in recent years, primarily due to habitat loss and degradation.  The species' sensitivity to environmental change makes it a valuable indicator of the ecosystem's overall condition.


**8. With reference to the Commons, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commons refers to resources owned by individuals or groups and are shared by the community.
2. Language, folk art, local customs, and traditional knowledge are examples of the Commons, and there are currently several international agreements governing the access to and use of these resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The concept of "the Commons" refers to resources that are not privately owned by individuals or groups, but rather are shared by a community as a whole.  These resources may or may not be managed by the government, but the key element is their collective ownership and shared use.  Examples include common grazing lands, forests, water bodies, etc.

Statement 2 is partially correct in its first part. Intangible resources like language, folk art, local customs, and traditional knowledge are also increasingly recognized as part of the Commons.  However, the second part of the statement is incorrect. While there's growing awareness of the need for international agreements to govern access to and use of these intangible commons, protecting traditional knowledge from biopiracy for instance, the existence of *several* robust international agreements specifically addressing all of these intangible resources is not entirely accurate at present.  Negotiations and frameworks exist, but a comprehensive and fully implemented global system is still under development.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The IUCN Red List categorizes species as "Critically Endangered" if their population has declined by more than 80% over the last 10 years.
2.  A population size of less than 100 mature individuals is a criterion for classifying a species as "Critically Endangered" according to the IUCN Red List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IUCN Red List uses a more stringent criterion for "Critically Endangered" status. While a significant population decline is a factor, the threshold is actually a reduction of more than 90% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer.  The statement incorrectly lowers this threshold to 80%.  The IUCN considers multiple factors, not solely population reduction, for classification.

Statement 2 is partially correct but imprecise.  A population size of less than 50 mature individuals is one of the criteria used by the IUCN to classify a species as Critically Endangered. The statement incorrectly increases this threshold to 100.  The IUCN also considers other factors, including the rate of population decline and the extent of geographic range, in determining the Critically Endangered classification. The number 50 is a key threshold, not 100, making the statement incorrect. Therefore, only statement 2 reflects a correct, albeit imprecise, aspect of the IUCN Red List criteria.

1.  The GII methodology primarily focuses on measuring a nation's capacity for technological innovation, excluding factors like institutional quality or human capital.
2.  The GII rankings consistently place developed nations at the top, with little variation in the top 10 positions across different years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII's methodology is far more comprehensive than just technological innovation. It incorporates a wide range of factors influencing innovation, including institutional quality, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, business sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, and creative outputs.  The index considers a nation's overall capacity for innovation, not solely its technological prowess.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While developed nations frequently dominate the top ranks of the GII, there is considerable fluctuation within the top 10 positions from year to year.  Emerging economies often demonstrate significant improvement, leading to changes in their relative rankings. The GII reflects dynamic shifts in innovation capabilities globally.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO):**

1.  WIPO's primary function is to regulate international trade in intellectual property, setting tariffs and quotas for various IP-related goods and services.
2.  The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge is a significant agreement facilitated by WIPO that aims to protect traditional knowledge from exploitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  WIPO's role is not to directly regulate international trade in intellectual property in terms of setting tariffs and quotas.  Its main function is to foster international cooperation for the protection of intellectual property rights. This involves developing international treaties, providing technical assistance, and offering dispute resolution services. Trade aspects are handled by other international organizations like the WTO.

Statement 2 is correct. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge is a significant WIPO initiative aimed at addressing the challenges of protecting traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources.  This treaty seeks to ensure that indigenous and local communities benefit from the use of their traditional knowledge, preventing its unauthorized exploitation.


**3. With reference to the World Economic Forum (WEF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The WEF's annual meeting in Davos is solely focused on discussions regarding global economic policies, excluding social and environmental issues.
2.  The WEF's Global Gender Gap Report provides a comprehensive ranking of countries based on gender equality across various sectors, including economic participation, educational attainment, and political empowerment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WEF's annual meeting in Davos is a multi-faceted event addressing a wide range of global issues, including economic policies, social issues, environmental concerns, technological advancements, and geopolitical challenges. It is not solely focused on economics.

Statement 2 is correct. The WEF's Global Gender Gap Report is a well-recognized publication that provides a comprehensive assessment of gender equality across various dimensions.  It ranks countries based on their progress toward closing the gender gap in economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.


**4. With reference to Euthanasia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Passive euthanasia, while legal in some jurisdictions, is universally accepted as morally and ethically sound across all cultures and belief systems.
2.  Active euthanasia, involving the deliberate act of ending a person's life, is legally permissible in most developed nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The legality and ethical acceptance of passive euthanasia are highly debated and vary significantly across different jurisdictions and cultures. While some countries have legalized it under specific circumstances,  many others still consider it illegal or morally objectionable.  There is no universal consensus regarding its ethical implications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Active euthanasia remains illegal in a significant number of countries, even many developed nations.  Legal frameworks regarding end-of-life care vary widely, reflecting diverse cultural, ethical, and religious perspectives.  The legal permissibility of active euthanasia is far from universal.


**5. With reference to the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's advisory jurisdiction, as outlined in Article 143 of the Constitution, allows it to provide non-binding opinions on matters referred to it by the President.
2. The Supreme Court has unlimited original jurisdiction over all disputes arising within the territory of India, irrespective of the nature of the dispute.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 143 of the Indian Constitution grants the Supreme Court advisory jurisdiction.  The President can seek the Court's opinion on any question of law or fact of public importance. However, these opinions are advisory and not binding on the President or the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is not unlimited.  While it has original jurisdiction in specific matters outlined in the Constitution (e.g., disputes between the Union and States, disputes between the Union and one or more States), it does not have original jurisdiction over all disputes within India.  Many disputes fall under the purview of other courts and tribunals.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Santhanam Committee:**

1. The Santhanam Committee's recommendations primarily focused on reforming the Indian banking sector, addressing issues of corruption and inefficiency within financial institutions.
2. The committee's report led directly to the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhanam Committee, appointed in 1962, primarily focused on the prevention of corruption in public life, not banking sector reforms.  While its recommendations touched upon various aspects of governance, its core mandate was to address systemic corruption within the government machinery.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Santhanam Committee's report significantly influenced anti-corruption efforts, it did not directly lead to the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.  The 1988 Act was a culmination of various legislative and administrative actions taken over several years, influenced by several reports and committees, not solely the Santhanam Committee's report.  The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 built upon existing legislation  and incorporated recommendations from multiple sources.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) directly investigates all corruption cases within the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF).
2. The CVC's establishment was a direct consequence of the findings of the Santhanam Committee report on the Prevention of Corruption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CVC oversees and ensures the proper functioning of various government departments, including those related to internal security like the Ministry of Home Affairs which oversees the CAPF,  the CVC does not directly investigate *all* corruption cases within the CAPFs.  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) often handles such investigations,  and the CVC's role is primarily supervisory and coordinating. The CVC investigates allegations of corruption and malpractices against public servants but it does not have the sole authority to investigate all cases across all organizations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption, established by the Government of India, recommended setting up the CVC to enhance integrity, transparency, and accountability in the public sector.  The CVC's establishment in 1964 was a direct response to this recommendation.  Therefore, the CVC's existence is fundamentally linked to the Santhanam Committee's work.  The committee's report highlighted systemic issues and the need for a central body to address corruption effectively.


**2. With reference to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CVC's mandate includes advising the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on matters of integrity and recruitment processes.
2. The Lokpal, an anti-corruption ombudsman, operates independently of the CVC and has no formal reporting relationship with it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CVC's role is primarily focused on preventing corruption within the government's executive branch. While the CVC promotes integrity across the public sector, it doesn't directly advise the UPSC on recruitment processes. The UPSC is an independent constitutional body responsible for recruitment to civil services.  The CVC's influence on UPSC's actions is indirect, through its overall impact on maintaining ethical standards in government.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lokpal and the CVC are distinct anti-corruption bodies in India. The Lokpal investigates corruption allegations against high-ranking officials, including ministers, while the CVC focuses on public servants in the executive branch. They operate independently, and there is no formal reporting structure linking the two.  Although both aim to curb corruption, their jurisdictions and operational mechanisms are separate.


**3. With reference to the powers and functions of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CVC has the authority to initiate criminal prosecutions against individuals found guilty of corruption.
2. A specific Act of Parliament explicitly designates the CVC as the ultimate authority for investigating corruption cases within all government organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CVC's power is primarily investigative and recommendatory. It doesn't possess the authority to directly initiate criminal prosecutions.  The CVC investigates allegations of corruption and submits its findings and recommendations to the appropriate authorities, who then decide on further action, including potential criminal prosecution.  The investigative agencies like the CBI typically handle the prosecution aspect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While an Act of Parliament (Resolution in 1964) established the CVC and defines its functions, it doesn't explicitly grant the CVC the sole authority to investigate all corruption cases across all government bodies.  The CVC's jurisdiction is broad, but other agencies, such as the CBI and State Vigilance Commissions, also handle corruption investigations.  The CVC's role often involves coordination and oversight of these investigations.


**4. With reference to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI is required by law to report all its findings directly to the CVC on every corruption investigation it undertakes.
2. The Santhanam Committee's recommendations directly influenced the establishment of both the CVC and the CBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CVC and the CBI collaborate closely on anti-corruption efforts, the CBI is not legally obligated to report all its findings directly to the CVC on every investigation.  The CBI reports to the government, and the CVC's role is primarily supervisory and coordinating.  The CVC can review the CBI's investigations but doesn't have direct control over their reporting structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Santhanam Committee's recommendations were instrumental in the establishment of the CVC. Although the CBI existed before the Santhanam Committee, its mandate and role in anti-corruption efforts were significantly shaped by the committee's findings and recommendations. The committee’s recommendations focused on strengthening existing anti-corruption mechanisms and establishing new ones, impacting both the CVC and CBI's roles.


**5.  Which of the following bodies played a crucial role in recommending the establishment of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)?**

(a) The Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC)
(b) The Second Administrative Reforms Commission (SARC)
(c) The Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption
(d) The Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Santhanam Committee, established in 1962 to inquire into the prevalence of corruption, specifically recommended the creation of the CVC. The ARC and SARC addressed broader administrative reforms, while the Sarkaria Commission dealt with Centre-State relations, none of these had a direct role in recommending the CVC's formation. The Santhanam Committee's report, which highlighted the widespread nature of corruption and the weaknesses in existing mechanisms for addressing it, provided the impetus for the creation of the CVC. The committee's detailed analysis and recommendations provided the blueprint for the CVC's structure and function.


**6.  With reference to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and State Vigilance Commissions, consider the following statements:**

1. State Vigilance Commissions are directly subordinate to the CVC and report to it regularly on their activities.
2. The CVC has the authority to issue directives to State Vigilance Commissions concerning their investigations and procedures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CVC coordinates anti-corruption efforts across the country and provides guidance, State Vigilance Commissions are constitutionally independent bodies within their respective states. They are not directly subordinate to the CVC and do not have a formal reporting hierarchy to it.  They function autonomously within their state's legal and administrative framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CVC does not possess the authority to directly issue directives to State Vigilance Commissions. The CVC's role is primarily advisory and coordinating.  Its influence on State Vigilance Commissions is indirect, through its recommendations, guidelines, and overall leadership in the fight against corruption.  State Vigilance Commissions maintain their autonomy in their investigative processes and procedures.  The relationship between the CVC and State Vigilance Commissions is one of cooperation and coordination, not direct control.


**7. With reference to the role of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) in preventing corruption, consider the following statements:**

1. The CVC can directly impose penalties and punishments on public servants found guilty of corruption.
2. The CVC's primary role is to investigate corruption cases and prosecute those involved.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CVC is not an enforcement agency. It doesn't have the authority to impose penalties or punishments. Its role is investigative and recommendatory. The CVC investigates allegations of corruption and makes recommendations to the relevant authorities, who then take appropriate action, including disciplinary measures or criminal prosecution. The CVC's recommendations carry significant weight, but the final decision-making power rests with other agencies and bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CVC does investigate corruption cases, its primary role isn't to prosecute.  The CVC's main focus is on prevention, detection, and recommending appropriate action.  Prosecution of those involved is typically undertaken by investigative agencies like the CBI or other law enforcement bodies, based on the CVC's findings and recommendations. The CVC's proactive role in prevention, through guidelines and monitoring, is a crucial aspect of its function to make the system more robust against corruption.

**1. With reference to Sachchidananda Sinha's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  He played a pivotal role in the formation of the separate province of Bihar and Orissa, advocating for its distinct administrative identity.
2.  His key writings primarily focused on the socio-political dynamics of the Bengal Presidency, offering detailed analyses of its unique challenges and opportunities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Sachchidananda Sinha was instrumental in the creation of the separate province of Bihar and Orissa.  His political acumen and persistent efforts within the Indian National Congress and the British administration were crucial in achieving this administrative separation, recognizing the distinct needs and characteristics of the region.  He understood the need for a separate administrative structure to address the regional specificities and accelerate development in Bihar and Orissa.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Sinha's writings undoubtedly touched upon the Bengal Presidency given his origins there, his major works extended far beyond a singular focus on Bengal. His key writings, such as "Iqbal: The Poet and His Message" and "Kashmir the Playground of Asia," demonstrate a broader scope of intellectual interests and engagement with wider Indian socio-political issues.  His contributions to constitutional nationalism and his role in the Constituent Assembly further highlight his national, rather than regional, focus.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Swami Sahajanand Saraswati's activism:**

1.  He led the Bakasht movement primarily in the Punjab region, focusing on reclaiming land for tenant farmers unjustly evicted by wealthy landowners.
2.  His involvement in the Dalmia sugar mill struggle in Bihar showcased his commitment to inter-caste unity, bringing together diverse groups of workers and farmers under a common cause.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Swami Sahajanand Saraswati's Bakasht movement did indeed focus on securing land rights for tenant farmers, it primarily operated in Bihar, not Punjab. His efforts in Bihar directly led to legislative changes aimed at protecting farmers' rights and interests.  The geographical location of his main activism is a crucial aspect of understanding his impact.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Dalmia sugar mill struggle in Bihar is a prime example of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati's success in fostering peasant-worker unity. This highlights his broader approach to social and economic justice, transcending caste and class divisions to build a powerful coalition for workers' rights.  His leadership in this specific case demonstrates a focus on inclusive and collaborative movements.


**3. With reference to Rukmini Lakshmipathi's contributions to the Indian freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1.  She played a significant role in the Non-Cooperation Movement, actively participating in boycotts and civil disobedience campaigns throughout Andhra Pradesh.
2.  Her participation in the Salt Satyagraha in Vedaranyam led to her becoming the first female prisoner in the movement, a significant symbolic victory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rukmini Lakshmipathi was a significant figure in the Indian freedom struggle and influenced by Gandhian ideals, her major contributions were centered around the Salt Satyagraha and her later political career in Madras Presidency, not the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Pinpointing her specific campaign involvement is crucial for accurate assessment.

Statement 2 is correct.  Rukmini Lakshmipathi's participation in the Salt Satyagraha at Vedaranyam is well-documented, and her imprisonment indeed marked a significant milestone, representing the growing participation of women in the movement and their willingness to face direct consequences for their actions.  Her arrest holds symbolic weight in the broader context of women's role in the struggle.


**4. With reference to Ashfaqulla Khan's revolutionary activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  He was a key figure in the Hindustan Republican Army (HRA), contributing significantly to its strategy and operational planning, particularly in the Kakori Conspiracy.
2.  His poetic works, published under various pseudonyms, often reflected his revolutionary ideals and served as a powerful form of political expression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ashfaqulla Khan was indeed a prominent member of the Hindustan Republican Association (later Hindustan Socialist Republican Association), playing a vital role in its armed revolutionary activities. His involvement in the Kakori Train Robbery, a significant event in the HRA's campaign, solidifies his position as a key figure in the organization's operations.

Statement 2 is also correct. Ashfaqulla Khan's poetic talents are well-documented, and he used his literary skills to express his revolutionary sentiments. His poems, published under pseudonyms such as Hasrat and Warsi, served as an important tool for disseminating his political message and inspiring fellow revolutionaries. His creative output is a significant aspect of his overall contribution.


**5. With reference to Malati Mem's role in Assam's freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1.  She was a key leader in the anti-British movement in the tea gardens of Assam, organizing workers and leading protests against exploitative labor practices.
2.  Her assassination in 1921 was directly linked to her outspoken opposition to the British opium trade in the region and her advocacy for the welfare of tea plantation workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Malati Mem (also known as Mangri Orang) was a prominent figure in the anti-colonial movement in Assam's tea gardens. She mobilized workers, led protests, and championed the cause of better working conditions and fair treatment for plantation laborers. Her leadership in this context is crucial to understanding the broader dynamics of the freedom struggle in Assam.

Statement 2 is also correct. Malati Mem's death in 1921 was a direct consequence of her activism against the British opium trade and her fight for the rights of tea garden workers.  Her assassination highlights the risks faced by those who challenged colonial authority and fought for social justice during this period.  Her death became a symbol of resistance and sacrifice.


**6. Consider the following statements about Shri Ramalinga Swamigal's contributions:**

1.  His teachings emphasized a strict adherence to traditional Hindu practices and rituals as a path to spiritual enlightenment.
2.  The Suddha Sanmarga Sangam, a key aspect of his philosophy, promoted the elimination of the caste system through a focus on love, charity, and divine practice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Shri Ramalinga Swamigal's teachings, while rooted in Hindu spirituality, did not emphasize a rigid adherence to traditional rituals.  His focus was on a more inclusive and egalitarian approach to spirituality, moving beyond caste-based distinctions and emphasizing inner transformation.  His philosophy was less concerned with outward displays of religious practice.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Suddha Sanmarga Sangam, established by Shri Ramalinga Swamigal, was indeed central to his efforts to dismantle the caste system.  His philosophy promoted love, charity, and divine practice as fundamental aspects of human life, advocating for a society based on equality and social harmony.  The Sangam's core principles actively challenged the discriminatory practices of the caste system.


**7. With reference to Raja Ravi Varma's artistic contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  He primarily focused on realistic portraiture, eschewing mythological and historical themes in favor of capturing the likeness of individuals.
2.  His pioneering use of lithography made his artwork accessible to a wider audience, significantly impacting the popularization of Indian art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Raja Ravi Varma did create portraits, a significant portion of his work depicted mythological and historical scenes from Indian epics and traditions.  His paintings brought these stories to life, making them visually accessible and popular.  His artistic style encompassed a broader range of subjects.

Statement 2 is correct. Raja Ravi Varma's innovative use of lithography was instrumental in disseminating his art to a much wider audience than would have been possible through traditional methods. This technological advancement made his paintings affordable and widely available, significantly impacting the popularization of Indian art and influencing subsequent generations of artists.  His contribution to the accessibility of art is noteworthy.


**8. With reference to the Ahilyabai Holkar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  She oversaw extensive infrastructure projects, including the construction of numerous temples and the development of Maheshwar into a significant center for textile production.
2.  Her rule was primarily characterized by military expansion, leading to significant territorial gains for the Holkar dynasty through successful campaigns against neighboring kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign was marked by significant infrastructural development. She undertook the construction and restoration of numerous temples across India, showcasing her devotion and patronage of religious institutions.  She also transformed Maheshwar into a thriving center for textile production, boosting the local economy and establishing its reputation for the famous Maheshwari saris.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar did maintain a strong military, her rule wasn't primarily focused on territorial expansion through aggressive campaigns.  Her focus was more on consolidating her existing power, promoting economic development, and supporting religious institutions, rather than engaging in extensive warfare.  Her governance priorities are distinct from a militaristic approach.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Ulgulan movement led by Birsa Munda:**

1.  The movement primarily focused on demanding greater autonomy for tribal communities within the existing colonial administrative structure.
2.  The movement's success led to the enactment of the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act in 1908, which aimed to protect tribal land rights from exploitation by non-tribal landowners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ulgulan movement, while advocating for tribal rights, wasn't primarily focused on achieving greater autonomy within the colonial system.  It was more of a large-scale rebellion against colonial rule and the exploitation of tribal communities.  The movement's goals were more radical than simply seeking administrative changes within the existing framework.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chotanagpur Tenancy Act of 1908, enacted after the Ulgulan movement, was a direct consequence of the struggles led by Birsa Munda and other tribal leaders.  The Act aimed to limit the transfer of tribal lands to non-tribal people, protecting tribal land ownership from encroachment and exploitation.  The Act was a significant, albeit delayed, response to the demands raised during the Ulgulan movement.


**10. With reference to the Alluri Sitarama Raju's Rampa Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rebellion was primarily triggered by the British government's introduction of new revenue systems that heavily burdened tribal communities.
2.  Alluri Sitarama Raju's knowledge of guerrilla warfare tactics and his ability to unite diverse tribal groups were key factors in the rebellion's initial success.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rampa Rebellion was significantly fueled by the British government's policies, including the Madras Forest Act of 1882, which restricted tribal access to forest resources and their traditional Podu cultivation system.  These policies directly impacted the livelihoods of tribal communities, leading to resentment and fueling the rebellion.

Statement 2 is also correct. Alluri Sitarama Raju's leadership was crucial to the rebellion's success.  His understanding of guerrilla warfare, his ability to mobilize and unite diverse tribal groups under a common cause, and his charismatic personality were all key factors in the rebellion's initial momentum.  His military strategies and leadership skills significantly contributed to the rebellion's impact.


**11.  With reference to Kazi Nazrul Islam's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  His early career involved serving in the British Indian Army, which provided him with insights into the realities of colonial rule that later informed his revolutionary writings.
2.  His literary works were consistently praised by the British colonial administration for their artistic merit, even while expressing nationalist sentiments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kazi Nazrul Islam's brief stint in the British Indian Army provided him with firsthand experience of the colonial system.  This experience significantly shaped his understanding of oppression and injustice, which he later powerfully articulated in his revolutionary poems, songs, and other writings.  His military service is a crucial aspect of his biographical background.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kazi Nazrul Islam's works, while recognized for their artistic merit, were often critical of British colonial rule and expressed strong nationalist sentiments.  This led to his works facing censorship and persecution by the colonial authorities, highlighting the tension between artistic expression and political dissent under colonial rule.  His rebellious nature and anti-colonial views led to conflict with the British administration.


**12. With reference to Srimanta Sankaradeva's legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. He primarily focused on reforming existing Hindu traditions, emphasizing the importance of ritualistic practices and temple worship.
2. His contributions extended beyond religious reform to include the development of unique Assamese art forms like Ankiya Naat and Sattriya dance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Srimanta Sankaradeva's teachings were rooted in Vaishnavism, he didn't focus on reforming existing Hindu traditions in a way that emphasized traditional ritualistic practices and temple worship.  His approach was more about establishing a new form of Vaishnavism (Ek-Sarana-Hari-Naam-Dharma) and promoting a distinct religious and cultural identity.

Statement 2 is correct. Srimanta Sankaradeva's influence extended far beyond religious reform. He played a crucial role in developing unique Assamese art forms, including Ankiya Naat (one-act plays), Borgeets (devotional songs), Bhaonas (dramatic performances), and Sattriya dance (a classical Indian dance form). His contributions enriched the cultural landscape of Assam.


**13.  Consider the following statements about Sree Narayana Guru's social reform movement:**

1. He primarily focused on uplifting the Ezhava community through educational initiatives and establishing organizations like the SNDP Yogam.
2. His movement actively promoted the idea of establishing separate religious and social institutions for the Ezhava community, advocating for a distinct identity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sree Narayana Guru's social reform efforts were largely concentrated on improving the social and educational conditions of the Ezhava community in Kerala.  He founded the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) to provide education and social upliftment to the community, advocating for equality and social justice.  His focus was on integration, not segregation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Sree Narayana Guru's movement did not advocate for the creation of separate religious and social institutions for the Ezhava community.  His core philosophy emphasized the idea of "One Caste, One Religion, One God," aiming for social integration and the eradication of caste discrimination. His approach was about inclusion within a broader society, not the creation of separate entities.


**14. With reference to Iqbal's key writings, consider the following statements:**

1.  His works primarily focused on advocating for the creation of a separate Muslim state in India, based on the concept of a distinct Muslim identity.
2.  His poetic and philosophical works explored themes of self-realization, spiritual awakening, and the importance of individual freedom and self-expression.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Iqbal's writings covered a wide range of topics, a significant aspect of his work was his advocacy for a separate Muslim state in India.  His vision was rooted in the concept of a distinct Muslim identity and culture, and he articulated this vision through his political writings and speeches, influencing the movement for the creation of Pakistan.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Iqbal's works are renowned for their exploration of deeper philosophical and spiritual themes.  His poetry and prose delved into issues of self-realization, spiritual awakening, and the importance of individual freedom and self-expression.  These themes are a significant part of his enduring legacy.  His philosophical depth is a crucial aspect of understanding his influence.


**15. With reference to the personalities mentioned in the provided text, consider the following statements:**

1.  All the individuals mentioned made significant contributions to India's freedom struggle through direct participation in major movements such as the Non-Cooperation Movement or the Civil Disobedience Movement.
2.  The contributions of these individuals were primarily limited to political activism, with little or no impact on social reform or cultural development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many of the individuals mentioned in the text contributed to India's freedom struggle, not all directly participated in major movements like the Non-Cooperation Movement or the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Some focused on regional movements or social reform, while others contributed through writing, education, or other forms of activism.  The range of their activities is diverse.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The contributions of these individuals extended far beyond political activism.  Many were involved in social reform movements, cultural development, educational initiatives, or religious reform, demonstrating a broad range of engagement with the challenges of their time.  Their impact is multi-faceted and transcends political activism alone.

**1. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's political philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi advocated for complete independence (Purna Swaraj) from the outset of his political career in India.
2.  His concept of Ramrajya emphasized a decentralized, village-based governance structure rooted in social justice and equality.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhi ultimately championed Purna Swaraj,  his initial focus was on securing greater autonomy and self-governance within the British Empire.  His approach evolved over time, culminating in the demand for complete independence. The initial phases of his activism, such as the Champaran Satyagraha, were not explicitly aimed at complete separation from British rule.  His early strategies focused on negotiating with the British for reforms.

Statement 2 is correct. Gandhi's vision of Ramrajya, as outlined in his writings, envisioned an ideal state characterized by decentralized governance, with village communities forming the basic administrative units.  This system was meant to be based on principles of self-sufficiency, social justice, and equality, emphasizing ethical conduct and non-violence at all levels of society.  It represented a departure from centralized, hierarchical models of governance.  The concept drew inspiration from ancient Indian ideals but was adapted to address contemporary social and political challenges.


**2. With reference to the Indian National Congress (INC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The INC initially focused solely on the demands of the Indian elite, neglecting the concerns of the peasantry and working class.
2.  The INC consistently maintained a unified and monolithic stance on all political issues throughout its history.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the early INC was predominantly comprised of and led by the urban middle class and elite, its agenda gradually expanded to encompass the concerns of broader sections of Indian society, particularly under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.  The inclusion of peasant and worker movements within the broader national struggle against British rule demonstrates this shift.  However, the extent to which the INC effectively represented the interests of these groups remains a subject of historical debate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The INC's history was marked by significant internal divisions and factionalism, particularly between the Moderates and Extremists in the early 20th century, and later, between those who favored Gandhi's non-violent approach and those who advocated for more radical or socialist strategies.  These internal conflicts shaped the INC's political trajectory and strategies. The party's stance on various issues evolved depending on the prevailing political climate and the dominant factions within the organization.


**3. With reference to Jyotiba Phule's social reform work, consider the following statements:**

1.  Phule primarily focused his reform efforts on the upliftment of the Shudra caste, neglecting other marginalized communities.
2.  His organization, the Satyashodhak Samaj, primarily advocated for religious conversion as a means of social upliftment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jyotiba Phule's social reform work extended beyond the Shudra caste to encompass the broader spectrum of marginalized communities, including those considered "untouchable."  His efforts were directed at dismantling the caste system as a whole, not just addressing the concerns of one particular caste group. His critique of Brahminical dominance and his advocacy for education and social justice for all castes reflects this broader vision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Phule, did not advocate for religious conversion as a primary means of social upliftment.  Instead, it focused on promoting rationalism, social justice, and education as tools to empower marginalized communities within the existing social structure. While Phule criticized aspects of Hinduism, he did not promote conversion to another religion as a solution to social problems.


**4. With reference to the Sikh Gurus, consider the following statements:**

1. Guru Hargobind Sahib is credited with establishing the tradition of the Kes (unshorn hair) among Sikhs.
2. Guru Gobind Singh is known for establishing Anandpur Sahib as a center of Sikh religious and political activity.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Guru Hargobind Sahib did adopt a more militaristic approach to Sikhism, the tradition of the Kes (unshorn hair) was already established before his time and is associated with the foundational beliefs of Sikhism itself.  It's a core tenet of the faith, not a development initiated by a particular Guru.

Statement 2 is correct. Guru Gobind Singh is indeed credited with establishing Anandpur Sahib as a significant center for Sikh religious and political life.  The city became a hub of Sikh activity, marking a period of consolidation and assertion of Sikh identity and political power.  The establishment of Anandpur Sahib is associated with Guru Gobind Singh's significant contributions to the growth and development of Sikhism.


**5. With reference to the Ramappa Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's construction utilizes the keystone technique, a prominent feature of medieval Indian temple architecture.
2. The temple is located in the state of Andhra Pradesh and is known for its intricate carvings and sculptures.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ramappa Temple is renowned for its innovative use of the corbel arch technique, not the keystone technique. The corbel arch, a unique architectural feature, allowed for the creation of large, unsupported spans within the temple's structure.  The keystone technique is a different architectural principle, typically used in arch construction, and isn't the defining feature of the Ramappa Temple's construction.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Ramappa Temple is indeed known for its intricate carvings and sculptures.  However, it's located in Telangana, not Andhra Pradesh.  This geographical detail is crucial and reflects the importance of understanding the specific location of significant historical and cultural sites.


**6. With reference to the women who participated in India's freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ammu Swaminathan was a prominent figure in the Salt Satyagraha of 1930, known for her active participation in the protests at Dandi.
2.  Rajkumari Amrit Kaur served as the first Health Minister of independent India and was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ammu Swaminathan was a significant figure in India's freedom struggle and played a vital role in the women's movement, her prominent involvement was not specifically in the Dandi March of the Salt Satyagraha.  Her contributions lay in other aspects of the nationalist movement and social reform.  Attributing her prominent role to a specific event like the Dandi March is factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  Rajkumari Amrit Kaur's contributions to India's freedom struggle are well-documented, and she did indeed serve as the first Health Minister of independent India.  Furthermore, her participation in the Constituent Assembly further underscores her importance in the nation's formative years.  Her involvement in both political and administrative spheres made her a significant figure in shaping post-independence India.


**7.  With reference to the Balfour Declaration, consider the following statements:**

1. The declaration explicitly guaranteed the creation of an independent Jewish state in Palestine.
2.  The declaration was primarily motivated by British strategic interests during World War I, aiming to secure support from Jewish communities globally.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Balfour Declaration did not explicitly guarantee the creation of an independent Jewish state in Palestine.  Instead, it expressed support for the establishment of a "national home" for the Jewish people in Palestine, leaving the specifics of its implementation open to interpretation.  This ambiguity later became a significant factor in the complex political dynamics of the region.

Statement 2 is correct. The Balfour Declaration was indeed influenced by British strategic interests during World War I.  The British government sought to garner support from Jewish communities in the United States and elsewhere, hoping to leverage their influence in the war effort.  This strategic calculation played a significant role in the phrasing and timing of the declaration.  The declaration's wording reflects this complex interplay between political expediency and the aspirations of the Zionist movement.


**8. With reference to the Munda Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The rebellion was primarily led by Birsa Munda and focused on the establishment of a separate tribal kingdom ("Munda Raj").
2. The British government responded to the rebellion by enacting the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act of 1908 to protect tribal land rights.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Birsa Munda was the central figure in leading the Munda Rebellion (also known as Ulgulan), and a key aim was indeed the establishment of a separate tribal kingdom, or "Munda Raj." This reflects the rebellion's goal of asserting tribal autonomy and challenging the dominance of non-tribal groups and the colonial administration.  The rebellion aimed to overthrow the existing power structures and establish an independent tribal state.

Statement 2 is correct. The British government did respond to the Munda Rebellion and the broader unrest among tribal populations by enacting the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act of 1908.  This act was intended to protect tribal land rights from encroachment by non-tribal groups.  It's considered a significant legislative response to the challenges posed by tribal movements and the need to address land-related issues in tribal areas.  However, the act's effectiveness in achieving its goals is a subject of ongoing discussion among historians.


**9. With reference to the Lodi Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lodi dynasty's rule was primarily confined to the Delhi region, with limited influence over other parts of India.
2. The dynasty's downfall was directly caused by the invasion of Timur (Tamerlane), marking the end of their rule in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Lodi dynasty did exert influence beyond Delhi, their primary power base and control were concentrated in the Delhi region.  Their control over other parts of India was less extensive compared to earlier dynasties like the Mughals. Their rule was largely confined to the northwestern parts of India, and their influence did not extend to the southern or eastern regions to the same degree as other empires.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lodi dynasty's downfall was not directly caused by Timur's invasion. Timur's invasion occurred much earlier, and the Lodi dynasty emerged after a period of political instability following Timur's campaigns.  The Lodi dynasty's fall was primarily due to Babur's invasion and the decisive Battle of Panipat in 1526.  This battle marked the end of the Lodi rule and the beginning of the Mughal Empire in India.  Timur's influence on the Lodi Dynasty's history is indirect and not the immediate cause of its downfall.


**10. With reference to the architectural features of the New Parliament House in Delhi, consider the following statements:**

1. The design of the building incorporates elements inspired by the Chausath Yogini Temple in Madhya Pradesh.
2. The Lok Sabha chamber is designed around the theme of the National Flower, the Lotus.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The design of the new Parliament House, while modern, draws inspiration from traditional Indian architectural styles and symbolism.  The circular design of the old Parliament House building is believed to have been inspired by the Chausath Yogini Temple in Madhya Pradesh. The new design reflects a conscious effort to blend modern functionality with elements of India's rich architectural heritage.  The use of traditional building materials from various parts of India also highlights this aspect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lok Sabha chamber is designed around the theme of the National Bird, the Peacock, not the National Flower, the Lotus. The Rajya Sabha chamber, on the other hand, uses the Lotus as its thematic design element.  This reflects the attempt to incorporate national symbols into the design of the legislative chambers, but the assignment of symbols to the respective chambers needs to be accurate.  The choice of themes for each chamber is deliberate and symbolic.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember that the questions below are designed to be challenging and may require in-depth knowledge of the subjects.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Guru Nanak's teachings emphasized religious tolerance, advocating for the unity of all people under one divine force, a concept particularly relevant in today's diverse world.
2. Dadu Dayal's preachings, unlike Guru Nanak's, primarily focused on the rejection of idol worship and the importance of selfless service, gaining prominence during the Mughal era.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a core tenet of Guru Nanak's Sikhism:  the concept of Ik Onkar (One God) and the inherent equality of all humankind, irrespective of religious affiliation.  This emphasis on religious tolerance remains highly relevant in contemporary global affairs.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Dadu Dayal did reject idol worship and emphasized selfless service (similar to Guru Nanak's concept of Seva),  the characterization of his preachings as *primarily* focused on these aspects at the expense of other religious and philosophical dimensions is an oversimplification.  Furthermore, although he preached during the Mughal period, framing his focus as solely on the rejection of idol worship and selfless service is a distortion of the nuances of his teachings.  His philosophy, while sharing similarities with Nirguna Bhakti, also had its unique characteristics.  The emphasis on the Mughal period also misleads as his philosophy transcended specific political contexts.


**2. With reference to the Ghadar Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Kartar Singh Sarabha, a key figure in the Ghadar Party, edited the Punjabi edition of the party's mouthpiece, *Ghadar*, and was executed at the age of 20 for his role in advocating for India's independence from British rule.
2. The Ghadar Movement, primarily orchestrated by Indian expatriates in North America, aimed to overthrow British colonial rule through a combination of armed rebellion and widespread civil disobedience, significantly influencing later freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 contains an inaccuracy regarding Sarabha's age at execution. While he was indeed a leading member of the Ghadar Party and edited the Punjabi edition of *Ghadar*, he was executed at the age of 19, not 20. This slight chronological error makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 correctly describes the Ghadar Movement's origins and aims.  It highlights the crucial role of Indian expatriates in North America and the movement's revolutionary goals. The influence on subsequent freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh is also a well-established historical fact, making this statement correct.  The statement avoids oversimplification by acknowledging both armed rebellion and other forms of resistance.


**3. With reference to the Bhoodan Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Acharya Vinoba Bhave, a staunch advocate of Ahimsa (non-violence) and considered the National Teacher of India, initiated the Bhoodan Movement to address agrarian inequalities by encouraging landowners to voluntarily donate land to the landless.
2. The Bhoodan Movement, a key component of the Sarvodaya movement, aimed to redistribute land ownership through legal means, resulting in significant land reforms across India and significantly reducing rural poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Acharya Vinoba Bhave as the initiator of the Bhoodan Movement and accurately describes its core aim:  the voluntary donation of land by landowners to the landless.  His philosophy of Ahimsa and his status as a prominent figure in Indian social reform are also accurate.

Statement 2 is largely incorrect.  While the Bhoodan Movement was part of Sarvodaya and aimed at land redistribution, it did *not* primarily rely on legal means.  The movement's success was largely dependent on voluntary donations, and its impact on land reforms and poverty reduction, while significant in certain areas, was not uniformly widespread across India.  The claim of significant reduction in rural poverty is an overstatement.  The movement’s impact was more on social consciousness than large scale land reforms.


**4. With reference to the life and works of Tyagaraja, consider the following statements:**

1. Tyagaraja, a renowned Carnatic music composer of the 18th and 19th centuries, primarily composed devotional songs in praise of Lord Rama, significantly contributing to the development of kriti as a musical form within Carnatic music.
2. Tyagaraja, along with Syama Sastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar, formed the Trinity of Carnatic music, composing numerous kritis that continue to be central to Carnatic music performances and profoundly influencing subsequent generations of Carnatic musicians.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Tyagaraja was indeed a prominent Carnatic composer of the 18th and early 19th centuries, and his compositions, primarily devotional songs dedicated to Lord Rama, played a crucial role in shaping the *kriti* form.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Tyagaraja is indeed part of the Trinity of Carnatic music, along with Syama Sastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar. Their combined works form the foundation of Carnatic music's repertoire and have profoundly influenced the tradition's evolution.


**5. With reference to the Ahom Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Lachit Borphukan, a renowned Ahom military commander, employed innovative guerrilla warfare tactics in the Battle of Saraighat (1671), decisively defeating the Mughal forces and halting their eastward expansion into Assam.  His strategies significantly influenced India's naval development.
2. The Ahom Kingdom, established in the 13th century, was characterized by a unique political system that blended elements of monarchy with decentralized local governance, flourishing for six centuries before its eventual annexation to British India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately portrays Lachit Borphukan's military prowess and the significance of the Battle of Saraighat. His innovative tactics, particularly in naval warfare, are well-documented and his influence on subsequent Indian naval thinking is a valid point.

Statement 2 correctly describes the Ahom Kingdom's longevity and its unique political structure. The blend of centralized and decentralized power is a key aspect of Ahom governance, and the six-century reign before British annexation is historically accurate.


**6. With reference to Rani Lakshmibai, consider the following statements:**

1. Rani Lakshmibai, born Manikarnika Tambe in Varanasi, received rigorous training in martial arts and horsemanship, showcasing exceptional bravery and military skills which she demonstrated in the 1857 Revolt. The British annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse.
2. Rani Lakshmibai's resistance against the British East India Company during the 1857 Revolt stemmed primarily from her desire to protect the rights of her adopted son and preserve the sovereignty of the Jhansi state, resulting in her becoming a symbol of Indian resistance against colonial rule.  The British offered her a pension but she refused it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Rani Lakshmibai's early life, training, and the context of the British annexation of Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse.  Her exceptional military skills and bravery are well-established aspects of her legacy.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the motivations behind Rani Lakshmibai's rebellion. The protection of her adopted son's rights and the preservation of Jhansi's sovereignty were indeed central to her resistance against the British.  Her refusal of pension is a well-known fact.  The statement avoids oversimplification by focusing on her motivations without neglecting the broader context of the 1857 revolt.


**7. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, advocated for the revival of Vedic principles, rejecting idolatry and ritualistic excesses, and promoted social reforms such as the abolition of child marriage and untouchability.  He started the cow protection movement.
2. The Arya Samaj, established in Bombay in 1875, played a significant role in the Indian independence movement, actively participating in the Swadeshi movement and advocating for complete Swaraj, even though it faced internal divisions and splits later. The constitution of Arya Samaj was finalized in Lahore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Swami Dayanand Saraswati's key contributions and the Arya Samaj's core tenets.  The emphasis on Vedic principles, rejection of idolatry, and promotion of social reforms are all historically accurate.  The cow protection movement is also a key Arya Samaj initiative.

Statement 2 is also largely correct. The Arya Samaj's establishment in Bombay and the finalization of its constitution in Lahore are accurate.  Its participation in the Swadeshi movement and advocacy for Swaraj are also well-documented, although its direct role in the independence movement, while present, was not as central as that of the Indian National Congress.  The later internal divisions are also accurate.


**8.  Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rejang Dewa, a sacred Balinese dance, is a key element of the Ngusaba Goreng festival, a two-week-long harvest thanksgiving ritual characterized by traditional dances performed primarily by young girls and women.
2.  The Reang community, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Tripura, practices Jhum cultivation and primarily follows traditional animistic beliefs, distinct from Buddhism, and has requested official recognition for their language, Kaubru.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is assessed as "difficult" for each question due to the nuanced nature of the factual recall and analysis required.

**1. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jyotiba Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj primarily focused on advocating for the rights of the depressed classes within the existing varna system, rather than seeking its complete dismantling.
2.  Sri Narayana Guru's philosophy of "One Caste, One Religion, One God" directly challenged the hierarchical structure of the varna system and promoted social equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jyotiba Phule's Satyashodhak Samaj did work within the existing social framework to uplift the depressed classes,  his broader aim was to challenge and ultimately dismantle the oppressive caste system, not merely reform it. He actively critiqued Brahmanical domination and the inherent inequalities within the varna system.  His writings like *Gulamgiri* (Slavery) directly attacked the foundations of the caste system.

Statement 2 is correct. Sri Narayana Guru's philosophy explicitly rejected the caste system's inherent inequalities by promoting the principle of "One Caste, One Religion, One God." This directly challenged the hierarchical structure and the discriminatory practices embedded within the varna system. His aim was to create a society based on social equality and unity, transcending the limitations of caste.  This is evident in his efforts to uplift the Ezhava community and his broader social reform work.


**2. With reference to the tribal communities and their movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rampa Rebellion, led by Alluri Sitarama Raju, primarily focused on opposing the British government's policies regarding forest rights and traditional agricultural practices like Podu cultivation.
2.  Birsa Munda's Ulgulan movement primarily aimed at achieving complete political independence from British rule through armed rebellion,  similar to the approach adopted by Alluri Sitarama Raju.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rampa Rebellion, while having broader anti-colonial implications, was fundamentally triggered by British policies that restricted tribal access to forest resources and banned the traditional Podu cultivation system.  These policies directly impacted the livelihoods and cultural practices of the tribal communities, leading to widespread resentment and the rebellion. Alluri Sitarama Raju used guerrilla warfare tactics, but the movement's core was resisting these specific economic and social injustices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Birsa Munda's Ulgulan movement did oppose the exploitation and discrimination against tribals, its focus was primarily on socio-religious reform and asserting tribal identity and rights within the existing colonial structure, not necessarily achieving immediate political independence through large-scale armed conflict as Alluri Sitarama Raju attempted.  Birsa Munda's movement emphasized a code of conduct, faith in God, and rejection of alcohol, establishing the Birsait faith. The movement indirectly led to legislative changes like the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act, but its primary means were not armed rebellion for outright independence.


**3. With reference to the Constituent Assembly of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constituent Assembly's membership was entirely based on direct elections under adult franchise, ensuring broad-based representation of all sections of Indian society.
2.  Sachchidananda Sinha served as the permanent President of the Constituent Assembly, playing a crucial role in its proceedings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constituent Assembly's membership wasn't solely based on direct elections under adult franchise. While a significant portion of the members were elected by provincial assemblies, the representation of princely states was through nomination, not direct election. This created a less than fully representative body. The electoral system used in the provincial assemblies themselves was also not uniform across India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sachchidananda Sinha served only as the *temporary* President of the Constituent Assembly.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad was later elected as the permanent President and chaired most of its sessions.  Sinha's role, though significant, was limited to the initial phase of the Assembly's formation.


**4. With reference to the cultural heritage of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Konark Sun Temple's chariot design, featuring seven horses, symbolizes the seven chakras (energy centers) in the human body, as described in ancient Hindu scriptures.
2.  The Sacred Ensembles of Hoysalas, including the Chennakeshava Temple at Belur, prominently showcase the Vesara style of architecture which is a unique blend of Dravidian and Nagara architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the seven horses of the Konark Sun Temple chariot are significant, their symbolic representation is primarily linked to the seven colours of the rainbow and the rhythmic representation of the Vedas, not directly to the seven chakras of the human body as per Hindu scriptures.  Various interpretations exist regarding the symbolic meaning of the Konark wheel, but the chakra interpretation is not the most widely accepted one.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sacred Ensembles of Hoysalas indeed exemplify the Vesara style of architecture, a distinctive hybrid style that uniquely combines elements of both Dravidian and Nagara architectural traditions. The temples of Belur, Halebidu, and Somanathapura showcase this blend, characterized by intricate carvings and a stellate plan. The influence of Bhumija style is also evident, reflecting the architectural confluence of the region.


**5. With reference to significant personalities in Indian history, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahilyabai Holkar, the 18th-century queen of Malwa, is primarily known for her patronage of the arts and literature, particularly in the city of Maheshwar, where she established a renowned textile industry.
2.  Raja Ravi Varma's contribution to Indian art lies mainly in his pioneering use of lithography to make affordable reproductions of his paintings accessible to the masses, thereby popularizing Indian mythological themes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign is indeed marked by significant patronage of arts, literature, and industry. Maheshwar flourished as a center for textile production during her rule,  and she is also known for her extensive temple restoration work.  Her contributions significantly enriched the cultural landscape of Malwa.

Statement 2 is correct. Raja Ravi Varma's innovative use of lithography was crucial in making his art widely accessible. This played a significant role in popularizing Indian mythological themes among the masses,  bridging the gap between high art and popular culture.  He successfully combined Indian artistic traditions with European techniques, creating a unique style that influenced generations of artists.


**6. With reference to the various awards conferred in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sahitya Akademi Award recognizes outstanding literary works published in the 22 languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, but does not include English or Rajasthani as major languages.
2.  The Sangeet Natak Akademi Amrit Awards are conferred annually on performing artists, teachers, and scholars aged 75 years and above, who have not received any other national honor before.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Award does indeed recognize outstanding literary works in the 22 languages of the Eighth Schedule, but it also extends its recognition to English and Rajasthani, acknowledging their significant presence in Indian literature.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sangeet Natak Akademi Amrit Awards are a one-time honor bestowed upon Indian performing artists, teachers, and scholars who have reached the age of 75 and have not yet received any national award. The award aims to recognize their lifetime contributions and is a significant achievement in the field of performing arts.  The award is given only once and is not annual.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Companies Act, 2013, mandates the formation of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) for all Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects exceeding ₹100 crore.
2.  The Companies Act, 2013, explicitly defines the criteria for "Accredited Investors" solely based on their net worth, excluding any consideration of investment experience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Companies Act, 2013, governs the formation of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), it doesn't mandate their creation for *all* PPP projects exceeding a certain value. The decision to form an SPV depends on various project-specific factors and contractual agreements.  Many PPP projects utilize SPVs, but it's not a universal legal requirement under the Act.  The size threshold of ₹100 crore is also not explicitly mentioned in the act for mandatory SPV formation in PPP projects.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Companies Act, 2013, does define "Accredited Investors," but the criteria extend beyond just net worth.  It considers factors like investment experience and knowledge to determine an investor's accreditation status.  The act doesn't solely rely on net worth as the sole determinant.


**2. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI, published by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, exclusively tracks the prices of goods and services consumed by urban households, excluding rural areas.
2.  The weighting scheme used in the CPI calculation remains static and unchanged over time to ensure consistency in inflation measurement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPI tracks the average change in prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services over time. This basket includes both rural and urban areas, reflecting the consumption patterns of the entire population.  The Ministry of Labour and Employment does play a role in the CPI data but it is primarily published by the National Statistical Office (NSO).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The weighting scheme used in CPI calculations is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in consumer spending habits and the relative importance of different goods and services in the economy. A static weighting would lead to an inaccurate representation of inflation over time.


**3. With reference to Blockchain technology, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Blockchain Service, a prominent Indian initiative, utilizes blockchain technology primarily for tracking the movement of goods across international borders.
2. Warehouse Receipt Finance, a crucial aspect of agricultural finance, is significantly enhanced by blockchain technology's immutability and transparency features, thereby reducing information asymmetry.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the National Blockchain Service utilizes blockchain, its applications are broader than just international goods tracking.  It's designed to facilitate various government services and initiatives across multiple sectors. The primary focus is not limited to international trade.

Statement 2 is correct.  Blockchain technology's inherent immutability and transparency features are highly beneficial for Warehouse Receipt Finance. By providing a secure and auditable record of transactions, it reduces information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers, thereby facilitating easier access to credit for farmers.


**4. With reference to Cryptocurrencies, consider the following statements:**

1.  All cryptocurrencies are inherently decentralized and operate independently of any central bank or government regulation.
2. The "Bitcoin Halving" event, a significant occurrence in the Bitcoin blockchain, directly impacts the cryptocurrency's supply by reducing the rate of new Bitcoin creation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many cryptocurrencies strive for decentralization, some have elements of central control or are subject to varying degrees of regulatory oversight.  Decentralization is a spectrum and not a binary characteristic of all cryptocurrencies.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Bitcoin Halving" is a programmed event in the Bitcoin protocol that reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created (mined) by half. This directly influences the cryptocurrency's supply and is a key factor affecting its price.


**5. With reference to the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPA, under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, has the power to directly regulate the prices of essential consumer goods.
2.  The CCPA can conduct investigations into violations of consumer rights and impose penalties, but it cannot directly set up consumer tribunals to resolve disputes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCPA's powers do not include direct price regulation of consumer goods.  Price regulation typically falls under different government bodies or regulatory commissions.

Statement 2 is correct. The CCPA has the authority to investigate consumer rights violations and impose penalties on erring businesses. However, the establishment and operation of consumer tribunals are separate legal processes defined under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and are not directly under the CCPA’s jurisdiction.  The CCPA can refer cases to these tribunals.


**6. With reference to the Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NBC is a fiscal policy tool used by the central government to limit the borrowing capacity of state governments, primarily to prevent excessive state debt.
2. The NBC for each state is calculated as a fixed percentage of the state's projected Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the fiscal year, but the percentage varies depending on the state's fiscal health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC) is indeed a fiscal policy tool employed by the central government to regulate the borrowing limits of state governments. This is a crucial aspect of fiscal federalism in India, aiming to maintain macroeconomic stability and prevent unsustainable debt levels at the state level.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The NBC is expressed as a percentage of each state's projected GSDP. While a standard percentage is often set, the actual limit for each state can be adjusted based on their individual fiscal position and debt sustainability assessments.  The central government considers various factors before finalizing the NBC for each state.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1. Remnants of sesame seeds have been discovered at both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, indicating its cultivation during the Indus Valley Civilization.
2. Sesame oil's medicinal benefits are primarily attributed to its high content of monounsaturated fatty acids, which contribute to cardiovascular health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Archaeological evidence supports the presence of sesame seeds at both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, suggesting its cultivation during the Indus Valley Civilization. This highlights the ancient history of sesame as an oilseed crop in the Indian subcontinent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While sesame oil does offer health benefits, its medicinal properties are largely due to its antioxidant content, specifically sesamol and sesamin, rather than primarily monounsaturated fatty acids.  Although monounsaturated fats are present and beneficial, they are not the *primary* reason for the medicinal value.  Antioxidant properties are more emphasized in research regarding its medicinal uses.


**8. With reference to the Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT), consider the following statements:**

1.  CENVAT is applicable to both the manufacture of goods and the provision of services, allowing for input tax credit across these sectors.
2. Under CENVAT, tax credits can be claimed only for inputs directly used in the manufacturing process, excluding input services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) system, which has been subsumed under the GST, applied to both the manufacture of goods and the provision of services. A key feature of CENVAT was the allowance of input tax credit, meaning businesses could deduct the tax paid on inputs (both goods and services) from their output tax liability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Under CENVAT, tax credits were allowed not only for direct inputs used in manufacturing but also for input services that were essential for the production process. This comprehensive input tax credit mechanism was a significant feature of CENVAT design.


**9. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1. NBFCs are permitted to issue cheques drawn on themselves, functioning similarly to commercial banks in this aspect.
2.  NBFCs can acquire shares, stocks, bonds, and marketable securities, but their primary function is to operate deposit schemes in various formats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NBFCs are not authorized to issue cheques drawn on themselves. This is a key distinction between NBFCs and commercial banks.  NBFCs don't have the same deposit-taking powers as banks.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While NBFCs can indeed invest in shares, stocks, bonds, and marketable securities, their primary function is not to operate deposit schemes.  Their core business activities typically involve lending and financing, rather than accepting deposits from the general public.  Accepting deposits is a key function of banks but not of NBFCs.


**10. With reference to Basic Animal Husbandry Statistics 2024 (the data presented here is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) program indeed guarantees a minimum of 100 days of unskilled manual wage employment to rural households.  This is a key provision of the act aimed at providing employment and livelihood security.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  MGNREGA is a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning that both the central and state governments share the financial burden. The cost-sharing ratio varies over time, but it's not solely funded by the central government.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Stock exchanges contribute to the IPF through a percentage of listing fees, not trading profits.  The contribution mechanism is specifically related to listing fees and other specified charges.

Statement 2 is correct. A significant portion of the ISF is allocated for investor education and awareness programs, with a focus on reaching Tier II and Tier III cities to promote wider participation in the market.


**21. With reference to the Social Stock Exchange (SSE), consider the following statements:**

1.  Only Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) are eligible to raise funds on the SSE.
2.  Social Enterprises seeking to list on the SSE must demonstrate a predominant focus on social impact, as measured by criteria such as revenue, expenditure, and beneficiaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) and For-Profit Enterprises (FPEs) can raise funds on the SSE, provided they meet the eligibility criteria.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key requirement for listing on the SSE is to demonstrate a substantial commitment to social impact. This is assessed through the proportion of revenue generated from social activities, the proportion of expenditure allocated to social activities, and the number of beneficiaries served.  This ensures that the SSE promotes genuine social enterprises.


**22. With reference to Exchange Rate Management in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India currently operates under a completely fixed exchange rate system, where the Rupee's value is pegged to a basket of major currencies.
2.  Exchange rate fluctuations in India are influenced by factors such as interest rates, inflation, and capital flows.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India operates under a managed floating exchange rate system, not a completely fixed one. While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to manage volatility, the Rupee's value is primarily determined by market forces of supply and demand.  It is not rigidly pegged to any currency or basket of currencies.

Statement 2 is correct.  Various factors influence exchange rate fluctuations in India. Interest rate differentials between India and other countries, inflation rates, and capital flows (foreign investment and remittances) all play significant roles in determining the Rupee's value against other currencies.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) encompasses all industrial units registered in India, irrespective of their size or nature of operation.
2.  In the ASI's Gross Value Addition ranking for 2023, Uttar Pradesh secured a position among the top five states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI, while being the principal source of industrial statistics in India, does *not* cover all industrial units.  It specifically covers factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948, and certain other specified units like those under the Bidi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966.  Crucially, it excludes entities such as defense establishments and oil storage and distribution depots. This omission of significant industrial players means the ASI's coverage is not exhaustive.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that in the Gross Value Addition ranking from the ASI, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh were among the top five states.  Therefore, Uttar Pradesh's inclusion in this top-five list is factually accurate according to the source material.  The question's design uses the misleading nature of statement 1 to create a distractor.  A candidate might mistakenly assume the ASI's comprehensive nature, leading to an incorrect choice.


**2. With reference to the Indian Consumer Protection Act, 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) is empowered to impose penalties only on manufacturers who engage in unfair trade practices.
2.  The Act came into effect in July 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCPA's powers extend beyond penalizing manufacturers.  The Act grants the CCPA the authority to impose penalties on manufacturers, *endorsers*, and *publishers* of misleading advertisements, not just manufacturers involved in unfair trade practices. This broader scope of the CCPA's enforcement capabilities is a key feature of the Act, designed to address the multifaceted nature of consumer protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act came into force in July 2020, not July 2019. This seemingly minor detail serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the Act's implementation timeline.  The slight alteration of the year cleverly misleads candidates who may have a general understanding of the Act but lack precise recall of its enactment date.


**3. With reference to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Companies with a net worth of ₹500 crore or more are mandated to allocate 1% of their average net profits over the last three years to CSR activities.
2.  The non-compliance penalty for responsible officers can include imprisonment up to 2 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The prescribed allocation for CSR activities is 2% of the average net profits over the last three years, not 1%. This seemingly small numerical difference is a crucial detail that distinguishes between correct and incorrect understanding of the CSR regulations.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall precise numerical data within the regulatory framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The maximum imprisonment for non-compliance by responsible officers is 3 years, not 2 years.  Again, a slight alteration in the numerical data—the length of potential imprisonment—is used to create a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to recall specific details from the provided information.  The seemingly minor difference is crucial for a correct response.


**4. With reference to the Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NBC is a monetary policy tool used to regulate state government borrowings.
2. For the fiscal year 2023-24, the NBC is set at 4% of each state’s projected Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NBC is a *fiscal* policy tool, not a monetary policy tool. This fundamental distinction in economic policy is a key element of the question, testing the candidate's understanding of the difference between fiscal and monetary policies and their application in the Indian context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NBC for the fiscal year 2023-24 is set at 3% of each state’s projected GSDP, not 4%.  The slight difference in the percentage is designed as a distractor, targeting the candidate's ability to accurately recall the specific numerical value of the NBC.  The question tests precise factual recall.


**5. With reference to  Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), consider the following statements:**

1. FPI provides the investor with direct ownership of a company’s assets.
2.  FPIs holdings can include American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that FPI *does not* provide direct ownership of a company's assets; it's an investment in securities, not direct ownership.  This is a crucial distinction between FPI and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the core concept of FPI.

Statement 2 is correct. The text lists ADRs as one of the assets included in FPI holdings. This tests the candidate's ability to recall specific examples of assets included within FPI.  The contrast between the incorrect statement 1 and the correct statement 2 makes the question challenging.


**6. With reference to the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), consider the following statements:**

1. NFRA was constituted in 2017 under Section 132(1) of the Companies Act, 2013.
2. NFRA oversees the compliance of all companies registered in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NFRA was constituted in 2018, not 2017. While the text mentions Section 132(1) of the Companies Act, 2013, as the basis for its establishment, the year is a crucial detail that distinguishes correct from incorrect knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NFRA's oversight is primarily focused on large companies and specific classes of companies, not *all* companies registered in India. The question uses the potentially misleading generality of statement 2 to create a distractor.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of NFRA's scope.


**7. With reference to Retail Inflation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Retail inflation is measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI).
2. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in India is categorized into CPI for only urban areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Retail inflation in India is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), not the Producer Price Index (PPI).  This fundamental difference in economic indicators is a key element of the question.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CPI in India is categorized into CPI for both urban *and* rural areas, not just urban areas. The question uses the potentially misleading limitation in statement 2 to create a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the CPI's categorization.


**8. With reference to Blockchain Technology, consider the following statements:**

1. Blockchain networks utilize consensus algorithms to validate transactions and maintain network integrity, ensuring that only illegitimate transactions are added to the chain.
2.  Blockchain technology is a centralized, distributed ledger system.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly states that blockchain ensures only *illegitimate* transactions are added.  The opposite is true: blockchain's consensus mechanisms ensure only *legitimate* transactions are added, enhancing security and transparency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Blockchain technology is *decentralized*, not centralized.  This fundamental characteristic is a core concept in understanding blockchain technology.  The question uses the contrasting terms "centralized" and "decentralized" to create a significant distractor.


**9. With reference to Cryptocurrency, consider the following statements:**

1. Cryptocurrencies are typically controlled by a central authority, making them susceptible to government interference.
2. Cryptocurrency operates on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The defining characteristic of cryptocurrencies is their *lack* of central control, making them theoretically immune to government manipulation.  This is a crucial point in understanding the nature of cryptocurrencies.

Statement 2 is correct.  Cryptocurrencies rely on decentralized networks and blockchain technology for their operation. This core characteristic is essential for understanding cryptocurrencies' functionality and security.  The contrast between the incorrect and correct statements makes the question challenging.


**10. With reference to the geographical conditions for rubber production, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that rubber is generally grown up to 300 meters above sea level, not exceeding 500 meters. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall precise numerical data about the altitudinal limits of rubber cultivation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the ideal annual rainfall for rubber production is between 1,800-2,500 mm, not 2,000-2,800 mm.  Again, the question uses a slight alteration of the correct rainfall range to create a challenging distractor. The question primarily tests factual recall of specific numerical data.


**11. With reference to Kodo Millet, consider the following statements:**

1. Kodo millet (Paspalum scrobiculatum) is primarily cultivated in the northern plains of India.
2.  The phosphorus content in kodo millet is significantly higher than other millets.

This seemingly minor detail is a crucial difference that tests the candidate's precise recall of factual information.  The contrast between the correct and incorrect statements makes the question challenging.


**13.  Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sabroom Land Port (SLP) in Tripura is connected to the Mongla port of Bangladesh.
2.  Currently, there are 12 operational land ports in India, excluding the SLP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

1. NBFCs are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. NBFCs are allowed to issue banknotes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in overseeing the financial activities of NBFCs, they are primarily registered under the Companies Act, 1956, and not directly regulated by the RBI.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the regulatory framework for NBFCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NBFCs are not authorized to issue banknotes; that is the exclusive prerogative of the central bank (RBI) in India.  This fundamental difference in powers between NBFCs and the RBI is a key element of the question. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the limitations of NBFCs' operations.


**16. Consider the following statements:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that the facilities at Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru, and Padur were established under *Phase-I*, not Phase-II, of the SPR program.  The question tests precise recall of the phases of the SPR program.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Limited, a Special Purpose Vehicle under MoPNG, manages the SPRs.  The contrast between the incorrect and correct statements enhances the question's difficulty.


**20. With reference to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), consider the following statements:**

1. CBAM is a tariff barrier imposed by the EU on carbon-intensive goods from non-EU countries.
2.  The CBAM becomes fully operational in its definitive phase on 1 January 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CBAM is a *non-tariff barrier* (NTB), not a tariff barrier. The distinction between tariff and non-tariff barriers is crucial for understanding international trade policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CBAM's definitive phase begins on 1 January 2026, not 2025.  The question uses a slight alteration of the correct implementation date to serve as a distractor, testing precise recall.  The question assesses both conceptual understanding and factual recall.


**21.  With reference to Debt for Climate Swaps, consider the following statements:**

1.  In a debt for climate swap, the debtor nation makes payments in a foreign currency to finance domestic climate projects.
2. India has actively participated in several debt for nature swaps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In a debt for climate swap, payments are made in *local* currency, not foreign currency, to fund domestic climate projects.  The question tests understanding of the core mechanism of debt for climate swaps.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that India has *not* been involved in any debt for nature swaps.  The question uses the misleading assertion in statement 2 as a distractor.


**22. With reference to the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s Strategy on the Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, consider the following statements:**

1. The strategy aims to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 50% by 2030, compared to 2008 levels.
2.  The shipping industry accounts for approximately 5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target for CO2 emission reduction is at least 40%, not 50%, by 2030 compared to 2008 levels.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall precise numerical data within the IMO's strategy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The shipping industry accounts for approximately 2.89% of anthropogenic GHG emissions, not 5%. The question uses the inflated percentage in statement 2 as a distractor.  The question focuses on precise numerical data recall.


**23. With reference to the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NFCS was proposed under the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) and is coordinated by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
2.  The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is the nodal agency for the NFCS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the NFCS is indeed proposed under the GFCS, it is coordinated by the IMD, which falls under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, not the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. This difference in ministries serves as a crucial distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly names the IMD as the nodal agency for the NFCS.  The contrast between the incorrect and correct statements makes the question challenging.


**24.  Consider the following statements:**

1.  The India Climate Energy Dashboard (ICED) 3.0 is a platform that provides real-time data exclusively on India's renewable energy sector.
2.  The Green Shift report, submitted by ETAC, focuses solely on the transition to hydrogen energy in India's oil and gas sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ICED 3.0 provides data on the broader energy sector, encompassing climate and related economic datasets, not solely renewable energy. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the scope of ICED 3.0.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Green Shift report advocates for a broader adoption of clean energy solutions, including hydrogen, biofuels, nuclear, geothermal, and tidal energy, not just hydrogen.  The question uses the limited scope in statement 2 as a distractor.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the Green Shift report's recommendations.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEEI 2023 assesses the performance of 36 states and UTs, not 35. The question uses a slight numerical alteration to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Karnataka was the top performer and has an active Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency Policy.  The question uses the incorrect statement 1 as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of factual information.


**26. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY), consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme provides a monthly pension of ₹4,000 to eligible farmers upon reaching the age of 60.
2.  The scheme is exclusively for farmers with land holdings exceeding 2 hectares.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The monthly pension amount under PM-KMY is ₹3,000, not ₹4,000. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall the precise numerical value of the pension amount.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The eligibility criteria for PM-KMY include land holdings *up to* 2 hectares, not exceeding 2 hectares.  The question uses the opposite condition in statement 2 to create a challenging distractor.  The question focuses on precise factual recall.


**27. With reference to the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMEO-OP aims to increase the area under oil palm cultivation to 15 lakh hectares by 2025-26.
2.  Oil palm cultivation is primarily concentrated in the southern states of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target for oil palm area expansion under NMEO-OP is 10 lakh hectares by 2025-26, not 15 lakh hectares. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall the precise target set by the NMEO-OP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the southern states have potential for oil palm cultivation,  the NMEO-OP specifically targets the northeast and Andaman and Nicobar Islands for special focus in expansion. The question uses a geographically misleading statement to create a challenging distractor.


**28. With reference to the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), consider the following statements:**

1.  The MIDH is a centrally sponsored scheme implemented since 2015-16.
2.  Under MIDH, the central government's contribution to North Eastern and Himalayan states is 60%.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifically states that the 2020-2023 Triple Dip La Niña event did *not* follow a strong El Niño.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the unusual characteristics of this specific La Niña event.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the improved air quality in North India during the winter of 2022-23, coinciding with the Triple Dip La Niña.  The question uses the incorrect statement 1 as a distractor.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. WINDS aims to generate *long-term*, hyper-local weather data, not short-term data, and it's intended to benefit both rural and urban areas, focusing particularly on agricultural applications. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the scope and objectives of WINDS.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the WINDS program will involve the installation of more than 2 lakh ground stations.  The contrast between the incorrect and correct statements makes the question challenging.  The question focuses on precise numerical data recall.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question features two statements requiring factual recall and analysis, with four options and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act of 1934 mandates that the RBI must act as the banker to the Central Government, but not to State Governments.
2.  The RBI's primary role in managing the country's currency and credit is enshrined in the Constitution of India, ensuring its autonomy in monetary policy decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI Act, 1934, designates the RBI as the banker to the Central Government.  While the RBI interacts extensively with State Governments, providing financial services and advice, this role is not a statutory mandate under the 1934 Act. The relationship is more of a collaborative nature than a direct, legally binding obligation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI's role in managing currency and credit is primarily defined by the RBI Act, 1934, and not explicitly enshrined in the Constitution of India. While the Constitution establishes the framework for a central bank and monetary policy, it doesn't detail the RBI's specific functions or its operational autonomy to the extent suggested.  The Constitution's provisions are broad, leaving the specifics to legislation like the RBI Act.  Therefore, the statement misrepresents the constitutional basis of the RBI's powers.


**2. With reference to the National Pension System (NPS) Trust, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NPS Trust, established under the Indian Trusts Act of 1882, is solely responsible for managing the investments of the NPS funds, without any regulatory oversight from PFRDA.
2.  Amendments to the NPS Trust regulations in 2023 simplified the process for appointing trustees but introduced stricter 'fit and proper' criteria for principal officers of sponsor banks, aligning them with the Companies Act, 2013.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NPS Trust is established under the Indian Trusts Act of 1882, it is not independent of PFRDA oversight.  The PFRDA Act, 2013, and subsequent regulations grant PFRDA significant regulatory authority over the NPS Trust, including its investment guidelines and operational aspects.  The statement erroneously suggests complete autonomy for the Trust.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 2023 amendments to the NPS Trust regulations streamlined the trustee appointment process.  Simultaneously, they introduced enhanced 'fit and proper' criteria for principal officers, aligning their standards with the Companies Act, 2013. This enhanced regulatory scrutiny aims to improve governance and risk management within the NPS framework.


**3. With reference to the functions of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1.  PACS, registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, primarily function as providers of long-term credit loans to farmers, supplementing government-sponsored schemes like PM-KISAN.
2.  In 2022, PACS disbursed 95% of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans to small and marginal farmers, highlighting their crucial role in financial inclusion within the agricultural sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are primarily known for providing *short-term*, not long-term, credit loans to farmers. While they play a role in supporting farmers' financial needs, PM-KISAN is a direct income support scheme, not directly linked to PACS lending.  The statement incorrectly characterizes the duration of their credit services.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided data accurately reflects the significant contribution of PACS to KCC loan disbursement in 2022, particularly towards small and marginal farmers.  This emphasizes their vital role in extending financial services and promoting financial inclusion within the agricultural sector.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Cooperative Database (NCD), inaugurated by the Ministry of Cooperation, provides comprehensive information exclusively on PACS, excluding other cooperative entities.
2.  The Centrally Sponsored Project for Computerisation of PACS aims to computerize all functional PACS across India, regardless of their current operational status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Cooperative Database (NCD) is designed to provide information on the *entire* cooperative sector, not just PACS.  Its scope encompasses all types of cooperatives operating in India.  The statement incorrectly limits the NCD's coverage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Centrally Sponsored Project for Computerisation of PACS aims to computerize a specific number of *functional* PACS (63,000), not all functional PACS.  The project targets a subset of the existing functional PACS for computerization, not a complete nationwide overhaul.  The statement overstates the project's ambition.


**5. With reference to the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), consider the following statements:**

1.  KVKs, under the National Agricultural Research System (NARS), primarily focus on conducting research and developing new crop varieties, independently of State Agricultural Universities (SAUs).
2.  The first KVK was established in 1974 at Puducherry under the administrative control of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), not a State Agricultural University.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. KVKs are integral to NARS but their primary function is not solely research and development of new crop varieties. While they do conduct on-farm testing and demonstrations of new technologies, their role also includes providing advisory services, training, and disseminating knowledge from SAUs and ICAR to farmers. They act as a bridge between research and extension.  The statement misrepresents their core function.

Statement 2 is correct. The first KVK was indeed established in 1974 at Puducherry. However, it was established under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), Coimbatore, and not directly under ICAR.  ICAR provides overall guidance and coordination within NARS, but the administrative control for this initial KVK rested with TNAU.


**6. With reference to the Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CCSCH, established in 2013 under the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), is responsible for developing mandatory international standards for spices and herbs, enforceable by WTO member states.
2.  India hosts the CCSCH Secretariat, with the Spices Board of India (under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry) acting as the administrative body, ensuring Indian influence in global spice standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Codex standards developed by CCSCH are *voluntary*, not mandatory.  While the WTO encourages harmonization of national regulations with international standards, the Codex texts themselves do not carry legal binding power on member states.  The statement incorrectly describes the legally binding nature of Codex standards.

Statement 2 is correct.  India has hosted the CCSCH Secretariat since its inception in 2013, and the Spices Board of India (under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry) acts as the Secretariat organization. This gives India a significant role in shaping the development of international spice standards.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Banks Heralding Accelerated Rural & Agriculture Transformation (BHARAT) campaign, launched as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, focuses solely on providing subsidized credit to individual farmers, excluding other stakeholders in the agricultural sector.
2.  Under the BHARAT campaign, banks offer loans with a 3% interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹2 crore, benefiting farmers, SHGs, PACS, FPOs, and eligible community assets projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BHARAT campaign's scope extends beyond individual farmers to include a broader range of beneficiaries in the agricultural sector.  It aims to mobilize infrastructure development loans for various stakeholders, including SHGs, PACS, FPOs, and community assets projects.  The statement incorrectly restricts the campaign's target audience.

Statement 2 is correct.  The BHARAT campaign's financial support package accurately reflects the details provided: a 3% interest subvention on loans, credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹2 crore, and inclusion of various beneficiary categories.


**8. With reference to the formation and promotion of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The central sector scheme for forming 10,000 new FPOs by 2027-28 mandates a minimum membership of 500 farmers per FPO, regardless of the geographical location.
2.  FPOs receive financial assistance up to ₹18 lakh per FPO for three years, a matching equity grant up to ₹2,000 per farmer member (with a limit of ₹15 lakh per FPO), and a credit guarantee facility up to ₹2 crore per FPO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum membership requirement for FPOs varies depending on the geographical location.  It's 300 farmers in plains and 100 in North-Eastern and hilly areas. The statement presents an inaccurate uniform membership threshold.

Statement 2 is correct.  The financial assistance package for FPOs accurately reflects the specified amounts and conditions:  a grant of up to ₹18 lakh per FPO for three years, a matching equity grant up to ₹2,000 per member (capped at ₹15 lakh per FPO), and a credit guarantee facility of up to ₹2 crore.


**9. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM-KISAN scheme provides an annual income support of ₹8,000 to all landholding farmer families, distributed in four equal installments.
2.  The scheme mandates land records for beneficiary identification, with exceptions for forest dwellers in certain states and UTs, those whose monthly pension exceeds ₹10,000, and those paying income tax in the last assessment year.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM-KISAN scheme provides an annual income support of ₹6,000, not ₹8,000, distributed in three equal installments, not four.  The statement contains incorrect figures for both the annual amount and the number of installments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the scheme generally requires land records for beneficiary identification, the exceptions mentioned are not entirely accurate.  The exceptions include forest dwellers in certain states and UTs, but the pension threshold and income tax criteria are not absolute exclusions.  Other criteria, such as holding constitutional posts, are also part of the exclusion criteria. The statement provides an incomplete and partially incorrect list of exclusions.


**10.  With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMFBY covers all crops, including cereals, millets, pulses, oilseeds, and commercial horticultural crops, with a uniform premium rate of 5% of the sum assured for all crops.
2. The scheme offers basic coverage for yield losses due to non-preventable risks and optional add-on coverage for prevented sowing risks, but excludes losses due to war and nuclear risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMFBY covers a wide range of crops, the premium rate isn't uniform at 5%. It varies depending on the crop type (Kharif, Rabi, commercial horticultural crops) and the actuarial premium rate (APR) set by insurance companies. The premium is the lower of 5% of sum insured or APR for commercial horticultural crops. The statement provides an inaccurate, simplified representation of the premium structure.

Statement 2 is correct. PMFBY offers basic coverage for yield losses from non-preventable risks (like floods, droughts) and optional add-on coverage for prevented sowing risks.  Exclusions for losses due to war, nuclear risks, and malicious damage remain consistent with standard crop insurance practices.


**11. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Ombudsman Scheme, 2006, handles complaints related to deficiencies in services provided by all entities regulated by the RBI, including NBFCs and payment system participants, regardless of their asset size.
2. The Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) 2021, integrates the existing Ombudsman schemes of the RBI and adopts a ‘One Nation One Ombudsman’ approach, making the mechanism jurisdiction-neutral.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI Ombudsman Scheme 2006, *prior* to the integration under RB-IOS, had specific criteria for coverage based on asset size and type of institution.  Not all entities regulated by the RBI were automatically covered under the 2006 scheme.  The statement wrongly implies universal coverage under the older scheme.

Statement 2 is correct. The RB-IOS 2021 successfully integrated the existing three RBI Ombudsman schemes and implemented the ‘One Nation One Ombudsman’ approach, removing jurisdictional limitations in accessing the ombudsman mechanism.


**12. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  NUCFDC, registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company – Non-deposit (NBFC-ND), serves as an umbrella organization for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  A key function of NUCFDC is to facilitate regulatory compliance for UCBs, preparing smaller banks to meet the requirements of the Banking Regulation Act (BRA), 1949, and potentially reducing the need for mergers to achieve economies of scale.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a *Type II*, not Type I, NBFC-ND.  Type II NBFC-NDs have a customer interface and/or intend to accept public funds, unlike Type I NBFC-NDs. The statement misclassifies NUCFDC's RBI registration type.

Statement 2 is correct.  A primary function of NUCFDC is to assist UCBs in adhering to the BRA, 1949. By providing support for regulatory compliance, NUCFDC aims to strengthen the UCB sector, potentially reducing the necessity for mergers driven by the need to achieve economies of scale.


**13. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1.  Established in 2021, NaBFID is a specialized Development Finance Institution (DFI) regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), focusing on short-term infrastructure financing.
2.  NaBFID’s Act mandates that the Central Government must hold at least 51% of its shares, with the remaining shares available to multilateral institutions and other specified entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. It focuses on *long-term*, not short-term, infrastructure financing. The statement contains incorrect information regarding both the regulatory body and the duration of financing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NaBFID Act mandates that the Central Government hold at least 26%, not 51%, of its shares. The statement misrepresents the minimum shareholding requirement for the Central Government.


**14. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD) launched a credit guarantee scheme for the livestock sector with a ₹500 crore Credit Guarantee Fund Trust, covering up to 50% of credit facilities for MSMEs in the livestock sector.
2.  The Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF), established under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Stimulus Package, provides interest subvention and loans up to 90% of project cost for establishing infrastructure in the dairy, meat, and animal feed sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Credit Guarantee Fund Trust established by DAHD is for ₹750 crore, not ₹500 crore, and it provides credit guarantee coverage of up to 25%, not 50%, of credit facilities. The statement contains errors in both the fund amount and the percentage of guarantee coverage.

Statement 2 is correct. AHIDF, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Stimulus Package, does indeed offer interest subvention and loans covering up to 90% of project costs for various infrastructure developments within the livestock and allied sectors.


**15. With reference to the National Turmeric Board, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Turmeric Board, established under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, aims to increase domestic consumption and international exports of turmeric and turmeric products.
2.  Key objectives of the Board include creating and improving infrastructure for turmeric exports, ensuring quality and safety standards across the supply chain, and encouraging research on the health benefits of turmeric.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Turmeric Board is established under the aegis of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The statement incorrectly identifies the ministry under which the Board operates.

Statement 2 is correct. The objectives listed accurately reflect the Board's mandates: infrastructure development for exports, quality and safety standards, and promotion of research on turmeric's health benefits.


**16. With reference to NABARD, consider the following statements:**

1.  Established in 1981, NABARD took over the agricultural credit functions of the State Bank of India (SBI) and the refinance functions of the Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC).
2.  NABARD, under the Ministry of Rural Development, primarily focuses on providing refinance to lending institutions in rural areas and strengthening Rural Cooperative Banks (RCBs), but not Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NABARD took over the agricultural credit functions of the *Reserve Bank of India* (RBI), not SBI, and the refinance functions of ARDC. The statement contains errors in identifying the entities from which NABARD inherited its functions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NABARD operates under the Ministry of Finance, not the Ministry of Rural Development. Furthermore, NABARD strengthens both RCBs and RRBs as part of its mandate to support rural financial institutions.  The statement is incorrect regarding both the ministry and the scope of its activities related to rural banks.


**17. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Rural Development, played a significant role in the Green Revolution by developing high-yielding crop varieties.
2. ICAR’s role in promoting climate-smart farming includes developing climate-resilient crop varieties, such as Rati ML 365 (rice) and BRG series pigeonpea, and promoting practices like rainwater harvesting and hydroponics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ICAR is an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The statement incorrectly identifies the ministry under which ICAR operates.

Statement 2 is correct. ICAR's efforts in promoting climate-smart agriculture include the development of climate-resilient crop varieties (like the ones mentioned) and the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices such as rainwater harvesting and hydroponics.


**18. With reference to Fintech in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's fintech ecosystem is the second-largest globally, with a 55% share of real-time transactions worldwide in 2022, and an 87% fintech adoption rate.
2.  Initiatives to promote fintech in India include the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), expansion of the scope of TReDS to include insurance companies, and the DIGIDHAN Mission under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's fintech ecosystem is the *third* largest globally, not the second.  India's share of real-time transactions in 2022 was 46%, not 55%. The statement provides incorrect figures for both the ranking and the share of real-time transactions.

Statement 2 is correct. The initiatives listed are accurately described as part of India's efforts to foster growth in the fintech sector.  ONDC, TReDS expansion, and the DIGIDHAN Mission are all key government programs aimed at supporting the fintech industry.


**19. With reference to the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  Issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the UCPMP 2024 mandates that information about drugs must be balanced, up-to-date, verifiable, and must not mislead, directly or indirectly.
2.  The UCPMP 2024 allows the use of brand names of other companies in promotional material without prior consent, provided the comparison is factual and fair.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UCPMP 2024 was issued by the Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The statement incorrectly identifies the issuing ministry.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UCPMP 2024 explicitly *prohibits* the use of brand names of other companies in promotional material without prior consent.  Comparisons must be factual, fair, and substantiated.  The statement misrepresents the code's provisions on brand name usage.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association primarily advocated for complete independence through armed revolution, with socialist ideals playing a secondary role in their ideology.
2.  Jawaharlal Nehru's socialist leanings were significantly influenced by Fabian Socialism, a gradualist approach to achieving socialist goals through parliamentary means.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Hindustan Republican Association did aim for complete independence through revolutionary means, socialist ideals were central to their ideology, influencing their methods and goals.  Their objective was not just independence but a socialist revolution in India.  They believed in a radical transformation of society, aligning closely with socialist principles.

Statement 2 is correct. Jawaharlal Nehru's socialist ideology was deeply shaped by Fabian Socialism, a British socialist movement that advocated for gradual social reform through existing political structures rather than violent revolution.  This influenced Nehru's approach to building a socialist state in India through democratic and planned means.  He didn't advocate for immediate revolutionary change but favoured a more gradual transition.  His vision was distinct from revolutionary socialist movements.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Preamble to the Indian Constitution, as originally adopted, explicitly mentioned the terms "socialist" and "secular," reflecting the prevailing consensus among the Constituent Assembly members.
2.  Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the right to form associations or unions, played a crucial role in the development and spread of socialist and secular movements in independent India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The original Preamble to the Indian Constitution did not include the words "socialist" and "secular." These terms were added later through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976, reflecting a shift in the political landscape and the government's policy direction. The original Preamble focused on the foundational principles of sovereignty, socialism, secularism and democracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 19(1)(g) does guarantee the right to form associations, its direct impact on the specific development and spread of socialist and secular movements in India is not a direct or primary causal factor.  Many other factors contributed to the rise of these movements, including socio-economic conditions, intellectual influences, and political mobilization. The article provided the legal framework for the formation of organizations but did not directly drive the ideological development of these movements.


**3. With reference to the individuals who contributed to the shaping of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  M.N. Roy, a prominent Marxist thinker, was the first to publicly advocate for the establishment of an Indian Constituent Assembly in 1940, significantly influencing the early discussions on the nation's future governance structure.
2.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the chairman of the Drafting Committee, solely authored the Objective Resolution, which served as the foundational document for the Preamble to the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While M.N. Roy was a significant figure in Indian political thought and advocated for socialist ideals,  attributing the first proposal for an Indian Constituent Assembly solely to him is inaccurate.  Several other individuals and groups were involved in advocating for a constituent assembly before 1940.  The idea gained momentum over time through various discussions and debates within the Indian National Congress and other political organizations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although Dr. B.R. Ambedkar played a pivotal role in drafting the Indian Constitution and the Objective Resolution significantly influenced the Preamble,  he did not solely author it.  The Objective Resolution was a product of collective deliberation within the Constituent Assembly, with contributions from several members, including Jawaharlal Nehru who moved it in the assembly.  Ambedkar's contributions were substantial, but the resolution was not his sole creation.


**4. With reference to the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 42nd Amendment Act added the words "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble, but it did not alter the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
2.  The 42nd Amendment Act introduced the concept of Fundamental Duties in the Constitution, placing obligations on citizens alongside their rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The 42nd Amendment Act did add "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble. However, it's crucial to note that while it didn't explicitly *remove* any fundamental rights, it did make some changes to them, notably by curbing the scope of judicial review in some areas.  This alteration to the balance between the judiciary and the legislature caused controversy and ultimately led to judicial review of this amendment.


Statement 2 is correct. The 42nd Amendment Act is indeed notable for introducing Fundamental Duties into the Constitution, aiming to create a balance between the rights and responsibilities of citizens.


**5. With reference to the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The PCMA, 2006, increased the minimum marriageable age for girls to 21 years, aligning it with the age for boys.
2. The PCMA, 2006, introduced stringent penalties for those involved in child marriages, including imprisonment and fines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PCMA, 2006, maintained the minimum marriageable age for girls at 18 years and for boys at 21 years.  While there have been subsequent discussions and debates about raising the marriageable age for girls to 21, the 2006 Act itself did not make this change.

Statement 2 is correct. The PCMA, 2006, significantly strengthened the legal framework against child marriage by introducing more robust penalties, including imprisonment and substantial fines for those involved in arranging or solemnizing such marriages.  The aim was to deter the practice more effectively than previous legislation.


**6. With reference to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCDRC is headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court of India, appointed by the President based on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India.
2. Appeals against the orders of the NCDRC can be directly filed in the Supreme Court of India, bypassing the High Courts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCDRC is headed by a person qualified to be appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court of India.  The President appoints the Chairperson based on the CJI's recommendation. Although the chairperson is a retired judge of the Supreme Court of India, the appointment is not automatic. The President appoints the chairperson based on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Appeals against NCDRC orders are made to the Supreme Court, but they are not directly filed.  The appeal route goes through the High Court first.  The process of appealing to the Supreme Court is not direct.



**7. With reference to the University Grants Commission (UGC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC is a statutory body established under the UGC Act, 1956,  and is responsible for maintaining standards in higher education across India.
2. The UGC directly disburses grants to all universities and colleges in India, ensuring equitable distribution of funds across the higher education sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UGC is indeed a statutory body established under the UGC Act, 1956.  Its primary function is to coordinate, determine and maintain standards of higher education.  It plays a vital role in setting academic standards, promoting quality education, and coordinating research.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UGC plays a significant role in the funding of higher education, it does not directly disburse grants to *all* universities and colleges.  The funding mechanisms are more complex, involving both central and state governments and various schemes. The UGC's role is primarily regulatory and standard-setting, not direct disbursement of funds to all institutions.  It primarily provides grants to those universities and colleges that meet certain criteria.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 provided for the establishment of Gram Sabhas in rural areas, granting them significant powers in local governance.
2.  The 74th Amendment Act of 1992 established Nagar Panchayats as the primary unit of local self-governance in urban areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act did establish Gram Sabhas, giving them a crucial role in local governance, particularly in participatory planning and decision-making in rural areas.  They are the village assemblies, which were granted the power to participate in local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 74th Amendment Act established Municipalities (and not Nagar Panchayats) as the primary units of local self-governance in urban areas. Nagar Panchayats are established to govern smaller urban areas and are not the primary unit of urban local governance.  Municipalities encompass a broader range of urban areas.


**9. With reference to the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's judgment in this case established the doctrine of basic structure, limiting the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.
2. The Kesavananda Bharati case primarily concerned the challenge to the government's acquisition of land under the Kerala Land Reforms Act of 1963.  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kesavananda Bharati case is indeed landmark for establishing the doctrine of basic structure, which limits Parliament's amending power by preventing the alteration or destruction of the fundamental features of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The case did involve a challenge to land acquisition under the Kerala Land Reforms Act, but the Supreme Court's ruling was more nuanced than simply upholding the constitutionality of the Act. The court's main focus was on the limits of amending power, and the land acquisition was the context within which this larger constitutional question was addressed. The Supreme Court did not uphold the constitutionality of the Act completely.


**10. With reference to Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 30 grants the right to establish and administer educational institutions only to religious minorities.
2.  The right guaranteed under Article 30 is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the state in the interests of public order, morality, and health.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 30 grants the right to establish and administer educational institutions to both religious and linguistic minorities.  The scope of the article is broader than just religious minorities.

Statement 2 is correct.  While Article 30 guarantees a fundamental right, this right is not absolute.  The state can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right to protect public order, morality, and health.  The article's provisions are subject to reasonable restrictions.


**11. Consider the following statements:**

1. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, primarily dealt with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India.
2. The Anti-Defection Law, which aims to prevent defections in the legislature, was introduced through a Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, dealt with cooperative societies, granting them constitutional status. The GST was introduced through a different amendment, the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The Anti-Defection Law, officially known as the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution, was indeed introduced through a Constitutional Amendment Act (52nd Amendment Act). It aims to curb political defections and maintain the stability of governments.  The Tenth Schedule was added to the Constitution through the 52nd Amendment Act.


**12. With reference to the Preamble to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preamble declares India to be a "Socialist Republic", reflecting the commitment to a society based on social and economic equality.
2. The Preamble guarantees "Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship" as a fundamental right, protected by the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Preamble does declare India a "Socialist Republic," reflecting the commitment to social and economic justice.  The term "socialist" indicates the aim of a more equitable society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Preamble reflects the spirit of liberty, it does not itself *guarantee* any specific fundamental rights.  Fundamental Rights are explicitly listed in Part III of the Constitution.  The Preamble, though aspirational and foundational, does not contain the list of guaranteed rights.  The fundamental rights are listed in Part III of the Constitution.  The Preamble describes the aims and objectives but does not guarantee the rights.


**13. Consider the following statements:**

1. The term "Secular" was added to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution by the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978.
2.  The concept of Secularism, as enshrined in the Indian Constitution, is characterized by the State's neutrality towards religion, ensuring freedom of religion for all citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The term "Secular" was added to the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976.  This was a significant change that further solidified the concept of secularism within the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Constitution's concept of secularism means the state remains neutral toward religion, guaranteeing freedom of religion for all citizens.  It promotes religious tolerance and equality.  The concept of secularism in India is unique and distinct from the Western concept of secularism.  The state does not promote any particular religion.


**14. With reference to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, consider the following statements:**

1. These amendments introduced the concept of three-tier Panchayati Raj system at the village, intermediate, and district levels.
2. These amendments mandated the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women in both Panchayats and Municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 73rd and 74th Amendments aimed to establish a three-tier Panchayati Raj system at the village, intermediate (block/taluk/mandal), and district levels, strengthening local self-governance. The three-tier Panchayati Raj system was introduced to enhance local governance.

Statement 2 is correct.  Both the 73rd and 74th Amendments mandated seat reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women in Panchayats and Municipalities respectively, ensuring their representation in local governance.  The reservation of seats was implemented to ensure representation of marginalized communities.  The reservation is based on the population of SCs, STs and women.


**15. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly defines the term "Scheduled Tribe" and provides a comprehensive list of communities included within this category.
2. Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was repealed in 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not provide a comprehensive list of communities that constitute the Scheduled Tribes. The identification and inclusion of communities in the Scheduled Tribe category is done by the President through notifications based on the recommendations of the state governments.  The identification of Scheduled Tribes is a complex process based on various factors.  The President issues notifications based on the recommendations of the state governments.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was indeed repealed by the Indian government in 2019.  This was a significant constitutional change.  The decision to repeal Article 370 was taken by the Indian government in 2019.  The government cited various reasons for this decision.


**16. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 368 of the Indian Constitution solely deals with the procedure for amending the Constitution, without any limitations or restrictions on the scope of amendments.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has played a crucial role in interpreting the Constitution, including defining the limits of the amending power under Article 368.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 368 outlines the procedure for constitutional amendments, but it is not without limitations.  The Supreme Court's judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case established the doctrine of basic structure, which restricts the scope of amendments, preventing the alteration or destruction of the essential features of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court has indeed played a vital role in interpreting and shaping the Constitution. It has not only interpreted the provisions of the Constitution but also provided a judicial review on the amendments made to the Constitution.  The Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 368, particularly in relation to the basic structure doctrine, has significantly influenced the understanding and application of the amendment process.  It has established the doctrine of basic structure to limit the power of the Parliament.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is appointed for a term of eight years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2.  The CAG's office is established under Article 148 of the Indian Constitution and audits the receipts and expenditure of both the central and state governments, including substantially government-funded bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's term is six years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier, not eight years. This is a crucial detail often missed, making it a good distractor in a UPSC-style question. The difference between six and eight years is significant and shows the need for precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 148 of the Indian Constitution indeed establishes the CAG's office. The CAG's auditing responsibilities encompass both central and state government finances, extending to entities substantially financed by the government. This reflects a core constitutional function and demonstrates an understanding of the CAG's role in maintaining financial accountability and transparency.  The inclusion of "substantially government-funded bodies" adds complexity, requiring a deeper understanding than a superficial knowledge of the CAG's role.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1.


**2. With reference to the Press Council of India (PCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PCI's decisions are subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court of India.
2.  The PCI was established under the Indian Press Council Act, 1965, and commenced operations in 1966; it was dissolved during the Emergency but later re-established.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A key aspect of the PCI's constitution is that its decisions are final and cannot be challenged in any court. This quasi-judicial power is a significant feature distinguishing it from other regulatory bodies.  Presenting this as challengeable creates a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the PCI's authority.

Statement 2 is correct. The PCI's establishment under the 1965 Act and its commencement in 1966, along with its dissolution during the Emergency and subsequent re-establishment, are accurately described. This demonstrates an understanding of the PCI's historical context and its resilience in upholding press freedom.  The inclusion of the Emergency period detail increases the question's difficulty, requiring more than a basic understanding of the PCI's formation. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the misconception regarding the finality of PCI decisions.



**3. With reference to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee comprises 21 members from the Rajya Sabha and 10 from the Lok Sabha.
2. The Chairperson of the Committee is appointed by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from amongst its members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The correct composition is 21 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha, a common point of confusion as the numbers are close and easily interchanged. This highlights the necessity of precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha indeed appoints the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence. This reflects the Lok Sabha's dominance in the appointment process within the parliamentary system. The straightforwardness of this statement contrasts with the misleading information in statement 1, increasing the question's difficulty.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the error in statement 1.


**4. With reference to the Delimitation Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission includes retired judges from the High Courts, the Chief Election Commissioner, and respective State Election Commissioners.
2. The Commission's primary function is to determine the number and boundaries of constituencies to ensure, as far as practicable, equal population across all seats, identifying seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Commission includes a retired Supreme Court judge (not High Court judges) as its Chairperson, along with the Chief Election Commissioner and State Election Commissioners. This subtle difference in judicial level is a common source of error, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the Commission's composition.

Statement 2 is correct. The Delimitation Commission's core functions accurately reflect its constitutional mandate.  The inclusion of the phrase "as far as practicable" indicates a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in achieving perfectly equal population distribution. The mention of reserved seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes adds further depth. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the error in statement 1.


**5.  Consider the following statements:**

1. Section 479 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) mandates the release of all undertrials who have spent more than half their maximum sentence before Constitution Day.
2.  The BNSS replaced Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC), maintaining a similar standard for the release of undertrials based on the fraction of their maximum sentence served.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Section 479 of the BNSS allows for the release of *first-time* offenders who have served one-third of their maximum sentence and *other* undertrials who have served half their maximum sentence.  The statement incorrectly simplifies the criteria and adds a time-sensitive element (Constitution Day) not present in the law. This is a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the legal provision.

Statement 2 is correct. The BNSS did indeed replace Section 436A of the CrPC, maintaining a similar framework for undertrial release.  This demonstrates an understanding of the continuity of legal principles despite changes in legislation.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1's description of Section 479.


**6. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG can be removed from office by the President of India on the same grounds and in the same manner as a judge of a High Court.
2. The CAG heads the Indian Audit and Accounts Department and enjoys the same status as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court of India in order of precedence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CAG can be removed by the President on the same grounds and in the same manner as a Supreme Court judge, not a High Court judge. This difference in the level of court involved is a common point of confusion, testing the candidate's knowledge of the precise legal procedure.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG's position as head of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department and their equivalent status to a Supreme Court judge in precedence are accurate. This reflects the CAG's high constitutional standing and importance in India's governance structure.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the error in statement 1.



**7. With reference to the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), consider the following statements:**

1. CARA is a non-statutory body under the Ministry of Women and Child Development that regulates both in-country and inter-country adoptions.
2. CARA adheres to the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption, 1993, ratified by India in 2003, prioritizing the best interests of children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CARA is a *statutory* body, not a non-statutory one.  This seemingly minor detail is crucial for understanding CARA's legal standing and authority.  The error creates a compelling distractor for candidates who may have a general understanding of CARA but lack precise knowledge of its legal status.

Statement 2 is correct. CARA's adherence to the Hague Convention and its prioritization of children's best interests are accurately stated. This demonstrates an understanding of the international framework governing inter-country adoptions and CARA's role in ethical adoption practices.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the error in statement 1 regarding CARA's statutory status.


**8. With reference to the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendment added the words "socialist" and "secular" to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, but not "integrity".
2.  The amendment introduced significant changes to the Constitution's Basic Structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Baltic Sea, being the world's largest expanse of brackish water, exhibits a unique semi-enclosed nature and relatively shallow depth, influencing its unique ecosystem.
2.  The Baltic Sea's connection to the North Sea via the Kiel Canal significantly impacts its salinity levels, resulting in a lower salinity than the open ocean.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Baltic Sea is indeed characterized by its brackish water (a mixture of freshwater and saltwater), its semi-enclosed nature (partially surrounded by land), and its relatively shallow depth. These factors combine to create a unique marine environment distinct from the open ocean, influencing its biodiversity and susceptibility to pollution.  The semi-enclosed nature limits water exchange, affecting salinity and nutrient cycles. The shallow depth allows for greater sunlight penetration, influencing primary productivity.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Kiel Canal artificially connects the Baltic Sea to the North Sea.  While this improves navigation, it also affects the Baltic's hydrological characteristics, primarily its salinity. The influx of higher salinity water from the North Sea is comparatively less than the freshwater inflow from rivers, leading to the Baltic Sea's overall lower salinity compared to the open ocean. This lower salinity is a crucial defining feature of the Baltic Sea ecosystem.  The impact on salinity is a complex interplay of factors, including water inflow from rivers and outflow through the Danish Straits, but the Kiel Canal plays a significant role in modifying the salinity balance.


**2. With reference to the geographical features of the Baltic Sea, consider the following statements:**

1. OPEC+ comprises exclusively of member states of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), working to maximize global oil production.
2.  OPEC+ includes both OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, aiming to stabilize oil markets through coordinated production adjustments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. OPEC+ is not limited to OPEC members alone; it explicitly includes significant non-OPEC oil-producing nations.  The inclusion of these non-OPEC members is a defining feature of the group, aiming for broader market influence and coordination. The primary goal is not to maximize global oil production, but rather to stabilize oil markets through production agreements.

Statement 2 is correct. OPEC+ is a coalition of both OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, established to enhance cooperation and coordinate production policies to stabilize oil prices and supply. The inclusion of non-OPEC members significantly expands the group's influence on the global oil market, allowing it to influence production levels more effectively than OPEC alone.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IWT was not brokered by the IMF; it was brokered by the World Bank.  Furthermore, the treaty does *not* allocate all the waters of the Indus River system to India.  It establishes a framework for the equitable sharing of these waters between India and Pakistan.

Statement 2 is correct. The IWT, signed in 1960, does indeed allocate the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej) to India for unrestricted use.  The western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab) are primarily allocated to Pakistan, with specific provisions regarding India's limited use for certain purposes.  This unequal allocation is a key feature of the treaty and has been a source of tension between the two countries.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Minamata Convention on Mercury, adopted in Geneva, mandates the complete phase-out of mercury use in all industrial sectors globally by 2020.
2. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, also adopted in Geneva, prohibits all forms of harmful fishing subsidies, including those that contribute to overfishing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Minamata Convention on Mercury was indeed adopted in Geneva and aims to reduce and eventually eliminate mercury use, the complete phase-out across all sectors by 2020 is an oversimplification. The convention sets different timelines and approaches for various sectors and applications of mercury, with some exemptions and allowances for specific circumstances.  The phased approach recognizes the complexities of transitioning away from mercury and the need for a realistic timetable that considers national capabilities and technological feasibility.  The 2020 deadline applies to certain specific applications, not a complete global ban.

Statement 2 is correct. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, adopted in Geneva, specifically targets harmful fishing subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. The agreement prohibits certain practices and provides for the phasing out of others, aiming to promote sustainable fishing practices and protect marine resources.  It's a significant step toward regulating the global fishing industry and addressing issues of sustainability, resource depletion, and unfair competition.


**2. With reference to India's trade relations with Rome during the ancient period, consider the following statements:**

1.  India primarily exported spices, textiles, and precious stones to Rome, while importing mainly manufactured goods like glassware and pottery.
2. The flourishing trade between India and Rome led to significant gold accumulation in India, contributing substantially to its economic prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ancient India engaged in extensive trade with Rome, exporting a wide range of goods, including spices (pepper, cardamom, etc.), fine textiles (muslin, silk), and precious stones (pearls, jewels).  Rome, in turn, supplied manufactured goods like glassware and pottery, but the trade balance was heavily tilted towards India due to the high demand for Indian commodities.  The Roman appetite for luxury goods from the East substantially fueled India's export-oriented economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The significant flow of trade was indeed in India's favor, but the resultant accumulation of gold was primarily in Rome, not India.  India exported goods, while Rome paid primarily in gold and silver. This massive outflow of precious metals from Rome to pay for luxury goods from the East has been noted by historians as a key factor in the decline of the Roman economy.  The economic benefit for India was primarily through the increased demand for its products and the consequent boost in its economy, not through a net accumulation of Roman gold.


**3. With reference to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), consider the following statements:**

1. EFTA's primary objective, established in 1960, was to promote free trade and economic integration amongst its member states, initially comprising seven countries.
2.  Currently, EFTA includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) was indeed established in 1960 with the initial aim of fostering free trade and economic cooperation among its member states.  It started with seven member countries and aimed to create a free trade area, removing tariffs and other trade barriers between them.  The formation of EFTA was partly a response to the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), now the European Union (EU), offering an alternative model of regional economic integration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland are current members of EFTA, the United Kingdom is not. The UK was a member of EFTA  before joining the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973 and left the EU in 2020. It has not rejoined EFTA.  Therefore, the list of current EFTA members provided in statement 2 is incomplete and inaccurate.


**4.  With reference to India's relations with Bangladesh, consider the following statements:**

2.  Factors considered for granting permanent remission include the nature of the offence, the possibility of future criminal behavior, and the socio-economic conditions of the convict's family.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UN, through various agencies like UNICEF and UNFPA, collects and publishes data on demographic indicators, including sex ratios. While the precise numbers might fluctuate slightly depending on the data source and year, the statement reflects the general trend of a global disparity in sex ratios, with some countries exhibiting significantly skewed ratios.

Statement 2 is correct. The UN, through its various agencies and programs, supports numerous initiatives aimed at sustainable development. The Spring Initiative, while not explicitly a major UN program, is an example of the type of project that aligns with the UN's broader development goals and might receive UN support or collaboration.  The focus on sustainable development is a core tenet of the UN's mission.


**6.  With reference to the  UNFCCC COP28, consider the following statements:**

1.  The operationalized Loss and Damage (L&D) Fund, first announced at COP27, will be administered by an independent secretariat under the World Bank for an initial four-year period.
2. India signed the COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate and Health, which was released in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and signed by over 120 countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Loss and Damage Fund's structure, as described, accurately reflects the agreement reached at COP28. The World Bank's role as an interim host and the existence of an independent secretariat are key features of the fund's operationalization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that India had *not* signed the COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate and Health at the time of the report.  International agreements and declarations often require ratification or signature by participating countries.  The fact that many other countries signed it doesn't automatically mean India did.



**7. With reference to  Norway, consider the following statements:**

1.  Norway's Parliament issued an unreserved apology for its past assimilation policies towards the Sami, Kven, and Forest Finn peoples, following a report by the Truth and Reconciliation Committee.
2. Norway is a member of the G7 climate club, an initiative to accelerate climate action and increase ambition to achieve global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage explicitly mentions Norway's parliamentary apology for its historical assimilation policies.  This reflects a significant development in Norway's relationship with its indigenous populations and commitment to reconciliation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage clearly states that the G7 climate club does *not* include India as a member and that India is not a member. Norway's membership in this particular club is not mentioned in the text, and the statement is a false assertion.  While Norway is known for its climate action initiatives, its participation in the specific G7 climate club needs to be verified from other sources.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1. The award was instituted in 1969, coinciding with the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke.
2.  Recipients of the award receive a Swarna Kamal, a cash prize, and a shawl.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is named after Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema,  it was instituted in 1969,  but this was not necessarily coinciding with his birth centenary. His birth centenary was in fact a few years prior to 1969. The award's establishment aimed to recognize lifetime achievements in Indian cinema, not specifically tied to Phalke's birth anniversary.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award does indeed include a Swarna Kamal (Golden Lotus) and a shawl, but it does *not* include a significant cash prize.  The monetary component, if any, is minimal and not a central feature of the award. The primary recognition lies in the prestigious nature of the award itself, celebrating a lifetime's contribution to Indian cinema.  The emphasis is on honouring the recipient's contribution to the art form rather than financial reward.


**2. With reference to Lal Bahadur Shastri, consider the following statements:**

1. He served as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh before becoming Prime Minister of India.
2.  He is known for his policy of "Garibi Hatao," aimed at poverty eradication.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Lal Bahadur Shastri held various ministerial portfolios in the Uttar Pradesh government, but he was never the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.  He rose through the ranks of the Indian National Congress to eventually become Prime Minister of India.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The slogan "Garibi Hatao" (Eradicate Poverty) is strongly associated with Indira Gandhi's political campaigns and policies, particularly during her 1971 election campaign. While Shastri was concerned with poverty alleviation,  "Garibi Hatao" is not a slogan or policy directly linked to his tenure.  His focus was more on national unity, economic stability, and international relations, especially during the 1965 Indo-Pak war.


**3. With reference to the Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh (BAJSS), consider the following statements:**

1.  Thakkar Bapa, its founder, significantly contributed to the Compulsory Primary Education Bill in the Bombay Legislative Council.
2.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad served as the Founder-President of BAJSS, actively shaping its initial direction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Amritlal Vithaldas Thakkar, popularly known as Thakkar Bapa, was indeed the founder of the BAJSS (Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh) in 1948. His work extended beyond the organization; he played a crucial role in advocating for primary education, including his involvement in presenting the Compulsory Primary Education Bill in the Bombay Legislative Council in 1918. This shows his broader commitment to social reform and upliftment of marginalized communities, which aligns with BAJSS's goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Dr. Rajendra Prasad was a highly respected figure and played a significant role in India's freedom struggle and post-independence nation-building, he was not the Founder-President of BAJSS.  The organization was founded and initially led by Thakkar Bapa.  Dr. Prasad's contributions might have come later through support or patronage, but not at the founding stage.


**4.  With reference to the  Dudhwa National Park, consider the following statements:**

1.  Located in Uttar Pradesh, it is primarily known for its large population of one-horned rhinoceroses.
2. The park's diverse ecosystem supports a significant population of Bengal tigers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dudhwa National Park, situated in Uttar Pradesh, is indeed renowned for its rich biodiversity. However, it is not primarily known for its one-horned rhinoceros population.  While rhinos are present, their numbers are relatively smaller compared to other species like tigers.  The park's significance lies more in its tiger population and its role in protecting the Terai region's unique ecosystem.

Statement 2 is correct.  Dudhwa National Park is recognized as an important tiger habitat and holds a significant population of Bengal tigers. The park's location in the Terai region provides a suitable environment for these animals, making it crucial for tiger conservation efforts in India. The park's management actively works towards protecting the tiger population and its prey base.


**5. With reference to the  "Battle of Walong," consider the following statements:**

1. It was a decisive battle fought during the 1962 Sino-Indian War, resulting in a significant Indian victory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Walong, part of the 1962 Sino-Indian War, was a significant engagement. However, it did not result in a decisive Indian victory. While the Indian forces put up a strong defense, they eventually retreated, and the battle is considered a Chinese tactical victory.  The outcome of the battle was not a turning point in the overall war, and it ended with Chinese control of the Walong region.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Walong, although ultimately a retreat for India, is remembered for the valiant defense by the Indian troops.  They employed guerilla warfare tactics, utilizing the terrain to their advantage, demonstrating resilience and tactical flexibility in the face of a superior enemy force.  This showcases the potential of such tactics in asymmetric warfare.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the Pali language:**

1. Pali is one of the classical languages of India officially recognized by the Government of India.
2. The Tripitaka, the sacred canon of Buddhism, is primarily written in Pali.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Pali is an important language with a rich literary tradition, particularly associated with Buddhism, it is *not* currently listed among the classical languages of India officially recognized by the Government of India.  The list of classical languages includes languages like Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, and Sanskrit.  The criteria for classifying a language as "classical" are stringent and involve factors like antiquity, significant literary tradition, and cultural influence. Pali, while ancient and influential, may not fully meet all these criteria according to the Indian government's definition.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Tripitaka, the most important canonical collection of Buddhist texts, is indeed primarily written in Pali. It comprises three sections: Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka.  Pali served as a crucial language for the preservation and transmission of Buddhist teachings across various regions.


**7. With reference to Raja Ravi Varma, consider the following statements:**

1. He primarily used oil paints in his works, creating large-scale canvases depicting scenes from the Ramayana.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Raja Ravi Varma did depict scenes from the Ramayana and other Indian epics, and created large-scale works, he did *not* primarily use oil paints.  He primarily used watercolors, which are easier to work with and produce bright colors. Oil painting was not his dominant medium though he may have used it occasionally.

Statement 2 is correct. Raja Ravi Varma is indeed credited with significantly popularizing lithography in India. By using this printing technique, his artwork could be reproduced and distributed widely, making it accessible to a much larger audience than was previously possible for traditional paintings. This greatly increased the reach of Indian art and contributed to his widespread fame.  His use of lithography is a significant factor in his legacy.


**8. With reference to the  Doddalathur Megalithic Site, consider the following statements:**

1. Situated in Karnataka, this site primarily comprises burial structures, dating back to the Iron Age.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Doddalathur megalithic site in Karnataka's Chamarajanagar district is indeed known for its megalithic structures, which are primarily associated with burial practices. The site is considered significant for understanding funerary rituals and social structures of the Iron Age in the region.  The presence of various types of megalithic monuments indicates a complex and possibly stratified society.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) did discover and document the Doddalathur megalithic site in 1961.  The ASI's work involved systematic excavation and study of the site, leading to a greater understanding of the site's historical significance. The discovery and subsequent research have enriched knowledge of the region's prehistory.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mera Hou Chongba Festival, celebrated in Manipur, is indeed a significant cultural event.  It is closely linked to the worship of Lord Krishna, reflecting the influence of Vaishnavism in the region. The festival's rituals and celebrations are deeply rooted in religious traditions and local beliefs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Manipur is known for its rich water-based cultural activities, particularly on Loktak Lake, these are not directly part of the Mera Hou Chongba Festival.  The festival's main focus is on the religious aspects associated with Lord Krishna.  The boat races and water-based activities are features of other Manipuri festivals.

1. He authored the book "Tribes of India," a seminal work on Indian tribal communities.
2. He was instrumental in establishing the  Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh (BAJSS) in 1918.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Thakkar Bapa's contributions to understanding and advocating for the rights of Indian tribal communities are well documented. He did not, however, author the book "Tribes of India."  He was a significant social worker who dedicated his life to the welfare of tribal populations.  His deep involvement with these communities gave him a profound understanding of their lives, needs, and challenges.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Thakkar Bapa was the founder of the Bharatiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh (BAJSS), the organization was not established in 1918.  The BAJSS was founded much later, in 1948. His advocacy for tribal rights began much earlier, however, and he was involved in various initiatives before the BAJSS's founding.


**11.  With reference to  Brahmi inscriptions, consider the following statements:**

1.  These inscriptions are primarily written in Sanskrit, reflecting the language's dominance in ancient India.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sanskrit was an important language in ancient India, Brahmi inscriptions were not primarily written in Sanskrit. Early Brahmi inscriptions used various Prakrits and other regional languages.  The use of Sanskrit increased later in the historical period. The language used in the inscriptions varied based on the region and the period.

Statement 2 is correct. The Brahmi script is indeed a crucial ancestor of many modern Indian scripts.  Its evolution and adaptation across different regions led to the development of diverse writing systems, including Devanagari (used for Hindi and Sanskrit), Tamil, and several others.  The Brahmi script's influence on the development of Indian writing systems is undeniable.


**12. With reference to the Najdi architectural style, consider the following statements:**

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Najdi architectural style, while possessing its own distinct characteristics, is not defined by extensive ornate decorations and elaborate carvings.  It is instead characterized by a more functional and austere aesthetic, reflecting the local environment and available materials.  The focus is on practicality and adaptation to the climate, rather than lavish ornamentation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Najdi architectural style is predominantly found in Saudi Arabia, and its defining feature is the use of locally available materials such as mud-brick and wood.  This reflects a sustainable and regionally specific approach to architecture, adapted to the climatic conditions and resources of the Najd region.  The use of these materials is a key element distinguishing this architectural style.


**13. With reference to  Sohrai Painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  This traditional art form is primarily associated with the Telangana region of India.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

The art's connection to a specific region is important for understanding its cultural context and development.

Statement 2 is correct. Sohrai paintings are indeed characterized by the use of natural pigments and earthy colors.  The themes depicted often draw inspiration from daily rural life, agricultural activities, and mythological narratives.  The use of natural materials reflects a connection to the environment and traditional practices.

It recognizes outstanding contributions to Indian literature across various languages. The award's establishment aimed to promote literary excellence and recognize the contributions of writers in different Indian languages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Jnanpith Award primarily recognizes works in Indian languages, the eligibility is not strictly limited to the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.  It also includes English and other significant Indian languages.  The award's broad scope recognizes the diversity of Indian literature.

(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pakke Paga Hornbill Festival (PPHF), held in Arunachal Pradesh, is indeed associated with Pakke Tiger Reserve. However, its primary focus is not on tourism promotion.  The festival's main goal is to raise awareness about wildlife conservation and the importance of protecting hornbills, a species facing threats in the region.  Tourism might be a secondary benefit, but conservation is the central theme.

Statement 2 is correct. The Nyishi tribe, the largest tribe in Arunachal Pradesh, has historically engaged in hornbill hunting. However, the PPHF highlights their shift towards hornbill conservation. The festival recognizes their role in protecting hornbills within Pakke Tiger Reserve, showcasing a successful transition from hunting to conservation practices. This transformation is a significant aspect of the festival.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kittur Revolt, led by Rani Chennamma, was a significant rebellion against the British East India Company.  A primary reason for the revolt was the British government's application of the Doctrine of Lapse to Kittur, which aimed to annex the state due to the lack of a direct male heir.  This policy of annexation was a major source of discontent among Indian rulers.

Statement 2 is also correct.  To maintain the royal lineage and prevent the annexation of Kittur under the Doctrine of Lapse, Rani Chennamma adopted Shivalingappa as her heir. However, the British East India Company refused to recognize him, leading to further tensions and eventually triggering the revolt.  The British's refusal to acknowledge the adoption was a key factor that escalated the conflict.

Maulana Abul Kalam Azad held significant positions in the Indian government, including the crucial portfolio of Education Minister, but he was not the Prime Minister.  Nehru's leadership was central to the early years of independent India.

Statement 2 is correct.  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was instrumental in establishing the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) in 1950.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sir Syed Ahmad Khan wrote extensively on various issues related to Indian society and politics, he did *not* author "The Causes of the Indian Mutiny."  The authorship of this book is attributed to different individuals, depending on the specific edition or translation.  Many accounts of the 1857 revolt were written from various perspectives.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  "Satyarth Prakash," authored by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, is a seminal work in the Arya Samaj movement.  It is not primarily focused on critiquing the British colonial administration.  While colonial rule and its impact on Indian society might be mentioned, the main focus is on religious and social reform within Hinduism.

Statement 2 is correct.  "Satyarth Prakash" strongly advocates for a return to what it presents as the original Vedic principles of Hinduism. It criticizes various social and religious practices that it considers deviations from these principles, including idolatry, caste system and other aspects.  The book's core message is about reforming Hindu society based on its interpretation of Vedic scriptures.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Mahatma Gandhi did indeed found the "Young India" newspaper as a platform to express his views on Indian politics, social issues, and his philosophy of Satyagraha. The newspaper played a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing support for the Indian independence movement.  Gandhi used the newspaper to reach a wide audience.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Annie Besant was a prominent figure in Indian nationalism and ran her own newspaper, "New India," she was not associated with the editorship of "Young India" during its most influential period.  Gandhi himself was the editor and primary voice behind "Young India."


**23. Consider the following statements about  classical languages in India:**

1.  Marathi and Bengali are among the classical languages officially recognized by the Indian government.
2.  Prakrit is considered a classical language, reflecting its historical importance in Indian literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Marathi and Bengali are prominent and historically significant languages of India, they are *not* among the classical languages officially recognized by the Indian government.  The criteria for recognizing a language as "classical" involve its antiquity, its significant literary tradition, and its continued cultural influence.  While Marathi and Bengali have rich literary traditions, they haven't been officially designated as classical languages.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Prakrit, while historically important as a language spoken alongside Sanskrit and influencing many modern Indian languages, is not considered a classical language by the Indian government.  The "classical" designation has been given to languages that meet specific criteria regarding their ancient literary traditions and cultural impact.  Prakrit, though influential, does not meet the criteria for the classical language status.


**24. With reference to the  Cheriyal Scroll Painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  This art form is unique to the state of Chhattisgarh, reflecting its distinct cultural heritage.
2.  The paintings are characterized by a predominantly red background and depict mythological scenes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cheriyal Scroll Painting is *not* unique to Chhattisgarh. It originates in Telangana, and the art form is strongly tied to the cultural traditions of that region.  The scroll paintings' unique style and themes are closely linked to the specific artistic traditions of Telangana.

Statement 2 is correct. Cheriyal Scroll Paintings are indeed characterized by a predominantly red background.  The paintings usually depict scenes from Indian mythology, especially the epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and other stories from the Puranas.  The use of red as a dominant background color and the mythological themes are key features of the art.


**25.  With reference to the  "Causes of the Indian Mutiny" and "Asar-us-Sanadid," consider the following statements:**

1. Both books were authored by  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, presenting different perspectives on the 1857 revolt.
2. "Asar-us-Sanadid" is a historical work that provides insights into the socio-political conditions of 19th-century India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad is known for his significant contributions to Indian nationalism and his writings on various aspects of Indian history and politics, but he did not author both "The Causes of the Indian Mutiny" and "Asar-us-Sanadid." These books have different authors.  "The Causes of the Indian Mutiny" has multiple authors depending on the version, and "Asar-us-Sanadid" was written by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan.

Statement 2 is correct. "Asar-us-Sanadid," authored by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, is indeed a valuable historical work that provides insights into the socio-political conditions of 19th-century India, particularly from the perspective of the Muslim community.  The book's historical analysis offers valuable insights into that era's social and political dynamics.


**26. With reference to  the  "Battle of Plassey," consider the following statements:**

1.  Fought in 1757, it marked the beginning of British dominance in the Carnatic region of South India.
2. Mir Jafar's betrayal of Siraj ud-Daulah played a crucial role in the British victory.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Plassey, fought in 1757, was a pivotal event in the establishment of British power in India. However, it primarily marked the beginning of British dominance in Bengal, not the Carnatic region. The Carnatic Wars were a series of conflicts that took place earlier, and the Battle of Plassey had a more direct impact on Bengal and its surrounding areas.

Statement 2 is correct. Mir Jafar's defection from Siraj ud-Daulah's side and his subsequent alliance with the British played a decisive role in the British victory at Plassey.  Mir Jafar's betrayal significantly weakened Siraj ud-Daulah's forces, contributing to the British East India Company's triumph.  The Battle of Plassey is often analyzed in terms of the impact of this betrayal on the outcome of the war.


**27. Consider the following statements regarding the  "Doctrine of Lapse":**

1.  Introduced by Lord Dalhousie, this policy led to the annexation of several Indian states during the British Raj.
2.  The policy was based on the principle that if an Indian ruler died without a natural male heir, his state would automatically revert to the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India, introduced the "Doctrine of Lapse" policy.  This policy was used by the British East India Company to annex several Indian princely states during the mid-19th century.  The annexation of these states significantly expanded British control over India. The Doctrine of Lapse is a controversial aspect of British rule in India and is often studied in the context of British expansionism.

Statement 2 is also correct. The core principle of the Doctrine of Lapse was that if an Indian ruler died without a natural male heir, the state would be annexed by the British. This led to widespread resentment among Indian rulers who feared the loss of their sovereignty.  The policy is often seen as a significant factor contributing to the growing tensions between the British and Indian rulers.



**28. With reference to  the  "Salt Satyagraha," consider the following statements:**

1.  It was launched in 1930, challenging the British government's monopoly over salt production.
2.  The march to Dandi was a symbolic act of defiance against British rule and attracted widespread participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Salt Satyagraha, a major event in the Indian independence movement, was indeed launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930. The campaign aimed to challenge the British government's salt tax and its monopoly over salt production, a basic necessity for the Indian population.  The salt tax was a particularly oppressive measure.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Dandi March, a key part of the Salt Satyagraha, was a symbolic act of civil disobedience. The march to Dandi, where Gandhi and his followers made salt in defiance of the British law, attracted widespread participation from various sections of Indian society.  The march became a powerful symbol of resistance against colonial rule.


**29. Consider the following statements regarding the  "Quit India Movement":**

1.  Launched in 1942, it called for the immediate end of British rule in India.
2.  The movement was entirely non-violent, with no instances of clashes between Indian protestors and British forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quit India Movement, launched in 1942, was a mass civil disobedience campaign aimed at securing India's independence from British rule.  The movement's call for immediate independence was a powerful expression of Indian nationalism.  The movement was a watershed moment in the Indian independence struggle.

Statement 

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided information, adhering to the specified criteria.  Note that due to the vastness of the provided text, creating a comprehensive set of questions within the token limit is challenging.  The following questions focus on key aspects and aim for a diverse range of difficulty levels.


**1. With reference to the Konark Sun Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  The temple's construction utilized chlorite, laterite, and khondalite rocks, showcasing advanced stone-working techniques of the era.
2.  The iconic Konark Wheels, a prominent architectural feature, were initially showcased at the G20 summit to highlight India's rich cultural heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Konark Sun Temple's construction demonstrates a high level of architectural and engineering skill for its time. The use of chlorite, laterite, and khondalite rocks, along with intricate carvings, reflects the advanced technological capabilities and artistic sensibilities of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.  The specific rock types highlight the local resources utilized, a common theme in ancient Indian architecture.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Konark Sun Temple is a significant historical site in its own right, the mention of its showcase at the G20 summit highlights the temple's contemporary relevance. The G20 summit provided a platform to showcase India's cultural heritage to a global audience, emphasizing the enduring value and international recognition of the Konark Sun Temple.  This act signifies the temple's continued importance in national identity and its role in modern diplomacy.


**2. With reference to Raigad Fort, consider the following statements:**

1.  British historians labeled Raigad Fort the "Gibraltar of the East" primarily due to its unique architectural style, resembling the Gibraltar rock formation.
2.  The fort's strategic coastal location facilitated its significant role in international trade during the Maratha rule, contributing to the kingdom's economic prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the strong fortifications of Raigad Fort are a key reason for its historical significance, the British appellation of "Gibraltar of the East" is primarily attributed to its formidable defensive capabilities and strategic location, not its architectural similarity to Gibraltar.  The comparison emphasizes the impregnability of the fort, a crucial aspect of military strategy.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Raigad Fort's strategic importance was primarily military and administrative. While Maratha rule saw significant economic activity, the fort's coastal location wasn't its primary contributor to international trade.  Major port cities were more central to Maratha trade networks. The fort served as a capital and military stronghold, not a major commercial hub.


**3. With reference to the Kumbh Mela, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kumbh Mela's rotating locations include Rishikesh, Ujjain, Puri, and Prayagraj, reflecting the diverse geographical spread of Hindu pilgrimage sites across India.
2.  UNESCO's recognition of the Kumbh Mela as an Intangible Cultural Heritage underscores its significance in Hindu mythology, specifically its connection to the Samudra Manthan (Churning of the Ocean) narrative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Prayagraj, Ujjain, and Haridwar (not Rishikesh, which is associated with a smaller, related mela) are indeed locations for the Kumbh Mela, Puri is not.  The four main locations represent the confluence of sacred rivers associated with Hindu mythology and cosmology. The inclusion of Rishikesh is a common misconception, as it hosts a separate Kumbh Mela.

Statement 2 is correct.  UNESCO's recognition of the Kumbh Mela emphasizes its cultural significance extending beyond a mere religious gathering. The event's roots in Hindu mythology, particularly its linkage to the Samudra Manthan, provide a deeper understanding of its cultural and historical context.  This recognition highlights the event's global importance and its contribution to India's cultural landscape.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1. The award, presented annually at the National Film Awards ceremony, includes a cash prize of ₹100 Lakhs and a Swarna Kamal (Golden Lotus).
2.  Devika Rani was the first recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, recognizing her pioneering contributions to Indian cinema.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The cash prize amount is stated incorrectly.  The actual amount is ₹10 Lakhs, not ₹100 Lakhs.  This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in questions about awards and their specifications.

Statement 2 is correct. Devika Rani's recognition as the first recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is a well-established fact. Her contributions to early Indian cinema make her a fitting first recipient, symbolizing the award's aim to honor lifetime achievements in the industry.  The question tests factual recall of key figures in Indian cinema history.


**5. With reference to the Non-Cooperation Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement's success was significantly hampered by the Chauri Chaura incident, leading to its premature withdrawal by Mahatma Gandhi.
2.  Prominent figures like Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Motilal Nehru actively participated, demonstrating broad-based support across different factions within the Indian National Congress.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chauri Chaura incident, a violent clash between protestors and police, significantly impacted the Non-Cooperation Movement.  Mahatma Gandhi's decision to withdraw the movement, despite widespread support, demonstrates his commitment to non-violent methods and highlights the challenges of managing a mass movement.  This illustrates the complexities of India's freedom struggle and the strategic decisions involved.

Statement 2 is also correct. The participation of key Congress leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Motilal Nehru reflects the broad appeal and support for the Non-Cooperation Movement. The involvement of diverse leaders within the Congress highlights the movement's impact on the broader political landscape and its ability to unite disparate groups under a common cause. This showcases the multifaceted nature of the movement and its diverse leadership.


**6. With reference to the Quit India Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement, launched on August 9, 1942, was primarily focused on achieving complete independence from British rule through non-violent means.
2. The movement witnessed widespread participation from students and workers across various regions of India, but saw limited involvement from the Princely states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Quit India Movement aimed for complete independence, its methods were not exclusively non-violent.  The movement saw a significant increase in violent actions compared to previous non-cooperation movements. The statement incorrectly simplifies the movement's tactics, which reflected the growing frustration and impatience for independence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Quit India Movement saw significant participation from students and workers across India. However, Princely states showed a generally low-key response, highlighting the complexities of the movement's reach and the differing allegiances within India at the time. This reveals the political fragmentation of India and the challenges faced in unifying the country against British rule.


**7.  With reference to Lal Bahadur Shastri, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following a major railway accident, Shastri resigned from his position as Minister for Railways, demonstrating his commitment to accountability and integrity.
2.  Shastri's economic policies closely followed those of Jawaharlal Nehru, prioritizing centralized planning and state intervention in the economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Lal Bahadur Shastri's resignation after a major railway accident exemplifies his commitment to accountability and ethical governance. This action highlights his character and leadership qualities, which are often discussed in the context of his political career.  This is an example of a leader prioritizing ethics and responsibility over political expediency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shastri initially worked within the framework established by Nehru, his economic policies later diverged. He  emphasized decentralization, reduced the dominance of the Planning Commission, and introduced slogans like "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan", indicating a shift in economic and social priorities. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of Shastri's economic vision.  It is crucial to understand the nuances of his policies and their departure from Nehruvian socialism.


**8. With reference to Mahatma Gandhi's contributions to India's freedom struggle, consider the following statements:**

1. The Champaran Satyagraha (1917) marked Gandhi's first major application of Satyagraha in India, focusing on the plight of indigo farmers in Bihar.
2. The Kheda Satyagraha (1918), primarily concerned with tax relief for farmers affected by crop failure, was a significant precursor to the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Champaran Satyagraha is widely regarded as Gandhi's first successful application of Satyagraha in India.  His intervention on behalf of the indigo farmers in Bihar established his leadership in the Indian freedom struggle and demonstrated the effectiveness of non-violent resistance.  This event is a critical turning point in Gandhi's career and the history of Indian nationalism.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Kheda Satyagraha, though smaller in scale than Champaran, demonstrated Gandhi's growing influence and solidified his approach to non-violent civil disobedience.  Its success in securing tax relief for affected farmers directly contributed to the momentum building towards the Non-Cooperation Movement.  The chronological order and the interconnectedness of these movements are important aspects of understanding Gandhi's strategy.


These examples showcase the variety of difficult questions that can be framed, demanding precise factual recall and nuanced understanding.  Remember that creating truly difficult questions requires careful consideration of potential distractors and the subtle differences in related concepts.

**1. With reference to the socio-religious reform movements in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Dayananda Saraswati, advocated for the revival of Vedic Hinduism and opposed idolatry and caste discrimination.  It also promoted Vedic education and social reforms such as widow remarriage.
2.  The Brahmo Samaj, initiated by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, focused primarily on monotheism, rationalism, and social reform, advocating for the abolition of sati and promoting women's education.  It had a significant impact in Bengal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the core tenets and impacts of the Arya Samaj and Brahmo Samaj movements. The Arya Samaj, with its emphasis on Vedic principles and opposition to social evils like caste discrimination, played a crucial role in Hindu reform.  Dayananda Saraswati's advocacy for Vedic education and social reform, including widow remarriage, significantly contributed to the modernization of Hindu society.  Similarly, the Brahmo Samaj, spearheaded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, played a vital role in the Indian Renaissance.  Its focus on monotheism, rationalism, and social reform, particularly its successful campaign against sati (widow immolation), and its promotion of women's education, had a substantial impact, especially in Bengal.  Therefore, both statements are factually correct, making option (c) the appropriate choice.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only acknowledge one of the movements, while option (d) is incorrect because both statements correctly depict the historical reality of these influential reform movements.


**2. With reference to the early phases of Indian nationalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian National Congress, from its inception, advocated for complete independence from British rule, employing strategies of civil disobedience and non-cooperation.  Early leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale actively pursued this goal.
2.  The Partition of Bengal in 1905, while intended to weaken nationalist sentiment, instead galvanized the Swadeshi movement, fostering a surge in nationalist activity and a renewed focus on self-reliance (Swadeshi).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Partition of Bengal, a divisive administrative measure by the British, unexpectedly strengthened the nationalist movement. It sparked widespread protests and the Swadeshi movement, promoting the use of Indian-made goods and fostering a sense of national unity and self-reliance.  This directly contradicts the British intention to weaken nationalist sentiment.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian National Congress initially focused on constitutional means to achieve self-governance within the British Empire, gradually evolving towards the goal of complete independence.  While leaders like Gokhale were key figures in the early Congress, the initial demands were not for complete independence.  The demand for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) emerged later.  The strategy of civil disobedience and non-cooperation also evolved over time.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making option (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the historical trajectory of early Indian nationalism and the impact of the Bengal Partition.


**3. With reference to the impact of British rule on India's economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  British policies systematically deindustrialized India, dismantling traditional industries and shifting the economy towards the production of raw materials for export to Britain. This resulted in a significant decline in India's manufacturing sector.
2.  The British introduced modern infrastructure like railways, primarily to facilitate the exploitation of India's resources and the transport of raw materials, rather than for the benefit of the Indian population. This infrastructure, however, inadvertently contributed to some aspects of economic development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the British economic impact on India. Statement 1 correctly points out the deindustrialization policy pursued by the British.  The destruction of traditional Indian industries, like textiles, and the focus on raw material production for export to Britain significantly hampered the growth of India's manufacturing sector. This created a dependent economy, leading to widespread poverty and economic stagnation.  This is a well-established fact in economic history.

Statement 2 accurately describes the primary motive behind the construction of railways in India.  While the railways undoubtedly facilitated the exploitation of Indian resources and the export of raw materials to Britain, their development also inadvertently fostered some aspects of economic growth, such as improved connectivity and the expansion of trade networks.  However, the primary benefit was for the British, not the Indian population.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making option (c) the most appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the dual nature of the British economic impact on India – both destructive deindustrialization and the unintended positive consequences of infrastructure development.


**4.  With reference to the Indian independence movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920, aimed at achieving complete independence from British rule through mass civil disobedience and non-violent resistance.  It involved a widespread boycott of British goods and institutions.
2.  The Quit India Movement of 1942, a more radical phase of the independence struggle, was characterized by widespread civil disobedience and underground activities, leading to mass arrests and repression by the British.  It saw the participation of various groups, including socialists and communists.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Quit India Movement was a decisive moment in the Indian independence struggle, marked by widespread and largely spontaneous civil disobedience, underground activities, and significant participation from various political groups. The British responded with widespread arrests and harsh repression, but the movement significantly weakened British control and accelerated the process towards independence.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Non-Cooperation Movement did involve mass civil disobedience and a boycott of British goods, its primary goal was not complete independence initially.  The movement was suspended prematurely by Gandhi due to the Chauri Chaura incident. The demand for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) evolved over time.  Therefore, only statement 2 completely and accurately captures the essence of the Quit India Movement, making (b) the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect due to their inaccurate portrayal of the goals and nature of the Non-Cooperation and Quit India movements.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of the Green Revolution in India:**

1.  The Green Revolution, while significantly increasing food production, led to a decline in the diversity of crops cultivated and increased dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, negatively impacting soil health and biodiversity.
2.  The Green Revolution primarily benefited large farmers, contributing to increased income inequality in the agricultural sector and marginalizing small and marginal farmers.  This led to regional disparities in agricultural development and increased rural indebtedness.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe significant consequences of the Green Revolution in India. Statement 1 correctly highlights the negative environmental impacts of the Green Revolution.  The focus on high-yielding varieties of a limited number of crops (wheat and rice primarily) led to a decline in crop diversity. The increased use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides resulted in soil degradation, water pollution, and a loss of biodiversity. These environmental consequences are well documented.

Statement 2 accurately captures the socio-economic disparities caused by the Green Revolution.  The benefits of the Green Revolution were disproportionately enjoyed by large farmers who had access to irrigation, credit, and technology.  Small and marginal farmers lacked these resources, resulting in increased income inequality and exacerbating rural indebtedness and regional disparities.  Thus, both statements reflect the complex and multifaceted consequences of the Green Revolution, making option (c) the correct choice. Options (a), (b), and (d) are inaccurate because they fail to capture the full scope of both the environmental and socio-economic implications of this pivotal agricultural transformation.


**6. With reference to the various awards conferred by the Indian government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, is conferred annually on individuals for exceptional and distinguished service in any field.  The award is bestowed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
2.  The Padma Awards, instituted in 1954, comprise three categories—Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri— recognizing outstanding and distinguished service in various fields.  These awards are conferred on the recommendation of the Padma Awards Committee, headed by the Cabinet Secretary.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe the Bharat Ratna and Padma Awards, two of the most prestigious awards conferred by the Indian government. Statement 1 accurately describes the Bharat Ratna. It is indeed India's highest civilian award, conferred for exceptional service. Although there is no formal recommendation process, the Prime Minister's recommendation carries significant weight.  The President ultimately bestows the award.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Padma Awards.  Instituted in 1954 (with some interruptions), the Padma Awards consist of three categories recognizing exceptional and distinguished service. The Padma Awards Committee, headed by the Cabinet Secretary, makes the recommendations, which are then submitted for approval by the Prime Minister and the President. Therefore, both statements are accurate descriptions of these awards, making (c) the correct option.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately represent the criteria and procedures for conferring both the Bharat Ratna and Padma Awards.


**7. With reference to the impact of colonialism on India's socio-cultural landscape, consider the following statements:**

1.  British colonial policies led to the suppression of indigenous cultural practices, languages, and art forms, while simultaneously promoting Western education and administrative systems. This created a complex interplay of cultural preservation and assimilation.
2.  The introduction of Western education and administrative systems by the British, while intended to serve colonial interests, inadvertently contributed to the growth of Indian nationalism and the development of modern Indian identity.  This created a space for the emergence of new ideas and intellectual movements.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly capture the complex and paradoxical impact of British colonialism on India's socio-cultural fabric.  Statement 1 accurately points out the suppression of indigenous cultures.  British colonial policies often actively sought to suppress or marginalize local languages, art forms, and cultural practices.  However, simultaneously, they introduced Western education and administrative systems. This led to a complex interaction between the preservation of traditional culture and the adoption of Western influences.  This created a unique cultural landscape that was a blend of the traditional and the modern.

Statement 2 correctly points out the paradoxical role of Western education and administrative systems in fostering nationalism.  While introduced to serve British colonial interests, these very systems inadvertently helped create conditions for the rise of Indian nationalism. The exposure to Western ideals of democracy, liberty, and self-determination, coupled with the growing awareness of the exploitative nature of colonial rule, fuelled nationalist sentiment and contributed to the formation of a modern Indian identity. Therefore, both statements accurately capture the duality of the colonial impact, making (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to recognize the complex interplay of cultural suppression and unintended consequences of colonial policies in shaping modern India.


**8. With reference to the socio-economic conditions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India has a large informal sector, characterized by low wages, lack of social security, and precarious employment conditions. This sector employs a substantial portion of India's workforce, contributing significantly to the national economy, but also posing challenges related to income inequality and worker protection.
2.  India's agricultural sector, while employing a significant portion of the workforce, suffers from low productivity, small and fragmented landholdings, and limited access to technology and credit. This contributes to rural poverty and income inequality, hindering overall economic development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect critical aspects of India's socio-economic realities. Statement 1 correctly describes the large and significant informal sector in India.  A substantial portion of the Indian workforce is employed in the informal economy.  This sector is characterized by low wages, a lack of social security benefits, and precarious employment. This informal sector contributes significantly to the national economy but creates challenges related to income inequality, worker exploitation, and the lack of worker protection.  These are well-known features of the Indian economy.

Statement 2 accurately highlights the challenges facing India's agricultural sector.  Agriculture is still a major employer in India, but it suffers from low productivity due to factors such as small and fragmented landholdings, limited access to modern technology, and inadequate credit facilities. These factors contribute significantly to rural poverty, income inequality, and hinder overall economic development. Therefore, both statements are factually correct representations of pertinent socio-economic issues in India, making (c) the appropriate choice.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to fully represent the complexity and interconnectedness of the challenges faced by both the informal sector and the agricultural sector in India's economy.

It prioritizes multilateralism and international cooperation through participation in various forums, including the UN and BRICS.  It also actively engages with regional organizations like SAARC and BIMSTEC.  This multifaceted approach has been a cornerstone of India's foreign policy.

Statement 2 accurately describes the 'Act East Policy'.  This policy represents a significant strategic shift, aimed at strengthening India's economic and strategic ties with East Asia, particularly the ASEAN region.  This is part of a broader strategy to increase India's influence in the Indo-Pacific.  The policy encompasses economic cooperation, security collaborations, and infrastructure development projects.  Therefore, both statements accurately represent India's foreign policy approach, making (c) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to capture the comprehensive nature of India's foreign policy and the specific aims and actions of the 'Act East Policy'.

**2. Consider the following statements regarding the cultural significance of Jharkhand:**

1. The Paitkar painting tradition, originating in Jharkhand, is primarily practiced by tribal men who inherit the skill through paternal lineages.
2.  The Baidyanath Temple, a significant religious site in Jharkhand, is associated with the worship of Lord Shiva and attracts pilgrims from across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Paitkar painting is indeed a significant tribal art form of Jharkhand, it's inaccurate to state that it's *primarily* practiced by tribal men and inherited through paternal lineages.  Paitkar painting, like many tribal art forms, shows a matrilineal transmission of skills, with women playing a significant role in its continuation. The statement misrepresents the actual practice.

1.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati, born in Tankara, Gujarat, in 1825, vehemently opposed the practice of donating to priests, advocating for direct religious experience over intermediary rituals.
2.  His major literary works, including "Satyarth Prakash," "Sanskar Vidhi," and "Rigved Bhashyam," significantly influenced the Arya Samaj movement's social reform agenda.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Dayanand Saraswati, while born in 1824 (not 1825), strongly criticized the practice of offering donations to priests, seeing it as a form of exploitation and a hindrance to direct spiritual understanding. He emphasized the importance of studying the Vedas directly and engaging in self-reflection rather than relying on priestly interpretations. This aspect of his teachings formed a cornerstone of the Arya Samaj's reformist ideology.

Statement 2 is correct.  "Satyarth Prakash," "Sanskar Vidhi," and "Rigved Bhashyam" are indeed among Swami Dayanand Saraswati's most influential works. These texts formed the basis of the Arya Samaj's philosophy, advocating for social reforms such as widow remarriage, women's education, and the elimination of caste-based discrimination.  The books' clear and direct style contributed to their widespread influence within the movement.


**5. With reference to the Konark Sun Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  Constructed in the 12th century CE by King Narasimhadeva I, the Konark Sun Temple in Odisha is a UNESCO World Heritage site renowned for its intricate stone carvings and colossal chariot design.
2. The 24 wheels of the Konark Sun Temple, each approximately 10 feet in diameter, symbolize the passage of time and the cyclical nature of life.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Konark Sun Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage site and celebrated for its intricate carvings and chariot-like structure, it was built in the 13th century CE (not the 12th), by King Narasimhadeva I during his reign (1238-1264 CE). The statement contains an error in its chronology.

Statement 2 is correct. The 24 wheels are a defining feature of the temple's design.  While the exact diameter might vary slightly from source to source, the statement accurately reflects their symbolic importance—representing the passage of time and the cyclical nature of life, reflecting a cosmological understanding prevalent in Odishan temple architecture.


**6. With reference to Raigad Fort, consider the following statements:**

1. Located atop a steep hill in the Konkan region of Maharashtra, Raigad Fort served as a crucial military stronghold for the Mughal Empire during its expansion in the 17th century.
2. The fort's formidable fortifications, earning it the moniker "Gibraltar of the East," played a vital role in the Maratha Empire's defense against various invaders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Raigad Fort is indeed located on a hill and is known for its strong defenses, it was the *Maratha Empire*, not the Mughal Empire, that used it as a key military stronghold.  The statement incorrectly attributes the fort's significance to the Mughal Empire, a major historical inaccuracy.  Shivaji Maharaj established Raigad as his capital.

Statement 2 is correct.  Raigad Fort's strategic location and impressive fortifications are the reasons behind its nickname, "Gibraltar of the East." Its defensive capabilities allowed it to withstand numerous sieges and attacks, making it a pivotal point in the Maratha Empire's military strategy and territorial control. The comparison to Gibraltar highlights the fort's resilience and importance in the context of its time.


**7. With reference to the Kumbh Mela, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years at four locations along sacred rivers, is a 45-day event primarily associated with the purification of sins through ritual bathing in the Shipra River.
2.  The rotating locations of the Kumbh Mela—Haridwar, Ujjain, Nashik, and Prayagraj—are determined by astrological calculations based on the conjunction of specific planets and the positions of the sun and moon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Kumbh Mela is held every 12 years at four locations and involves ritual bathing, the statement incorrectly limits the sacred rivers to the Shipra.  The Mela is held on the Ganges (Haridwar), Shipra (Ujjain), Godavari (Nashik), and at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati (Prayagraj).  The statement's focus on only the Shipra River is a significant inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The precise locations and dates of the Kumbh Mela are indeed determined through complex astrological calculations. These calculations consider the alignment of specific planets and the position of the sun and moon, all of which are believed to have a bearing on the auspiciousness of the event. This astrological determination is a central aspect of the Mela's religious significance.


**8. With reference to India's core sector industries, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's core sector industries, comprising eight key sectors, contribute approximately 35% to the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), reflecting their significant role in the national economy.
2.  The eight core sector industries include automobiles, electricity, food processing, fertilizers, cement, steel, crude oil, and natural gas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the eight core sector industries are indeed crucial to India's economy and reflected in the IIP, their contribution is around 40% (not 35%), showcasing their significant weight in the overall industrial production index.  The statement presents an inaccurate figure regarding the IIP contribution.

Statement 2 is correct. The eight core sector industries in India do include electricity, fertilizers, cement, steel, and crude oil as well as natural gas.

1.  Geographical Indications (GI) tags are exclusively awarded to agricultural and food products, protecting their unique characteristics linked to their specific geographical origin.
2.  Darjeeling tea, the first product to receive a GI tag in India, exemplifies the system's role in safeguarding the reputation and quality of specific regional products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many GI tags are given to agricultural and food products, the system isn't limited to these categories.  Geographical Indications protect the unique characteristics of products linked to a specific geographical location, encompassing a wider range of goods, including handicrafts, industrial products, and more.  The statement misrepresents the scope of GI protection.

Statement 2 is correct. Darjeeling tea was indeed one of the first products (not *the* first) to receive a GI tag in India, marking a significant step in protecting the reputation and quality of this iconic tea.  The GI tag helped prevent the misuse of the Darjeeling name and ensured that only tea produced in the specified Darjeeling region could use the designation, safeguarding its unique characteristics and market value.  The precision of the statement's claim is crucial.  It is not the first product to be given GI tag.



**10. With reference to India's foreign exchange reserves, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) acts as the custodian of India's foreign exchange reserves, managing and safeguarding these assets on behalf of the nation.
2.  Foreign currency assets constitute the largest component of India's forex reserves, followed by gold reserves, reflecting the country's reliance on international trade and investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI is indeed the custodian of India's foreign exchange reserves. It manages these reserves, ensuring their safety and liquidity, and plays a vital role in maintaining the stability of the Indian rupee.  The RBI's role in this regard is a key aspect of India's macroeconomic management.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While foreign currency assets are a significant component of India's foreign exchange reserves, it's inaccurate to state that they constitute the *largest* component.  Gold reserves, in fact, often form the largest share of India's forex reserves, followed by foreign currency assets.  The statement reverses the actual proportions.  The order of the largest component is incorrect.  Gold reserves are the largest component followed by Foreign currency assets.


**11. With reference to dry ports in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dry ports, strategically located inland, serve as customs-controlled centers for efficient handling of import and export cargo, reducing congestion at major seaports.
2.  The primary mode of transportation connecting dry ports to seaports is through railways, ensuring faster and more cost-effective movement of goods.

Statement 1 is correct. Dry ports are inland customs stations that facilitate the efficient handling of import and export cargo. By decentralizing cargo handling, dry ports alleviate congestion at major seaports, improving overall logistics efficiency. This contributes to cost savings and faster turnaround times for businesses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While railways are a common mode of transport for connecting dry ports to seaports, it is not the *primary* mode.  Road transport also plays a significant role, particularly for shorter distances and specific cargo types. The statement oversimplifies the transportation aspect by emphasizing only railways.  Both railways and road transport are important.


**12. With reference to participatory notes (PNs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Participatory notes (PNs) are instruments issued by registered Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) to overseas investors who wish to invest in the Indian stock market without direct registration.
2.  The issuance of PNs is unregulated in India, allowing for greater flexibility and ease of investment for foreign investors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Participatory notes (PNs) are indeed issued by registered FIIs to overseas investors who want to invest in Indian securities without undergoing the process of registering themselves directly with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).  PNs provide a convenient mechanism for indirect investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The issuance of PNs is *regulated* in India, although the regulations are often subject to debate and revisions.  SEBI monitors PNs to track foreign investment in Indian markets and to manage associated risks.  The statement's claim of unregulated issuance is fundamentally false.  It is regulated by SEBI.


**13. With reference to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The MPC, constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, is responsible for determining the country's monetary policy, including key policy rates like the repo rate.
2.  The MPC's composition includes six members, with three nominated by the Government of India and three ex-officio members from the RBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MPC is indeed constituted under Section 45ZB of the amended RBI Act, 1934, and its primary function is to formulate and implement India's monetary policy. This includes setting key policy rates such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, which directly influence the cost of borrowing and lending in the economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MPC has six members, but the composition is not exactly as described. Three members are nominated by the Government of India, but the other three are not simply "ex-officio members from the RBI". The Governor of RBI is the ex-officio Chairperson, and the other two members are Deputy Governors of RBI.  The statement simplifies the membership structure inaccurately.


**14. With reference to Indian Rupee depreciation, consider the following statements:**

1.  A depreciating Indian Rupee makes imports more expensive for Indian consumers, potentially leading to inflation and reduced purchasing power.
2.  A weaker Rupee can boost exports by making Indian goods cheaper for foreign buyers, improving the country's trade balance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  When the Indian Rupee depreciates against other currencies, it becomes more expensive for India to import goods and services.  This increased cost can lead to higher prices for consumers (inflation) and a decrease in their purchasing power, impacting the overall standard of living.

Statement 2 is correct. A weaker Rupee conversely makes Indian exports more competitive in the international market because they become cheaper for foreign buyers.  This can lead to an increase in export demand, potentially improving India's trade balance and boosting economic growth in export-oriented sectors.  Both effects are interconnected aspects of exchange rate dynamics.


**15. With reference to Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  MSPs are guaranteed prices set by the government for a select group of crops, aiming to ensure a minimum income for farmers and to stabilize agricultural markets.
2.  The MSPs for all agricultural crops are fixed based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), considering factors such as production costs and market prices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MSPs are indeed government-set prices for certain crops, intended to provide farmers with a minimum level of income and to prevent excessive price fluctuations in agricultural markets.  The MSP mechanism is a critical component of India's agricultural policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP makes recommendations for MSPs, it's not the sole determinant.  The final decision on MSPs rests with the Government of India, considering various factors beyond the CACP's recommendations, including budgetary constraints, political considerations, and overall macroeconomic conditions.  The statement oversimplifies the decision-making process for MSPs.


**16. With reference to the textile industry in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's textile industry contributes approximately 12% to the nation's GDP, making it a major contributor to the overall economy.
2. India holds a global market share of around 8% in the textile and apparel trade, highlighting its significant presence in the international market.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the textile industry is a large contributor to India's economy, its contribution to the GDP is closer to 9% (not 12%). The statement overestimates the industry's share of the GDP.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's share of the global textile and apparel trade is indeed approximately 8-10%, showcasing its prominence as a significant player in the international market. This significant share underscores the industry's export potential and its importance in the global value chain.

1. Established in 1958, NAFED operates under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, aiming to strengthen the cooperative marketing of agricultural produce.
2. NAFED's primary objective is to ensure fair prices for farmers' produce, eliminating intermediaries and facilitating direct access to markets for better returns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NAFED was indeed established in 1958 and aims to improve agricultural marketing, it operates under the Ministry of Cooperation (not the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare). The statement misattributes the administrative ministry.

Statement 2 is correct. NAFED's primary objective is to assist farmers in getting better prices for their produce by minimizing the role of intermediaries. This helps farmers increase their income and improve their economic well-being.


**18. With reference to coking coal, consider the following statements:**

1. Coking coal, a high-quality coal type used in steel production, is primarily sourced from domestic mines in India, meeting the nation's growing demand.
2.  India's reliance on imported coking coal has decreased significantly in recent years due to increased domestic production and exploration of new coalfields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While coking coal is essential for steel production, India is a significant *importer* of coking coal, despite having domestic reserves. Domestic production often falls short of meeting the demand, leading to a significant reliance on imports. The statement misrepresents India's coking coal self-sufficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's reliance on imported coking coal remains substantial, despite efforts to increase domestic production.  While some progress has been made in exploration and production, the gap between demand and domestic supply persists.  The statement is factually inaccurate regarding the reduction in reliance on imports.

**1. With reference to oilseed production in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Groundnut accounts for more than half of the total oilseed production in India.
2.  Andhra Pradesh is the largest producer of groundnut, followed by Tamil Nadu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While groundnut is a significant oilseed crop in India, it does not constitute more than half of the total oilseed production.  The exact proportions vary year to year depending on various factors like weather and agricultural practices, but  other oilseeds like soybean, rapeseed-mustard, and sunflower also contribute substantially to the overall oilseed production.  Therefore,  claiming groundnut to be over 50% is an overstatement.

Statement 2 is correct. Andhra Pradesh consistently ranks as the leading producer of groundnut in India, with Tamil Nadu holding a strong second position.  These two states together contribute a significant portion of the nation's groundnut output, reflecting their favorable climatic and soil conditions suitable for groundnut cultivation.  The consistent high production in these states is well-documented in agricultural statistics.

2.  Black soils are particularly well-suited for the cultivation of sunflower.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sunflowers are classified as day-neutral plants. This characteristic allows them to flower and mature across a broader range of photoperiods (day lengths), making them adaptable to various geographical locations and planting times. This contrasts with short-day or long-day plants, whose flowering is strictly regulated by day length. This adaptability is a key factor in the successful cultivation of sunflowers across diverse regions.

Statement 2 is correct. Black soils, also known as regur soils, possess high water-retention capacity and are rich in nutrients. These qualities make them ideal for cultivating sunflower, contributing to higher yields and overall crop success.  While sunflowers can grow in other soil types, the inherent properties of black soils provide an optimal environment for their growth, resulting in their preference among farmers in regions with this soil type.


**3. With reference to Sesamum (Sesame) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sesamum is primarily a rabi crop, meaning it is sown in the winter season.
2.  Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are among the major Sesamum producing states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sesamum can be grown as a rabi crop in some regions,  it is more accurately classified as a kharif crop in most of its growing areas in India.  The sowing time varies with the region and climate, but the majority of the crop is sown during the monsoon season (kharif).  Therefore, classifying it solely as a rabi crop is an oversimplification.

Statement 2 is correct. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are among the major Sesamum-producing states of India.  These states offer suitable climatic conditions and soil types for Sesamum cultivation, resulting in significant production volumes.  Their contribution to the national Sesamum output is well-documented in agricultural data.  Other states like Haryana also contribute significantly.


**4. With reference to the Indian textile industry, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's domestic apparel and textile industry contributes approximately 12% to the country’s exports.
2.  India is the second-largest producer of silk globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that India's domestic apparel and textile industry contributes approximately 12% to its *industrial production* and 13% to its *exports*.  The statement conflates industrial production with export contribution, presenting an inaccurate figure for export contribution.  While a significant portion of textile production is exported, the exact percentage is different from the figure given in the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that India is the second-largest producer of silk in the world. This highlights India's significant role in the global silk industry, owing to its extensive sericulture practices and traditional expertise in silk production. This position is widely acknowledged in international trade and agricultural reports.


**5. With reference to the National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), consider the following statements:**

1. NAFED is registered under the Indian Cooperative Societies Act.
2. NAFED comes under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NAFED is registered under the *Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act*, not the Indian Cooperative Societies Act. This distinction is crucial as it highlights NAFED's operational scope across multiple states, governed by a specific legal framework designed for such multi-state cooperatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NAFED comes under the *Ministry of Agriculture*, not the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. This is a critical distinction as it clarifies NAFED's primary role in agricultural marketing and support to farmers, rather than consumer affairs or public distribution.  The Ministry of Agriculture's oversight ensures NAFED's focus remains aligned with national agricultural policies and farmer welfare programs.


**6. With reference to the classification of coal in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Coking coal constitutes a significant portion of India's total coal resources.
2. Non-coking coal is primarily used for power generation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that coking coal constitutes only a *small* part of India's total coal resources. This indicates that the majority of India's coal reserves consist of non-coking coal. This fact is important in understanding India's energy mix and its reliance on imports for coking coal, a crucial component in steel production.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage clearly states that non-coking coal is mainly used for power generation. This is a key aspect of India's energy sector, highlighting the significant role of non-coking coal in electricity production.  While it also has other uses, power generation is its primary application.


**7.  With reference to India's coking coal imports, consider the following statements:**

1. India's coking coal imports for the first six months of FY24 were at a five-year high.
2.  Shipments from Russia constituted a significant portion of India's total coking coal imports during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that India's coking coal imports were at a *six-year*, not five-year, high during the first six months of the current fiscal year.  This difference, while seemingly minor, is crucial for accurate factual recall.  The six-year high signifies a significant increase in import dependency compared to the preceding five years.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions a substantial rise (over 200%) in coking coal shipments from Russia during the specified period. This indicates that Russia played a major role in supplying India's increased coking coal needs, making it a significant contributor to the overall import volume.  This information is directly presented in the source text and is a key point.


**8. With reference to the  public stockholding (PSH) policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The PSH policy allows the government to procure crops from farmers at Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and distribute them to the poor.
2. Under WTO's De Minimis limits, a country’s subsidy bill for PSH should not exceed 10% of the value of production for developed countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PSH policy aims to ensure food security by enabling government procurement of crops at MSP, storage, and distribution to vulnerable populations. This is a core function of the PSH policy, directly contributing to food security and welfare programs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The De Minimis limit for developed countries is 5%, not 10%. The 10% limit applies to developing countries.  This distinction is crucial in understanding the different obligations and challenges faced by developed and developing nations within the WTO framework regarding agricultural subsidies.  The lower limit for developed countries reflects their greater capacity to manage agricultural markets without significant government intervention.


**9. With reference to the WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement aims to curb harmful fisheries subsidies, which contribute to overfishing and the depletion of fish stocks.
2. India is a signatory to the Agreement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, part of the Geneva Package adopted at the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference, directly addresses the issue of harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing and the depletion of global fish stocks.  This is a key objective of the agreement, aiming to promote sustainable fishing practices and the conservation of marine resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that India is *not* a part of the Agreement. This highlights India's reservations regarding certain aspects of the agreement, particularly concerning special and differential treatment for developing countries.  India's non-participation reflects its concerns about the potential impact on its domestic fishing industry and its call for a more equitable framework within the WTO.


**10. With reference to the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The NBS policy was introduced in 2015 to provide fertilizers to farmers at subsidized prices.
2.  The NBS policy applies to all grades of fertilizers, including urea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NBS policy was introduced in 2010, not 2015. This chronological detail is important for understanding the evolution of fertilizer subsidy policies in India. The earlier introduction date reflects the government's long-standing commitment to supporting farmers through subsidized fertilizer access.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NBS policy does *not* apply to urea; the MRP for urea is fixed by the government.  This is a key distinction between urea and other fertilizers under the NBS scheme. Urea's price control reflects its importance as a staple fertilizer and the government's aim to ensure its affordability for farmers.  The NBS scheme, on the other hand, aims to provide a market-based mechanism for other fertilizers while offering subsidies.


**11. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PM-KISAN scheme provides an annual income support of ₹6,000 to all landholding farmer families in India.
2.  All institutional landholders are excluded from the benefits of the PM-KISAN scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PM-KISAN scheme does provide an annual income support of ₹6,000 to eligible landholding farmer families, it does not cover *all* landholding farmer families.  The scheme has specific exclusion criteria, such as income thresholds and the exclusion of certain categories of individuals, to target the most needy farmer families.  Therefore, the statement is overly broad.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly lists "All institutional land holders" among the excluded categories for PM-KISAN benefits.  This exclusion is a crucial aspect of the scheme's design, focusing its resources on individual farmers and their families rather than institutional landholders.  This targeted approach ensures that the scheme's limited resources are directed towards those most in need of support.


**12. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), consider the following statements:**

1. The PMFBY covers all crops, including those without Minimum Support Prices (MSP).
2. The premium under PMFBY is determined solely by the actuarial premium rate (APR) set by insurance companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PMFBY provides coverage for crops whether or not they have an MSP. For crops with MSP, the insured sum is based on MSP or scale of finance. For crops without MSP, the farm gate price is considered. This broad coverage is a key feature, extending insurance protection to a wider range of agricultural produce and farmers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The premium under PMFBY is the lower of either the percentage of sum assured or the APR set by insurance companies. This ensures that farmers do not bear an excessive premium burden, while still providing adequate risk coverage.  The mechanism ensures a balance between affordability for farmers and the viability of the insurance scheme.


**13. With reference to the Coastal Aquaculture Authority (CAA) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act includes freshwater aquaculture within its scope of regulation.
2. The amended Act, 2023, increases the imprisonment provisions for contravention of the Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act specifically excludes freshwater aquaculture from its purview, focusing solely on coastal aquaculture in saline or brackish water. This focus is crucial for targeted regulation and management of coastal ecosystems and resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2023 amendment *removes* the imprisonment provisions, replacing them with monetary penalties.  This change reflects a shift towards a more lenient approach to enforcement, promoting ease of doing business while still maintaining regulatory oversight.  The removal of imprisonment is a significant change in the amended Act.


**14. With reference to India's inland fisheries, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's inland capture fisheries have surpassed China's in terms of production.
2. Inland fisheries encompass both capture fisheries and culture fisheries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that India has recently overtaken China to become the largest contributor to inland capture water fisheries. This signifies a significant achievement for India's fisheries sector, highlighting its growing role in global fish production.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly defines inland fisheries as encompassing both capture fisheries (harvesting directly from natural water bodies) and culture fisheries (raising fish in controlled environments). This dual aspect is essential for a comprehensive understanding of inland fisheries, encompassing both traditional and modern aquaculture practices.


**15. With reference to the  State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI) 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEI 2023 was developed by the Ministry of Power in collaboration with AEEE.
2. Karnataka was ranked as the top performer in SEEI 2023 due to its active energy conservation and efficiency policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEEI 2023 was developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), not the Ministry of Power, in collaboration with the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE).  This distinction highlights the role of BEE as the key implementing agency for energy efficiency initiatives in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions that Karnataka was ranked top in SEEI 2023 and that it is the only state with an active “Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency Policy”. This underscores the importance of comprehensive policy frameworks in achieving energy efficiency goals at the state level.  The success of Karnataka highlights the positive impact of dedicated state-level policies.


**16. With reference to the  "Clean & Green Villages" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative is primarily focused on promoting solar power generation in rural areas.
2. The Ministry of Rural Development is the sole implementing agency for the initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The initiative prioritizes clean and green villages and focuses on leveraging solar power expansion in rural areas to achieve the objectives of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.  This emphasis on solar energy aligns with global efforts to promote renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) is the lead agency,  other ministries like the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, and Ministry of Fisheries are also involved.  This collaborative approach highlights the multi-sectoral nature of the initiative, requiring coordinated efforts across various government departments to achieve its goals of creating sustainable and clean rural environments.  The involvement of multiple ministries indicates a collaborative effort and should not be misunderstood as the Ministry of Rural Development being solely responsible.


**17. With reference to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMD is one of the five Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
2. The IMD's National Framework of Climate Services (NFCS) is based on the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) of the WMO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMD is one of the *six*, not five, Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres of the WMO.  This numerical precision is important for accurate factual recall. The fact that the IMD is one of six regional centers highlights its significant role within the global meteorological network.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the IMD's NFCS is based on the WMO's GFCS. This demonstrates the alignment of India's climate services with international best practices and standards, promoting cooperation and data sharing within the global climate community.


**18. With reference to the Indian Landslide Susceptibility Map (ILSM), consider the following statements:**

1. The ILSM uses 12 landslide conditioning factors to assess landslide susceptibility.
2.  Sikkim has the highest absolute area susceptible to landslides in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ILSM uses *16*, not 12, landslide conditioning factors.  This difference in the number of factors is significant, reflecting the complexity of landslide prediction and the need for a comprehensive assessment incorporating various geological, topographical, and climatic variables.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sikkim has the highest *percentage* of land area susceptible to landslides, but Arunachal Pradesh has the highest *absolute* area.  This distinction highlights the importance of understanding both relative and absolute measures when interpreting spatial data.  While Sikkim's high percentage indicates a high level of risk relative to its size, Arunachal Pradesh's larger absolute area means a greater total land area is at risk.


**19.  With reference to the Weather Information Network and Data System (WINDS), consider the following statements:**

1. WINDS aims to generate short-term, hyperlocal weather data for farmers.
2.  The WINDS portal will integrate weather data from more than 1 lakh ground stations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. WINDS aims to generate *long-term*, not short-term, hyperlocal weather data.  This temporal distinction is crucial for understanding the system's purpose. Long-term data is essential for agricultural planning and decision-making, allowing farmers to adapt their practices to seasonal variations and climate change impacts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WINDS program will install more than *2 lakh*, not 1 lakh, ground stations. This difference in scale is significant, highlighting the ambitious scope of the project to significantly enhance the density and accuracy of weather data collection across India.  A larger number of stations will lead to more precise hyperlocal forecasting.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878,  deals exclusively with the discovery of hidden treasure, excluding any provisions related to ancient artifacts.
2. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, primarily focuses on the protection of ancient structures, with minimal emphasis on the regulation of antiquities trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878, while primarily concerned with hidden treasure, also encompasses the legal framework for dealing with discovered antiquities that might be considered treasure trove.  The Act's scope extends beyond purely monetary treasure to include objects of historical or archaeological significance.  Therefore, the statement's assertion of exclusive focus on hidden treasure is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, is indeed focused on the protection and preservation of ancient monuments and structures. However, it does indirectly touch upon the regulation of antiquities trade by prohibiting damage or unauthorized removal of artifacts from protected sites.  While not its primary focus, the Act does play a role in controlling the antiquities market by safeguarding the artifacts within its purview. The statement's claim of "minimal emphasis" is therefore somewhat misleading, as the indirect effect on trade is a significant aspect of its enforcement.


**2. With reference to the legal framework surrounding the protection of Indian cultural heritage, consider the following statements:**

1. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947,  solely restricts the export of antiquities, without addressing their domestic protection or preservation.
2. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act, 1951, only declares specific sites as nationally important, without providing any mechanisms for their protection or management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act, 1947, while primarily focused on regulating the export of antiquities, indirectly contributes to their domestic protection. By controlling the export market, it discourages illegal excavation and trafficking within the country, thereby safeguarding the nation's heritage.  The act's provisions regarding permits and licensing also indirectly impact domestic preservation efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act, 1951,  not only declares sites as nationally important but also establishes mechanisms for their protection and management. The Act empowers the government to take steps to preserve these sites, including prohibiting damage, unauthorized alterations, and excavation.  It lays the groundwork for a comprehensive approach to site preservation and management.


**3. With reference to the Constitution of India and its impact on state finances, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India explicitly details the precise procedures for the State Governments to obtain loan consent from the Central Government.
2. The Constitution of India mandates that all state governments must seek the consent of the Central Government before taking any loan, regardless of the source of funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Constitution of India addresses the borrowing powers of states (Article 293), it doesn't prescribe a detailed, step-by-step procedure for obtaining Central Government loan consent.  The specifics of this process are largely governed by administrative guidelines and inter-governmental agreements. The Constitution sets broad parameters, but the exact mechanisms are not explicitly detailed.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Constitution doesn't mandate that all state government loans require Central Government consent.  States have the power to borrow (subject to restrictions), and while the Central Government plays a significant role in regulating state borrowing, it doesn't have blanket veto power over all loans.  The extent of Central Government involvement varies depending on the loan's source and purpose.


**4. With reference to the judicial system established by the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly defines the organizational structure and jurisdictions of all High Courts with absolute uniformity across states.
2.  The establishment of all courts in India, including High Courts, is explicitly mandated and detailed in the Constitution of India, leaving no room for legislative discretion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does establish High Courts (Article 214), defining their basic structure and powers. However, it doesn't prescribe a completely uniform organizational structure and jurisdiction for all High Courts across states.  The specific jurisdictions and internal organization of High Courts are subject to legislative action and can vary based on the specific needs and circumstances of different states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution establishes the Supreme Court and empowers the Parliament to establish other courts (Article 246). While the Constitution provides the framework for the judicial system, the specifics of establishing various courts are often left to legislative action.   The Parliament and state legislatures have considerable authority in establishing and defining the structure and jurisdiction of courts below the High Courts.  Therefore, the claim of "no room for legislative discretion" is inaccurate.


**5. With reference to the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India originally included only 14 languages, with subsequent amendments adding more.
2. The Constitution of India grants the power to choose an official language exclusively to the Central Government, with no role for individual Indian states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Eighth Schedule, originally containing 14 languages, has been amended over time to include additional languages recognized as official languages of India. This reflects the evolving linguistic landscape of the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Constitution designates Hindi as the official language of the Union, it also empowers individual states to choose their official languages.  The Constitution recognizes the linguistic diversity of India and allows states to adopt their preferred languages for official purposes within their respective jurisdictions.  Therefore, the statement's assertion that the Central Government holds exclusive power is inaccurate.  The power is shared, with states having considerable autonomy in this matter.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Women (NCW):**

1. The NCW is a constitutional body established to safeguard women's rights and review existing legal frameworks.
2. The NCW's mandate includes reviewing only the legal safeguards provided to women, excluding constitutional safeguards.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCW is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was established by an act of Parliament, not by the Constitution itself.  While it works towards the advancement of women's rights and reviews legal safeguards, its establishment is not directly rooted in the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCW's mandate explicitly includes reviewing both constitutional and legal safeguards for women.  Its role is to examine the effectiveness of all existing mechanisms, whether derived from the Constitution or from legislation, that protect and promote women's rights.  The statement's limitation of its review to legal safeguards alone is inaccurate.


**7. With reference to the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Seventh Schedule exclusively deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha.
2.  The Seventh Schedule details the distribution of subjects under three lists—Union List, State List, and Concurrent List—but does not include any provisions related to the administration of tribal areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule does *not* deal with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha.  The allocation of Rajya Sabha seats is dealt with separately in the Constitution. The Seventh Schedule focuses on the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The Seventh Schedule does primarily outline the distribution of legislative powers among the three lists (Union, State, and Concurrent).  However, the administration of tribal areas is addressed under other Constitutional provisions (like the Fifth and Sixth Schedules), not within the Seventh Schedule itself.  The statement's claim that the Seventh Schedule holds *no* provisions related to tribal areas is therefore accurate in the sense that it doesn't directly address them.


**8. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC's Chairperson and members are appointed by the President of India for a term of five years.
2. The NCSC's members can be appointed for more than two terms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NCSC is established under Article 338 of the Constitution, the Chairperson and members are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  Their term is six years, not three years.  The statement's inaccuracies regarding both the appointing authority and the term length make it incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the initial appointment is for a specific term (six years), the members of the NCSC are eligible for reappointment, and it is possible for them to serve for more than two terms.


**9. With reference to the Chief Justice of India (CJI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CJI is appointed by the Prime Minister of India under Article 124 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The CJI can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CJI is appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister, under Article 124 of the Constitution.  The statement's misidentification of the appointing authority makes it incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While removal of the CJI requires a rigorous process involving Parliament, it's not solely through impeachment. The process involves a motion passed by both Houses of Parliament, but not precisely an impeachment proceeding in the strict sense.  The grounds for removal are "proved misbehavior or incapacity," and the process involves consultation with the Supreme Court.


**10. With reference to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDMA is a constitutional body established under Article 355 of the Constitution of India.
2. The NDMA is headed by the Vice President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDMA is a statutory body, established under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, not a constitutional body established by a specific article. Article 355 deals with the Union's duty to protect states against external aggression and internal disturbance, a different subject matter.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NDMA is headed by the Prime Minister of India, not the Vice President.  The statement's misidentification of the head of the NDMA renders it incorrect.


**11. With reference to ‘Arbitration and Conciliation’, consider the following statements:**

1. Conciliation is a legally binding process, similar to arbitration.
2. Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution that is always non-binding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Conciliation is a non-binding process where a neutral third party assists in reaching a mutually agreeable settlement.  Unlike arbitration, a conciliation agreement is not legally enforceable unless it is converted into a legally binding contract.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Arbitration is a legally binding form of alternative dispute resolution.  An arbitration award is generally enforceable as a court judgment.  The statement incorrectly characterizes arbitration as always non-binding.


**12. With reference to the Election Expenditure Limit in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The election expenditure limit for Lok Sabha constituencies is uniform across all states.
2. There are strict limits on the expenditure of political parties during elections, similar to those applied to candidates.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The election expenditure limit for Lok Sabha constituencies varies based on factors like the state's size and other relevant criteria.  It is not uniform across all states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While there are limits on individual candidate spending, there are no similar, equally stringent limits on the expenditure of political parties during elections.  The regulation of party spending is a complex area with ongoing debates and reforms.

**1. With reference to the Representation of the People Act, 1950, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act exclusively defines the qualifications for voters in Lok Sabha elections, leaving the qualifications for State Legislative Assembly elections to be determined by individual state laws.
2.  The Act mandates the Election Commission of India to prepare and maintain electoral rolls for all elections, including Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Representation of the People Act, 1950, is a crucial piece of legislation that governs the conduct of elections to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.  However, statement 1 is incorrect because the Act's provisions on voter qualifications apply to both Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assembly elections. While states have some leeway in implementing these provisions, the basic framework is laid down by the Act itself.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the Act does deal with the preparation and maintenance of electoral rolls, it's primarily the responsibility of the Election Commission of India (ECI) under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and not 1950. The 1950 Act primarily deals with the allocation of seats and the delimitation of constituencies.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.  The ECI's role in electoral roll preparation is a key aspect of the electoral process, but its constitutional basis and detailed procedures are primarily found in the 1951 Act, which is complementary legislation to the 1950 Act.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP):**

1.  Article 41 of the DPSPs guarantees the right to work, education, and public assistance, making it a justiciable right enforceable in courts.
2.  The DPSPs, enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution, provide a framework for social and economic justice, but their implementation is not legally binding on the state.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) are a significant part of the Indian Constitution, outlining the social and economic goals the state should strive to achieve.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while Article 41 of the DPSPs speaks of the right to work, education, and public assistance, these are not justiciable rights.  This means they cannot be directly enforced in courts like Fundamental Rights.  The courts have consistently held that DPSPs are non-justiciable.  Statement 2 is correct. DPSPs serve as guidelines for the state to formulate policies and programs aimed at social and economic justice, but they do not create legally enforceable rights.  The state's failure to implement them does not automatically lead to judicial intervention. The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs is a crucial distinction between them and Fundamental Rights.  This reflects the Constitution's balance between individual liberties and the state's role in social and economic development.


**3. With reference to the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CCS is a constitutional body, and its composition and functions are explicitly defined in the Constitution of India.
2.  The CCS is chaired by the President of India, and its membership includes the heads of the three armed forces.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) plays a vital role in India's national security decision-making process.  However, statement 1 is incorrect as the CCS is not a constitutional body. Its formation and functions are not explicitly laid down in the Constitution.  It's a statutory body established by the government, operating under the rules and conventions of the cabinet. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The CCS is chaired by the Prime Minister of India, not the President.  While national security concerns necessitate close collaboration between the government and the armed forces, the heads of the armed forces are not standing members of the CCS. The CCS's membership is primarily composed of key cabinet ministers responsible for defense, home affairs, finance, and external affairs.  Its decisions are crucial in matters of national security, but its structure is a matter of executive discretion, not constitutional mandate.


**4. With reference to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCBC's recommendations regarding the inclusion or exclusion of communities in the list of Backward Classes are binding on the Union Government.
2.  The NCBC was established through the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018, granting it constitutional status.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) plays a crucial role in identifying and recommending social and educational backward classes for government support. Statement 1 is incorrect because the NCBC's recommendations are advisory in nature; the Union Government retains the final authority on the inclusion or exclusion of communities in the list of Backward Classes. The government can accept, reject, or modify the NCBC's recommendations.  Statement 2 is correct. The NCBC was indeed established through the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018, which gave it constitutional status and enshrined its role in identifying and protecting the interests of backward classes.  This amendment significantly enhanced the NCBC's authority and legitimacy, but it didn't change the advisory nature of its recommendations on the list of backward classes.


**5. With reference to the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, consider the following statements:**

1. The Order empowers the Election Commission of India (ECI) to resolve disputes concerning the use of election symbols only among recognized national parties.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has never questioned the ECI's authority to resolve disputes regarding election symbols under the Order.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, is a key instrument governing the allocation and use of election symbols by political parties in India. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Order empowers the ECI to resolve disputes concerning election symbols not only among national parties but also among state and registered parties.  The ECI's role in symbol allocation and dispute resolution is broad and covers all participating parties. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Supreme Court of India has, in fact, adjudicated on the ECI's authority under the Order in several cases, upholding its validity and its role in resolving symbol disputes. The Supreme Court's involvement underscores the importance of ensuring fairness and impartiality in election symbol allocation and the overall electoral process.  The ECI's authority in this area is a crucial aspect of a free and fair election.


**6. With reference to oath-taking ceremonies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The wording of the oath of office for the Chief Minister of a state is different from that of a Union Minister.
2. The Chief Justice of India administers the oath of office to the President of India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Oath-taking ceremonies are formal events signifying the assumption of office by various constitutional functionaries in India. Statement 1 is correct.  While both the Chief Minister and a Union Minister take oaths of office, the specific wording of their oaths differs slightly, reflecting their distinct constitutional roles and responsibilities within their respective spheres of governance. The differences in wording reflect the distinct constitutional positions and the different levels of governance. Statement 2 is also correct.  The Chief Justice of India, as the head of the judiciary, administers the oath of office to the President of India, marking the commencement of the President's term. This reflects the judiciary's role as an independent and impartial arbiter, ensuring the smooth transition of power. The Chief Justice's role in administering the oath signifies the judiciary's independence and its crucial role in upholding the Constitution.


**7. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under the Indian Constitution.
2. The Chairperson of the NHRC is appointed by the President of India based on the recommendations of a committee headed by the Prime Minister.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a crucial institution in India's human rights protection framework. Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, established by an Act of Parliament (Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993), not a constitutional body.  Its establishment is a legislative act, not a constitutional mandate, though its functions align with constitutional principles of human rights. Statement 2 is correct.  The President of India appoints the Chairperson and members of the NHRC based on the recommendations of a six-member committee headed by the Prime Minister.  This committee's composition reflects the importance of consensus and multi-party involvement in the selection of this key human rights institution's leadership. The Prime Minister-headed committee underscores the importance of the executive's role in upholding human rights, but the final appointing authority is the President.


**8.  With reference to the appointment of the Chief Justice of India (CJI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India lays down a specific procedure for the appointment of the CJI.
2.  Seniority at the Supreme Court is determined solely by the age of the judge.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The appointment of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is a significant constitutional process.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not prescribe a specific procedure for the appointment of the CJI. The convention is that the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court is appointed CJI.  However, this convention is not legally binding, and the government retains the ultimate authority in the appointment process.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. Seniority at the Supreme Court is not determined solely by age.  While age is a factor, the primary determinant of seniority is the date of appointment to the Supreme Court.  In case of simultaneous appointments, other factors like the date of swearing-in as a judge and years of High Court service are considered. This complex system of seniority ensures that judicial experience and competence are also valued in determining the hierarchy within the Supreme Court.


**9. With reference to the Standing Committee on Defence, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee's membership includes members nominated from both Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha).
2.  The Committee was constituted for the first time in the year 2000.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Standing Committee on Defence is a crucial parliamentary committee overseeing the Ministry of Defence.  Statement 1 is correct. The Committee's membership comprises members nominated from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, ensuring representation from both houses of Parliament. This ensures a wider perspective on defence matters and enhances parliamentary oversight.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Committee on Defence was first constituted in 1993, not in 2000.  The establishment of this committee in 1993 marked a significant step in enhancing parliamentary scrutiny over the defence budget and policies.  The committee's composition and functions are governed by the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.


**10. With reference to Public Interest Litigation (PIL), consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of PIL originated in India in the 1970s.
2.  Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer and Justice P.N. Bhagwati played significant roles in the evolution of PIL in India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has significantly expanded access to justice for marginalized groups in India. Statement 1 is incorrect. While PIL gained prominence in India during the 1980s, its roots can be traced to the United States in the 1960s. The Indian judiciary adapted and evolved the concept to suit the Indian context. Statement 2 is correct.  Justices V.R. Krishna Iyer and P.N. Bhagwati were instrumental in shaping and expanding the scope of PIL in India. Their landmark judgments broadened the understanding of who could file PILs and what issues they could address, significantly impacting the reach and effectiveness of the Indian judicial system. Their contributions broadened the access to justice for the marginalized.


**11. With reference to the National Commission for Women (NCW), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCW is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The NCW's primary function is to review and recommend remedial legislative measures concerning women's rights.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Women (NCW) is a vital institution for women's rights in India. Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCW is a statutory body established under the National Commission for Women Act, 1990, not a constitutional body.  Its existence and functions are defined by legislation, not directly by the Constitution, although its mandate aligns with constitutional principles of gender equality.  Statement 2 is correct. The NCW's core functions include reviewing constitutional and legal safeguards for women, recommending legislative measures, facilitating redressal of grievances, and advising the government on policy matters affecting women.  The NCW's role in recommending legislative changes is crucial to the ongoing evolution of women's rights in India.


**12. With reference to the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Seventh Schedule contains three lists: Union List, State List, and Residuary List.
2.  In case of conflict between a Union law and a State law on a subject in the Concurrent List, the State law prevails.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution is crucial for understanding the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule contains three lists: Union List, State List, and Concurrent List; there is no Residuary List. The residuary powers, those not explicitly mentioned in the Union or State lists, are vested in the Union Government under Article 248 of the Constitution.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. In case of conflict between a Union law and a State law on a subject in the Concurrent List, the Union law prevails. This reflects the principle of federalism with a strong Centre, ensuring uniformity in matters of national importance. The principle of overriding power of the union government is a key aspect of India's federal structure.


**13. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a statutory body established under Article 338 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Prime Minister of India appoints the Chairperson and members of the NCSC.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) is a crucial body protecting the rights of Scheduled Castes in India. Statement 1 is correct. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Indian Constitution.  This constitutional basis gives it significant authority and legitimacy in addressing issues of discrimination and injustice against Scheduled Castes.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President of India, not the Prime Minister, appoints the Chairperson and members of the NCSC.  The President's role in this appointment reflects the importance of the highest office in the country in ensuring the commission's independence and impartiality.  The presidential appointment reflects the constitutional significance of this body.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India appoints the Chief Justice of India (CJI) based on a clearly defined procedure laid out in the Indian Constitution.
2.  The President of India enjoys absolute veto power over all bills passed by Parliament, including Money Bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not prescribe a specific procedure for appointing the CJI.  The process relies on convention and established practice, primarily involving consultation with the outgoing CJI and other senior judges (Collegium system). The President acts on the recommendation of the Collegium, but the Constitution itself doesn't dictate the method.  Therefore, the statement about a clearly defined constitutional procedure is false.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the President possesses significant veto power (including absolute veto, suspensive veto, and pocket veto), this power is not absolute in the case of Money Bills.  Article 111 of the Constitution grants the President the power to assent to or withhold assent to bills, but concerning Money Bills, the President's power is limited to returning the bill for reconsideration. If the Parliament passes the bill again, the President is bound to assent.  Therefore, the claim of absolute veto power over all bills, including Money Bills, is inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can pardon death sentences only after consulting with the Council of Ministers and obtaining their explicit approval.
2.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment is limited to offenses against Union laws and excludes offenses under state laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, including death sentences. While the President typically acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers,  the Constitution does not mandate this consultation for every pardon, especially in cases of death sentences. The President retains the discretion to act independently in such matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, etc., in cases where the sentence is by a court-martial or for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  It also includes the power to pardon death sentences. While many cases involve Union laws, the President's power isn't strictly limited to them. The scope of the President's power is broader than just offenses against Union laws.


**3. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 263 empowers the President to establish an Inter-State Council to resolve disputes between states, but only if the Parliament passes a separate law authorizing its creation.
2.  The President of India is an integral part of the Parliament, participating directly in the legislative process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 263 of the Constitution authorizes the President to establish an Inter-State Council. However, the actual establishment and functioning of the council are contingent upon a separate law passed by the Parliament. The President's role is limited to authorizing the creation of the council, not dictating its function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President of India is the Head of State, not the Head of Government. While the President is part of Parliament (for example, addressing joint sessions), the President does not directly participate in the legislative process.  The President's role is primarily ceremonial, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers for most executive and legislative actions. The legislative process is primarily the domain of Parliament.


**4. With reference to the Prime Minister of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President of India solely on the basis of the majority party's strength in the Lok Sabha, without any other considerations.
2.  The Prime Minister chairs the NITI Aayog, but the appointment of its Vice-Chairperson requires the President's approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister is typically the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha, the President's role in appointing the Prime Minister is not solely based on this factor. The President considers various factors, including the possibility of forming a stable government, before inviting someone to form the government.  The Constitution doesn't explicitly state the process, leading to conventions and established practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister chairs the NITI Aayog, and the Vice-Chairperson is appointed by the President. Although the Prime Minister recommends the Vice-Chairperson, the final appointment rests with the President.  Therefore, the President's approval is necessary for the Vice-Chairperson's appointment.


**5. With reference to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDMA is headed by the President of India, reflecting the highest level of national commitment to disaster management.
2. The NDMA's functions include developing crowd management strategies and regulating chemical disaster management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDMA is headed by the Prime Minister of India, not the President. This reflects the executive's role in coordinating disaster response. The President's role is primarily ceremonial.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NDMA's responsibilities encompass a wide range of disaster management activities.  Developing crowd management strategies and regulating chemical disaster management are part of its mandate to create a holistic and integrated approach to disaster management in India.  The NDMA's role in coordinating disaster preparedness and response is crucial.


**6. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1. Lok Adalats are established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, and aim to resolve disputes amicably through mediation, primarily focusing on pre-litigation disputes.
2.  The Lok Adalat's decisions are binding and enforceable like court judgments, but appeals against them lie directly with the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lok Adalats are established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. They aim to settle disputes amicably through mediation and conciliation.  While they can handle cases at the pre-litigation stage, they also address pending cases in courts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Lok Adalat decisions are binding and enforceable as court decrees. However, appeals against their decisions are typically heard by the High Courts, not directly by the Supreme Court.  The jurisdiction of appeal depends on the nature of the case and specific provisions within the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, defines arbitration as a form of alternative dispute resolution where a neutral third party imposes a non-binding decision.
2.  Conciliation is a voluntary process where a neutral third party facilitates communication and negotiation between disputing parties, but lacks the power to impose a decision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, defines arbitration as a form of alternative dispute resolution where a neutral third party (arbitrator) makes a *binding* decision, not a non-binding one. This is a key difference between arbitration and other ADR mechanisms like mediation or conciliation.  The arbitrator's decision is legally enforceable.

Statement 2 is correct. Conciliation is a voluntary process aimed at helping disputing parties reach a mutually agreeable settlement. The conciliator acts as a facilitator, assisting communication and negotiation but lacks the authority to impose a decision.  The parties retain control over the outcome.


**8. With reference to the Election Expenditure Limit in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) sets the election expenditure limits for Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly constituencies, but these limits do not apply to political parties.
2.  The election expenditure limit for Lok Sabha constituencies is uniformly ₹95 lakh across all states, regardless of size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ECI sets election expenditure limits for Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly constituencies. However,  crucially, there are no limits on the expenditure of political parties themselves during elections. This distinction is important because parties can indirectly influence spending through various means.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The election expenditure limit for Lok Sabha constituencies varies depending on the size of the state.  Larger states have a higher limit (₹95 lakh in the given example) than smaller states (₹75 lakh in the given example). This differentiation is based on the assumption that campaigning costs vary with the geographical size and population of the constituency.


**9. With reference to the removal of a Supreme Court Judge, consider the following statements:**

1. A Supreme Court Judge can be removed from office only by the President of India, without any involvement of Parliament.
2. The grounds for removal of a Supreme Court Judge are proved misbehavior or incapacity, and the President must act only after receiving addresses from both Houses of Parliament supporting the removal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President of India passes the final order removing a Supreme Court Judge, this action is not independent of Parliament.  Article 124(4) stipulates that a judge can be removed only by an order of the President *after* each House of Parliament presents an address supported by a majority of its total membership and at least two-thirds of the members present and voting.  Parliament's role is thus crucial in the removal process.

Statement 2 is correct. The grounds for removal are explicitly stated as "proved misbehavior or incapacity." The President's action is contingent upon receiving addresses from both Houses of Parliament, indicating the need for a parliamentary process to initiate removal proceedings.  This safeguards against arbitrary removal of judges.


**10. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Chairperson and members of the NCSC are appointed by the Prime Minister of India for a term of five years.
2.  Members of the NCSC can be reappointed for a maximum of two consecutive terms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairperson and members of the NCSC are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  The President's role highlights the importance of this constitutional body.  The term length is also three years, not five.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Members of the NCSC hold office for a term of three years and are not eligible for more than two terms. The limitation on the number of terms prevents undue influence or prolonged tenure in a single position.  This ensures a degree of rotation and fresh perspectives within the commission.


**11. With reference to the atmospheric rivers, consider the following statements:**

1. Atmospheric rivers are narrow bands of concentrated water vapor that transport moisture from higher latitudes towards the tropics.
2. Atmospheric rivers, upon making landfall, can cause heavy rainfall and flooding, especially in coastal areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Atmospheric rivers transport moisture from the tropics towards higher latitudes, not the other way around.  They act as conduits, moving significant amounts of water vapor from warmer regions to colder ones. This movement is a crucial part of the global water cycle.

Statement 2 is correct.  Atmospheric rivers are significant weather phenomena.  When they make landfall, they can deliver immense amounts of moisture, leading to heavy rainfall and potentially devastating floods, particularly in coastal regions. The concentrated nature of the water vapor makes them potent sources of precipitation.


**12. With reference to the Arun River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arun River is a transboundary river originating in Tibet and flowing through Nepal and India, but it is not known as the Yaluzangbu in Tibet.
2. The Arun River is a tributary of the Kosi River.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Arun River is a transboundary river originating in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It flows through Nepal and finally joins the Kosi River in India.  In Tibet, it is known as the Yarlung Tsangpo.  The statement is slightly misleading by stating that it is not known as the Yaluzangbu in Tibet, but the correct name is Yarlung Tsangpo.

Statement 2 is correct. The Arun River is a significant tributary of the Kosi River. The Kosi River itself is a major river system flowing through Nepal and India. The Arun River contributes substantially to the Kosi's water volume.


**13. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Amazon River is the world's longest river by length, surpassing the Nile River.
2. The Amazon River's watershed encompasses a large area, spanning several South American countries, with the majority of its main stream located in Brazil.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nile River is considered the longest river in the world by length, while the Amazon River is the largest by volume. The debate regarding the exact lengths of these rivers is ongoing, due to measurement difficulties, but the Nile generally holds the title of longest.

Statement 2 is correct. The Amazon River's drainage basin is vast, covering parts of Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Bolivia. A significant portion of the main Amazon River flows through Brazil.


**14. With reference to the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar, consider the following statements:**

1. Both Falkland Islands and Gibraltar are overseas territories of the United Kingdom.
2. The Falkland Islands are located in the Atlantic Ocean, while Gibraltar is situated in the Indian Ocean.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar are overseas territories of the United Kingdom.  This reflects the UK's historical colonial legacy and its continued control over these territories, despite ongoing sovereignty disputes in some cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Falkland Islands are located in the South Atlantic Ocean, while Gibraltar is situated on the Iberian Peninsula at the southern tip of Spain.  The statement incorrectly places Gibraltar in the Indian Ocean.


**15. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Congo Basin contains the world's largest tropical rainforest, exceeding the Amazon in size.
2. The Congo Basin plays a crucial role in global carbon sequestration, acting as one of the world’s largest carbon sinks, but not the largest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**9. With reference to the Vadhvan Port Project in Maharashtra, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vadhvan Port project, situated near Dahanu in Palghar district, is envisioned to become India’s 14th major port, significantly expanding India's maritime trade capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that the Vadhvan Port project is set to become India's 13th major port, not the 14th.  While it aims to significantly bolster India’s trade capacity, the number of existing major ports is a specific fact that needs to be correctly recalled.

Statement 2 is correct. This accurately describes the joint venture between JNPA and MMB, specifying the 74% stake held by JNPA in the SPV.  The details of the partnership structure are important for understanding the project's governance.


**10. With reference to Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Located approximately 90 kilometers southwest of Jaipur, Sambhar Lake is India's largest inland salt lake, recognized as a Ramsar site since 1980.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sambhar Lake is indeed India's largest inland salt lake and is a Ramsar site, the year of its recognition as such is incorrect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text indicates the Coral Triangle spans over 10 million square kilometers.  The inclusion of Singapore is also incorrect; it is included in the region. The precise area and the inclusion/exclusion of specific countries are crucial details.

Statement 2 is correct. The statement accurately reflects the Coral Triangle's high coral diversity (76% of world's coral species) and its significant contribution to the livelihoods of coastal populations (over 120 million people).  The figures provided are close enough to the actual data to be considered correct for the purpose of this question.


**12. With reference to the  Paracel Islands, consider the following statements:**

1.  Triton Island, the closest landmass in the Paracel archipelago to Vietnam, has witnessed a recent significant military buildup by Taiwan, escalating tensions in the South China Sea.
2.  The Paracel Islands are claimed by China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, with China basing its claim on the "Nine-Dash Line," a contested maritime demarcation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that China, not Taiwan, is responsible for the military buildup on Triton Island. The attribution of the buildup to the wrong country is a significant factual error.

Statement 2 is correct. This statement accurately describes the territorial claims over the Paracel Islands and China's reliance on the contested Nine-Dash Line to justify its claim. This is a well-known geopolitical issue.


**13. With reference to Chad, consider the following statements:**

1. Chad, a landlocked country in North Africa, is bordered by Libya to the north, Niger to the west, and Nigeria to the south, among other countries.
2.  The recent attack on a military base in Chad's eastern Barkaram region resulted in the deaths of at least 50 soldiers, highlighting the ongoing security challenges in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text accurately describes Chad's geographical location and its bordering countries. The description of Chad’s location and its neighbors is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text reports at least 40 soldiers died, not 50. The number of casualties is a specific detail.  While the statement correctly identifies the location of the attack and alludes to security challenges, the inaccurate casualty figure makes the statement incorrect.


**14. With reference to BharatGen, consider the following statements:**

1. BharatGen is an initiative focused on developing multilingual AI models to promote India's linguistic diversity, but it primarily focuses on text-based models.
2.  It is launched under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS) of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  BharatGen focuses on *multilingual and multimodal* AI models, not primarily on text-based models.  The omission of the multimodal aspect misrepresents the project's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that BharatGen is launched under the NM-ICPS of the Department of Science and Technology, not the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The ministry responsible is a crucial detail.


**15. With reference to Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan is a national campaign to rehabilitate homeless and destitute persons, offering them skills training and employment opportunities.
2. This campaign, launched in 2022, aims to provide comprehensive support to manual scavengers, including financial assistance and alternative livelihood options.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan focuses on eradicating manual scavenging, not primarily on rehabilitating homeless and destitute persons.  The focus is misrepresented.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the campaign aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers, the provided text doesn't specify a launch year of 2022. The launch date and the precise focus are not correctly represented.  The question plays on the similar nature of the two statements to confuse the examinee.


**16. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), consider the following statements:**

1. SBM (Urban) was launched in 2014 with the goal of achieving universal sanitation coverage by 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The scheme targets approximately 63,000 villages, not 73,000, and its duration is 5 years, not 7.  The number of villages and the duration are specific, easily verifiable facts.

Statement 2 is correct. The use of the PM GatiShakti portal for monitoring is a key feature of the scheme's implementation.


**18. Consider the following statements with reference to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme:**

1. PM-KISAN, launched in 2019, is a centrally sponsored scheme providing financial assistance to small and marginal farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PM-KISAN was indeed launched in 2019 and is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at supporting small and marginal farmers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The annual amount transferred is ₹6000, not ₹7000, and it's disbursed in three, not four, equal installments.  The exact amount and the number of installments are crucial details.


**19. With reference to Assam's Co-Districts initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. Co-Districts are sub-district administrative units headed by an officer with the rank of Deputy Commissioner, aimed at decentralized governance.
2. The primary goal is to improve service delivery by bringing administration closer to the people, thereby enhancing local governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Co-Districts are headed by an Assistant District Commissioner, not a Deputy Commissioner. The rank of the officer is a key detail in understanding the initiative’s structure. The statement also incorrectly claims that the aim is *decentralized* governance when it is in fact aimed at improving the existing centralized governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The initiative's core objective is to enhance service delivery by bringing administration closer to the people.  This accurately reflects the aim of the Co-Districts initiative.


**20.  With reference to the Prakash Tandon Committee and the Sam Pitroda Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prakash Tandon Committee focused on reforms in the Indian Railways, proposing structural changes and efficiency improvements.
2. The Sam Pitroda Committee primarily dealt with civil service reforms, recommending modernization and technological upgrades.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While committees related to railway reforms have existed, the provided text doesn't explicitly state the Prakash Tandon Committee was focused on railway reforms.  The text doesn't specify what the Prakash Tandon committee was about.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While committees focused on civil service reforms exist, the provided text doesn't link the Sam Pitroda Committee to this specific area.  The text doesn't specify what the Sam Pitroda committee was about. The question relies on the examinee's knowledge of the committees.


**21. Consider the following statements with reference to the Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY):**

1. NPY is a centrally sponsored scheme under the National Health Mission providing nutritional support to all tuberculosis patients.
2.  The scheme's primary objective is to improve the nutritional status of tuberculosis patients, thereby aiding in their recovery and reducing treatment dropout rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NPY is a *central sector* scheme, not centrally sponsored, under the National Health Mission.  The funding mechanism is a key distinction. Also, it doesn't necessarily cover *all* TB patients, depending on criteria.

Statement 2 is correct. Improving the nutritional status of TB patients to improve recovery rates and reduce treatment dropout is a core objective of the NPY.


**22. With reference to Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY), consider the following statements:**

1. AB PM-JAY provides health coverage of ₹5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization.
2. Beneficiaries can avail cashless treatment only in empaneled public hospitals across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  AB PM-JAY provides health cover of ₹5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization.  The coverage amount and the type of care covered are key features.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Beneficiaries can access cashless treatment in *empaneled public or private* hospitals, not only public hospitals. The inclusion/exclusion of private hospitals is a crucial detail.

**1. With reference to the Atal Pension Yojana (APY), consider the following statements:**

1.  The APY provides a guaranteed minimum pension of ₹5,000 per month after the age of 60, regardless of contribution amount.
2.  Eligibility for APY is limited to individuals who are enrolled in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While APY does provide a guaranteed minimum pension after age 60, the amount varies depending on the contribution tier chosen by the subscriber and is not a fixed ₹5,000. The minimum pension amount ranges from ₹1,000 to ₹5,000 per month.  The statement misrepresents the flexibility of the pension amount based on contribution levels.  It incorrectly presents a fixed pension amount irrespective of contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PMJDY account holders are encouraged to participate in APY and it can simplify the enrollment process by providing a pre-existing bank account,  APY eligibility is not exclusively limited to PMJDY account holders. Any Indian citizen between the ages of 18 and 40 who is not a member of any other defined contribution pension scheme can join APY. The statement creates a false restriction on eligibility.  The connection between PMJDY and APY is one of convenience, not a prerequisite.


**2. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers is responsible for the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) scheme, which provides subsidized generic drugs.
2.  The AMD-CF Scheme, under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, focuses solely on providing financial assistance for the establishment of new medical device manufacturing units.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers is indeed the administering ministry for the PMBJP scheme.  This scheme aims to make quality generic medicines available at affordable prices through a network of Jan Aushadhi Kendras. The statement accurately reflects the ministry's role and the scheme's objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Assistance to Medical Device Clusters for Common Facilities (AMD-CF) Scheme, while under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, does not solely focus on establishing *new* medical device manufacturing units.  It also supports the strengthening of existing clusters and the creation of common facilities to improve the overall manufacturing capacity and quality within these clusters. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate depiction of the scheme's scope.  It omits the crucial aspect of supporting existing facilities.


**3. With reference to the “Samarth” scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Samarth scheme, launched by the Ministry of Textiles, exclusively focuses on upskilling programs for workers already employed in the textile sector.
2. The Samarth scheme provides financial assistance to textile entrepreneurs for setting up new businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Samarth scheme, under the Ministry of Textiles, is primarily focused on capacity building within the existing textile workforce.  It aims to enhance the skills and productivity of existing workers through various reskilling and upskilling initiatives. The statement correctly identifies the scheme's core objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Samarth scheme does not directly provide financial assistance to textile entrepreneurs for starting new businesses. Its focus is on improving the capabilities of the existing workforce to enhance the competitiveness and productivity of the entire textile sector. The statement wrongly attributes a financial assistance function to the scheme.  It confuses Samarth's focus on human capital development with financial support for new ventures.


**4. With reference to the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN, consider the following statements:**

1.  UDAN was launched in 2017 with the primary aim of connecting major metropolitan cities through a network of smaller regional airports.
2.  The scheme provides Viability Gap Funding (VGF) solely to private airline operators to incentivize them to operate on underserved routes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) was launched in 2016, not 2017.  Its primary aim is to connect underserved and unserved areas, not solely major metropolitan cities.  The first flight took off in 2017, but the scheme itself was launched a year earlier. The statement contains an error in the launch year and misrepresents the scheme's target areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While UDAN does provide VGF to incentivize operations on underserved routes, it is not exclusively limited to private airline operators. Public sector airlines can also receive VGF under the scheme. The statement wrongly restricts the beneficiaries of VGF to only private operators.  It overlooks the participation of public sector airlines.


**5. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMBJP provides free medicines to all citizens through dedicated Jan Aushadhi Kendras.
2.  The Pharma & Medical Bureau of India (PMBI) is responsible for the procurement and quality control of medicines under the PMBJP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PMBJP does not provide medicines *free of cost*. It provides quality generic medicines at significantly subsidized rates compared to branded medicines. The statement misrepresents the pricing model of the scheme. It incorrectly claims free distribution of medicines.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Bureau of India (PMBI) plays a crucial role in the procurement, quality control, and distribution of medicines under the PMBJP.  The statement accurately reflects PMBI's key responsibilities within the scheme.


**6. Consider the following statements with reference to Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY):**

1.  PMMY provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate small and micro enterprises.
2.  PMMY offers loans in three categories: ‘Shishu’, ‘Kishore’, and ‘Tarun’.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMMY does provide loans to non-corporate small and micro enterprises, the loan amount limit is up to ₹50 lakh, not ₹10 lakh. The statement underestimates the maximum loan amount offered under the scheme. It significantly understates the credit limit provided.

Statement 2 is correct. PMMY indeed categorizes its loans into three segments: ‘Shishu’ (loans up to ₹50,000), ‘Kishore’ (loans between ₹50,001 and ₹5 lakh), and ‘Tarun’ (loans between ₹5,00,001 and ₹10 lakh). The statement correctly identifies the three loan categories.


**7. With reference to the PM-YASASVI Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM-YASASVI Scheme primarily aims to provide vocational training to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
2. The scheme provides financial assistance exclusively for higher education to students from rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PM-YASASVI does support skill development, its primary objective is broader than just vocational training.  It focuses on providing holistic educational support and skill development for socially and economically disadvantaged students, encompassing various aspects of education and skill-building. The statement narrows down the scheme's objective too much.  It misses the comprehensive nature of the support provided.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM-YASASVI Scheme does not limit its financial assistance exclusively to higher education or students from rural areas. It offers support across various levels of education and to students from diverse backgrounds facing social and economic disadvantages.  The statement presents an inaccurate and restrictive view of the scheme's beneficiaries and scope.


**8.  The "YuvAI initiative for Skilling and Capacity Building" was recently launched in collaboration with:**

(a) Meta, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and NITI Aayog
(b) Meta, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)
(c) Microsoft, Ministry of Education, and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)
(d) Google, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), and NITI Aayog

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the YuvAI initiative is a collaboration between Meta, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).  This partnership leverages Meta's expertise in artificial intelligence and technology to enhance skilling and capacity building initiatives within the Indian education and technology sectors, aligning with MeitY's and AICTE's goals. The other options present incorrect collaborations.


**9. With reference to the Civil Registration System (CRS) mobile application, consider the following statements:**

1. The app is designed to facilitate the registration of births and deaths, simplifying the process for citizens.
2.  The app is launched by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to improve data collection for health planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Civil Registration System (CRS) mobile application aims to streamline the registration of vital events like births and deaths, making the process more accessible and efficient for citizens.  The statement accurately reflects the app's primary function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While improved data collection aids health planning, the CRS app is not launched by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. It falls under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which is responsible for the overall civil registration system in India. The statement misattributes the launching ministry. It incorrectly identifies the responsible ministry.


**10. Which state government has recently launched the Rajya Vishisht Yojana to mitigate stubble burning incidents?**

(a) Delhi
(b) Punjab
(c) Uttar Pradesh
(d) Haryana

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rajya Vishisht Yojana is a Punjab government initiative aimed at reducing stubble burning. The program focuses on providing farmers with alternative methods for managing crop residue, thus reducing air pollution caused by stubble burning.  The other options are incorrect as they do not implement this specific scheme.  The question tests factual knowledge of state-level environmental initiatives.

**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JAY provides health coverage of ₹5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization, including up to 15 days of post-hospitalization expenses.
2.  Eligibility for PM-JAY is solely based on the Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) data, excluding families previously covered under the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. PM-JAY does offer a health cover of ₹5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization.  It also includes pre and post-hospitalization expenses, though the post-hospitalization period is 15 days, as stated in the prompt.  The slight discrepancy doesn't invalidate the core accuracy of the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While SECC 2011 data forms a significant basis for household inclusion in PM-JAY, it's explicitly mentioned in the source that the scheme *also* includes families covered under RSBY but missing from the SECC 2011 database. This demonstrates that eligibility isn't solely based on SECC 2011 data.  The exclusion of RSBY beneficiaries is factually inaccurate.  This makes option (a) the only correct choice.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2. The question tests the candidate's ability to carefully analyze nuanced information and avoid making oversimplifications based on partial information.


**2. With reference to the Atal Pension Yojana (APY), consider the following statements:**

1. APY provides a guaranteed pension of Rs. 1000, Rs. 2000, Rs. 3000, Rs. 4000, or Rs. 5000 per month after the age of 60, with contributions varying based on the chosen pension amount.  The spouse receives the full pension after the subscriber's death.
2. APY eligibility is open to all Indian citizens aged 18-40, regardless of income tax status, provided they have a bank account and are enrolled through a Common Service Centre (CSC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While APY does offer a guaranteed minimum monthly pension ranging from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 5000 after age 60, dependent on contributions, the assertion that the spouse receives the *full* pension is wrong. The source clearly states that the spouse receives 50% of the pension as a family pension after the subscriber's death. This detail is crucial and shows a lack of complete understanding of the scheme if overlooked.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The source specifies that APY eligibility is limited to bank account holders aged 18-40 who are *not* income taxpayers.  The statement incorrectly omits the income tax status requirement.  Further, while CSCs are an enrollment channel, it doesn't imply that enrollment is *exclusively* through CSCs.  The combination of inaccuracies in both statements renders option (d) the correct answer.  This question highlights the need for precise recall of eligibility criteria and benefit details.


**3. With reference to the Samarth Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Samarth Scheme, a placement-oriented initiative of the Ministry of Textiles, aims to train 10 lakh individuals in textile-related skills, excluding spinning and weaving, over its entire duration.
2.  The scheme exclusively provides upskilling/reskilling programs for existing workers in the Apparel & Garmenting segments, prioritizing women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Samarth Scheme is a demand-driven, placement-oriented program under the Ministry of Textiles, aiming to create jobs in the organized textile sector (excluding spinning and weaving), the number of trainees is not 10 lakh. The provided text states that the scheme was extended to train 3 lakh people.  A significant difference, showcasing the importance of precise numerical data.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Although the Samarth Scheme does include upskilling/reskilling for Apparel & Garmenting workers and shows a high percentage of female trainees (88.3%), it is not *exclusive* to this segment. The scheme covers the entire textile value chain (excluding spinning and weaving) and aims to provide opportunities for new entrants as well.  The exclusive nature of the statement is a critical flaw. Thus, both statements are inaccurate, leading to option (d) as the correct answer.  This question emphasizes the importance of understanding the scope and target groups of government schemes.


**4. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMY offers loans up to ₹20 lakh in four categories: Shishu, Kishore, Tarun, and Tarun Plus, targeting non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.
2.  The scheme's primary objective is to enhance financial inclusion, particularly for marginalized communities, by providing collateral-free loans exclusively through Public Sector Banks.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  PMMY does indeed offer loans up to ₹20 lakh,  with the introduction of the "Tarun Plus" category extending the loan limit.  The scheme targets non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises and categorizes loans into Shishu, Kishore, Tarun, and Tarun Plus.  The minor inaccuracy of stating four categories instead of three (before the introduction of Tarun Plus) does not render the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PMMY aims to enhance financial inclusion for marginalized communities, it doesn't restrict loan disbursement exclusively to Public Sector Banks. The scheme involves commercial banks, NBFCs, and other financial institutions.  Further, the assertion of "collateral-free loans" needs clarification; while the scheme aims for ease of access,  it doesn't guarantee completely collateral-free loans in all cases.  The inaccuracies in statement 2 make (a) the only correct option. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the financial mechanisms and reach of government schemes.


**5. With reference to the National Pension System (NPS), consider the following statements:**

1. The National Pension System (NPS) is administered by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and contributes significantly to the growth of India's pension sector.
2.  All individuals with a PMJDY account are automatically enrolled in the NPS and are eligible for the Atal Pension Yojana (APY).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NPS is indeed administered by PFRDA, and its growth significantly impacts India's pension sector. This statement reflects accurate factual information about the organization and its role.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While PMJDY account holders *can* be eligible for APY (which is a part of the NPS), they are not automatically enrolled in the NPS. APY is a separate scheme.  Automatic enrollment is not a feature of either scheme.  The incorrect implication of automatic enrollment renders the statement false.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate choice. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the relationship between different pension schemes in India.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the East Asia Summit (EAS), consider the following statements:**

1. The EAS, established in 2005, initially comprised 16 member states, expanding to its current size in 2011.
2.  The ASEAN Plus Three mechanism, a precursor to the EAS, was instrumental in its formation and involved extensive preliminary discussions in Kuala Lumpur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The EAS was indeed established in 2005. While the exact initial number of member states might vary slightly depending on the source, the key point is that it didn't start with its current membership and expanded later, aligning with the statement's core message.  The expansion to include the USA and Russia occurred in 2011, further supporting the accuracy of statement 1.

Statement 2 is also correct. The ASEAN Plus Three (APT) mechanism, involving ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea, significantly contributed to the groundwork for the EAS.  Extensive preparatory meetings and discussions under the APT framework in Kuala Lumpur laid the foundation for the EAS's eventual establishment. This demonstrates the crucial role of APT in the EAS's genesis. Therefore, the comprehensive nature of statement 2 makes it accurate.  Both statements provide factual information about the EAS's development and origins.


**2. With reference to India's participation in the East Asia Summit (EAS), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's engagement with the EAS began in 2002, coinciding with the establishment of an annual summit-level dialogue with ASEAN.
2.  The Prime Minister of India's address at the EAS in Vientiane, Laos, marked the first time an Indian Prime Minister participated in the summit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India did enhance its engagement with ASEAN to the summit level in 2002,  its formal participation in the EAS itself began later, in 2005 when the EAS was established.  The 2002 event was a separate ASEAN-India summit, not the EAS.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The provided information indicates that the Prime Minister of India has addressed the EAS multiple times, implying that Vientiane, Laos, was not the first such occasion.  The question attempts to mislead by focusing on a specific instance of participation, rather than the overall participation.

Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies related to the timeline and nature of India's involvement with the EAS.


**3. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its relationship with India, consider the following statements:**

1.  ASEAN, established in 1967, initially comprised five member states, with India becoming a founding member.
2. The ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA) agreement, signed in 2009, significantly boosted bilateral trade, surpassing USD 130 billion in recent years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ASEAN was indeed established in 1967, but it began with five founding members; India was not one of them. India's engagement with ASEAN started later, in 1992.  The statement attempts to mislead by falsely suggesting India's founding membership.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), signed in 2009 (and not AIFTA), did significantly increase bilateral trade. While the exact figure might fluctuate, the statement's core claim that trade has substantially increased and surpassed USD 130 billion in recent years is supported by the information.  It’s important to note the accurate name of the agreement.

Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the relationship between ASEAN and India.


**4. With reference to India's relations with its neighboring countries, consider the following statements:**

1. India shares its longest land border with Bangladesh, exceeding 4000 km, and has a comprehensive trade agreement with them since 2011.
2.  India's shortest border is with Afghanistan, measuring less than 100 km, and the bilateral relations are characterized by strong security cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  India does share its longest land border with Bangladesh. Although the exact length might vary slightly depending on the source, the statement's claim is substantively true. The claim about a comprehensive trade agreement since 2011, however, is inaccurate. While trade agreements exist, the specific date and the nature of being "comprehensive" require further clarification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's shortest border is indeed with Afghanistan, but the length is closer to 100 km than less than 100km. More importantly, while India has had historically significant ties with Afghanistan, characterizing the current bilateral relationship as "strong security cooperation" is an overstatement given the current political situation in Afghanistan.

Therefore, only statement 1 is largely correct, although not entirely precise in its description of the trade agreement.


**5.  With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), headquartered in Beijing, China, facilitates intelligence sharing among member states.
2.  Belarus, Mongolia, and Afghanistan are full members of the SCO, having joined the organization in 2017.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While RATS does facilitate cooperation against terrorism, its headquarters are located in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, not Beijing, China. The statement incorrectly locates the RATS headquarters.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Belarus, Mongolia, and Afghanistan are not full members; they hold observer status.  The statement incorrectly states their membership status and the year of joining.  India and Pakistan joined as full members in 2017, but the three mentioned countries did not.

Therefore, both statements contain significant factual errors regarding the SCO's structure and membership.


**6. With reference to the BRICS grouping, consider the following statements:**

1.  The New Development Bank (NDB), established in 2015, has its headquarters in Brasilia, Brazil, and India is its largest recipient of financial support.
2. The BRICS Contingency Reserve Arrangement (CRA), established in 2012, provides short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance-of-payments crises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NDB was indeed established in 2015, its headquarters are in Shanghai, China, not Brasilia, Brazil.  While India is a significant recipient of NDB funds,  it is not the *largest* recipient; China holds that position. The statement makes two factual errors.

Statement 2 is correct.  The BRICS CRA does provide short-term liquidity support to member countries facing balance-of-payment difficulties. Although the exact establishment year might vary slightly, the core functionality described is accurate.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Launched by Germany, the ESSI is a unified air and missile defense system exclusively for NATO members.
2. The ESSI primarily focuses on long-range air and missile defense systems, complementing existing NATO capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ESSI, while launched with German leadership, is not *exclusively* for NATO members; it explicitly includes participation from both NATO and non-NATO countries. The statement incorrectly limits the ESSI's membership.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The ESSI’s focus is primarily on *short* range systems, not long-range, to fill gaps in existing European air defenses. The statement incorrectly describes the ESSI's primary focus.

Thus, both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the ESSI's scope and focus.


**8. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITU, founded in 1865, is the oldest intergovernmental organization globally, predating the League of Nations.
2.  The ITU's primary function is to allocate radio frequencies and satellite orbits, promoting global connectivity and the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ITU is indeed the oldest intergovernmental organization, founded in 1865 (and not 1945 as mentioned in the original text), predating the League of Nations.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Allocating radio frequencies and satellite orbits is a core function of the ITU, directly contributing to global communication and ICT development.

Therefore, both statements are factually accurate.  The question plays on the potentially less-known fact of the ITU's founding date.


**9. With reference to countries that have signed Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) in Criminal Matters with India, consider the following statements:**

1. Brazil and Germany are among the countries that have signed MLATs with India.
2. South Africa and Saudi Arabia are among the countries that have not signed MLATs with India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While not explicitly stated in the original text, it is a widely known fact that India has MLATs with both Brazil and Germany.  The statement is factually accurate, although this information is not directly found in the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text only mentions some countries that *have* signed MLATs, not those that haven't.  It is not possible to definitively ascertain which countries have *not* signed MLATs with India based on the text.  The statement attempts to create a misleading distractor by assuming negative information.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**10. With reference to BIMSTEC, consider the following statements:**

1. BIMSTEC, formed in 1997, comprises seven member states from South Asia and Southeast Asia, including India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, and Nepal.
2. The BIMSTEC Charter, adopted in 2004, outlines the organization's principles, objectives, and institutional framework, including a permanent secretariat in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. BIMSTEC was indeed formed in 1997 through the Bangkok Declaration, and it includes the seven member states listed.  However, the exact founding date might be debated slightly.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While a BIMSTEC Charter exists, it was adopted later than 2004, and the permanent secretariat is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The statement contains incorrect information about the adoption date and secretariat location.

Therefore, only statement 1 is largely correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Silk Road, a crucial trade route in ancient times, primarily facilitated the exchange of silk from China to the West, with India acting as a significant intermediary.  
2.  The introduction of Buddhism to China, significantly impacting its culture and philosophy,  occurred primarily through the Silk Road, with Indian Buddhist monks playing a key role in its dissemination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are largely accurate reflections of historical events.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Silk Road's pivotal role in the global silk trade, originating in China and reaching the West. India's geographical position facilitated its involvement as a major trading hub along this route, though the statement simplifies the complex web of trade relationships that existed. While other goods were traded, silk was undoubtedly a significant commodity.


Statement 2 accurately describes the spread of Buddhism to China.  The Silk Road served as a major conduit for the transmission of Buddhist ideas and practices from India to China.  Indian Buddhist monks actively travelled along the Silk Road, establishing monasteries and spreading Buddhist teachings, profoundly impacting Chinese culture and thought. While other routes and methods of transmission existed, the Silk Road played a dominant role in this cultural exchange.  The statements, while slightly simplified, capture the essence of these significant historical processes.


**2. With reference to the economic reforms initiated in China, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chinese economic reforms, starting in 1978 under Deng Xiaoping, primarily focused on the industrial sector, leading to rapid industrialization and a manufacturing boom.
2.  The dismantling of the commune system and the subsequent implementation of the household responsibility system in China's agricultural sector significantly boosted agricultural productivity and contributed to rapid poverty reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While China experienced rapid industrialization and a manufacturing boom post-1978,  the reforms were not *primarily* focused on the industrial sector from the outset.  The initial reforms, under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, strategically targeted the agricultural sector to address food security and release surplus labor for industrial development.  The industrial sector's growth was a subsequent outcome of these initial agricultural reforms and the overall economic liberalization.


Statement 2 is largely correct. The dismantling of the commune system and the subsequent introduction of the household responsibility system were pivotal in transforming China's agricultural sector.  This reform significantly increased agricultural output and efficiency, leading to improved food security and contributing substantially to poverty reduction.  The statement accurately reflects the sequence and impact of these key policy changes. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus River, a transboundary river flowing through both India and China, lacks a formal water-sharing agreement between the two nations, leading to occasional disputes.
2.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border between India and China, is a subject of ongoing territorial disputes, with both countries claiming areas under the other's control, exemplified by Aksai Chin and the Changmo Valley.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of India-China relations. Statement 1 correctly points out the absence of a formal water-sharing agreement on the Indus River, a crucial transboundary water resource. This lack of agreement has led to periods of tension and concern, particularly regarding dam construction and water allocation. While there might be some level of informal cooperation, the absence of a legally binding agreement remains a significant point of contention.


Statement 2 accurately highlights the ongoing territorial disputes along the LAC.  Aksai Chin, a region administered by China, and the Changmo Valley are specific examples of areas claimed by both India and China, leading to frequent border standoffs and military deployments.  The statement correctly identifies the LAC as a source of significant tension and a defining aspect of the complex relationship between the two nations.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**4. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO, founded in 2001, initially comprised six member states: Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, with India and Pakistan joining later in 2017.  Iran joined in 2023.
2. The Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), a permanent body of the SCO based in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, focuses on counterterrorism efforts, including the prevention of extremism and separatism, and India is a member of RATS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements provide accurate information regarding the SCO. Statement 1 correctly outlines the initial six founding members of the SCO in 2001, subsequently expanded with the inclusion of India and Pakistan in 2017 and Iran in 2023.  The statement accurately captures the evolution of the SCO's membership.


Statement 2 correctly describes the RATS and its mandate.  RATS, headquartered in Tashkent, is indeed a crucial component of the SCO's security architecture, focused on counterterrorism, extremism, and separatism.  India's membership in RATS reflects its commitment to regional security cooperation within the SCO framework. The statement accurately describes the role and location of RATS and India's involvement.  Therefore, both statements are correct.



**5. With reference to the ASEAN, consider the following statements:**

1. The ASEAN Community, launched in 2015, comprises three pillars: the ASEAN Political-Security Community, the ASEAN Economic Community, and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community, with the ASEAN Economic Community focusing on trade agreements like ATIGA.
2.  The ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation, comprising ASEAN member states, China, Japan, and South Korea, aims to enhance regional economic integration and addresses issues related to digital transformation.  India is an active dialogue partner in ASEAN.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the three pillars of the ASEAN Community launched in 2015.  These pillars represent the organization's multifaceted approach to regional cooperation, encompassing political, economic, and social aspects.  The statement also accurately links the ASEAN Economic Community with the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), a key initiative aimed at boosting trade and investment within the region.


Statement 2 accurately describes the ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation and India's role.  The ASEAN Plus Three mechanism does bring together ASEAN members, China, Japan, and South Korea to address issues of regional economic cooperation, including the challenges and opportunities presented by digital transformation.  Importantly, the statement correctly notes that India is an active dialogue partner in ASEAN, participating in various regional forums.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**6. With reference to the New Development Bank (NDB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDB, established in 2015, is primarily focused on mobilizing resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS nations and other developing countries, with its headquarters in Shanghai, China.  India is a major recipient of NDB loans.
2.  The NDB’s membership includes all BRICS nations, but excludes Bangladesh, the UAE, Egypt, and Uruguay, with the latter being a prospective member. The NDB has a regional office in GIFT City, Gujarat, India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the NDB's mandate, headquarters, and India's role. The NDB, established in 2015, is indeed focused on infrastructure and sustainable development projects, primarily in BRICS and other developing countries. Its headquarters are located in Shanghai, China, and India is a significant beneficiary of its funding, second only to China.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement incorrectly excludes several countries that are members of the NDB.  Bangladesh, the UAE, and Egypt are, in fact, members.  Uruguay is a prospective member, as stated, but this does not change the current reality of its non-membership.  The statement correctly identifies the location of a regional office in GIFT City, Gujarat.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**7. With reference to India's foreign policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's "Neighbourhood First Policy" emphasizes a consultative, non-reciprocal approach to foreign relations with its South Asian neighbours, prioritizing respect, dialogue, peace, prosperity, and cultural exchange.  This policy has been highly successful in enhancing trade with neighbouring countries.
2. The "Act East Policy," a key component of India's foreign policy, aims to strengthen economic and strategic ties with Southeast Asian nations. This policy includes infrastructure projects such as the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and the Kaladan Multimodal Project.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in its description of India's Neighbourhood First Policy but is incorrect in its conclusion about its success. The policy does indeed emphasize a non-reciprocal approach, prioritizing good relations with neighbors. The principles of Samman, Samvad, Shanti, Samriddhi, and Sanskriti are central to its framework. However, the statement's assertion that the policy has been "highly successful" in enhancing trade is not entirely accurate.  Recent data suggests that India's trade with its South Asian neighbors has been less than optimal, indicating challenges in fully realizing the policy's economic objectives.


Statement 2 correctly describes the Act East Policy and its goals.  The Act East Policy is a crucial component of India's foreign policy aimed at strengthening relations with East and Southeast Asian countries.  The mention of the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and the Kaladan Multimodal Project accurately exemplifies the policy's focus on infrastructure development and connectivity.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8. With reference to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The BRI, a major Chinese infrastructure initiative, aims to connect Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime networks, enhancing regional integration and economic growth; however, it excludes the South China Sea region.
2. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key component of the BRI, is a 3,000-km-long network of infrastructure projects connecting China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Gwadar Port in Pakistan's Balochistan province, passing through disputed Indian territory.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but ultimately inaccurate. While the BRI's overall aim is to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe, and it does aim to enhance regional integration and economic growth, the statement is incorrect to say it excludes the South China Sea.  The BRI includes significant maritime components that traverse the South China Sea, a region with substantial geopolitical implications and overlapping territorial claims.


Statement 2 is accurate. The CPEC, a crucial part of the BRI, is a major infrastructure project connecting China and Pakistan. Its route, approximately 3,000 km long, indeed passes through the disputed Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This passage through territory claimed by India is a major source of contention between India and China. Thus, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. Consider the following statements:**

1. The European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), launched by Germany, involves both NATO and non-NATO countries such as Switzerland and Austria, focusing on multi-layered air and missile defense systems, including the Iron Dome and Aegis systems.
2.  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the United Nations, is responsible for allocating global radio spectrum and satellite orbits, developing technical standards for seamless network interconnectivity, and improving ICT access worldwide; India has been a member since 1869.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect in its description of ESSI's components. While ESSI is indeed a German-led initiative involving both NATO and non-NATO members, its focus is on multi-layered air and missile defense systems.  However, the statement incorrectly includes the Iron Dome and Aegis systems as specific components of ESSI.  These are distinct systems developed by different countries.  The ESSI aims for broader interoperability among various existing systems rather than focusing on specific named systems.


Statement 2 accurately describes the ITU and India's membership. The ITU, a UN specialized agency, is responsible for managing global radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbits, as well as developing technical standards for ICTs.  India's long-standing membership since 1869 is also correctly stated.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the  International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL), consider the following statements:**

1. INTERPOL, established in 1923, facilitates information exchange between national police forces globally, operating from its headquarters in Lyon, France, and currently has 196 member countries, including India, but is not a policing force itself.
2.  The CBI Academy of India's recent affiliation with the INTERPOL Global Academy Network signifies India's commitment to international police cooperation, enhancing training and capacity building in areas such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing, as emphasized by the Macolin Convention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately portrays INTERPOL's role, headquarters, membership, and limitations. INTERPOL, founded in 1923, serves as a crucial platform for international police cooperation, facilitating information sharing between national police forces. Its headquarters are in Lyon, France, and it has a vast membership, including India.  Crucially, the statement correctly notes that INTERPOL itself is not a police force; it does not have the authority to arrest individuals or directly investigate and prosecute crimes.


Statement 2 correctly highlights the significance of the CBI Academy's affiliation with the INTERPOL Global Academy Network.  This affiliation strengthens India's commitment to international police cooperation, particularly in enhancing training and capacity building, which includes, but is not limited to, areas such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  The Macolin Convention, while focused on combating match-fixing in sports, is an example of international efforts to tackle criminal activities that INTERPOL supports.  Therefore, both statements are correct.



**11.  With reference to India's relations with its neighbours, consider the following statements:**

1. India's trade with its South Asian neighbours, while having Bangladesh as its largest export market, has experienced a significant decline in recent years due to factors such as para-tariffs, regulatory hurdles, and infrastructure deficiencies in the region.
2.  China's trade with India's South Asian neighbours significantly surpasses India's despite India having lower tariffs, highlighting the need for India to improve its infrastructure, streamline regulations, and address non-tariff barriers to enhance its regional economic engagement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct and highlight important aspects of India's regional economic engagement. Statement 1 accurately notes the decline in India's post-pandemic trade with its South Asian neighbours. While Bangladesh remains the largest export market for India in the region, the overall trade volume has fallen significantly. This decline is attributed to various factors, including para-tariffs, complex regulations, inadequate infrastructure, high logistics costs, and the prevalence of informal trade, all of which act as non-tariff barriers.


Statement 2 correctly compares India's and China's trade with South Asian neighbours.  China's trade with these countries significantly exceeds India's, even though India has lower tariffs, indicating that factors beyond tariffs such as infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and non-tariff barriers play a more significant role in determining trade volumes.  This underscores the need for India to address these challenges to enhance its competitiveness and economic influence in the region.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**12. With reference to the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), consider the following statements:**

1. IORA, established in 1997, aims to strengthen regional cooperation and sustainable development in the Indian Ocean region, comprising 23 member countries, including India, with the Council of Ministers (CoM) as its apex decision-making body.  India currently holds the IORA chairship.
2.  IORA's significance lies in representing a substantial share of the world's population, a significant portion of global oil trade, and a large share of global goods and services production; intra-IORA trade is approximately $800 billion, with India set to assume the chairship in 2027-2029.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes IORA's mandate, membership, and structure. IORA, established in 1997, indeed aims to foster cooperation and sustainable development in the Indian Ocean region.  It includes 23 member countries, with India among them. The CoM serves as its highest decision-making body.  However, the statement is incorrect in asserting that India currently holds the IORA chairship. The chairship rotates among member states and is currently held by Sri Lanka (2023-2025), with India scheduled to assume it in 2025-2027.


Statement 2 correctly highlights IORA's economic significance but is incorrect about the chairship timeline. IORA does encompass a large portion of the world's population, a significant share of global oil trade, and a substantial volume of global goods and services production.  Intra-IORA trade is also substantial, but the statement is inaccurate regarding India's chairship timeline.  Therefore, only statement 1 is largely correct.


**13. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), launched in 2022, aims to deepen economic cooperation among participating countries in the Indo-Pacific region, focusing on areas such as trade, supply chains, and clean energy; India is a key participant.
2. The third IPEF Ministerial Meeting, held in San Francisco, USA, in October 2023, focused on initiatives for diversifying supply chains for clean energy products, emphasizing the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) as a core objective.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified instructions.  The difficulty level is assessed as "difficult" for each question due to the subtle nuances in the factual data and the incorporation of plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, mandates electronic registration for the possession of all scheduled animal species within three months of the Act's amendment in 2022.
2.  The Living Animal Species (Reporting and Registration) Rules, 2024, require reporting the birth of scheduled animal species within seven days and registration within fifteen days.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act of 2022 added Section 49M, which deals with the registration of scheduled animal species. However, the statement incorrectly states that the registration must be completed within three months of the *amendment*, not the *possession*.  The timeframe for registration is actually six months from the date of possession, as per the Living Animal Species (Reporting and Registration) Rules, 2024. The statement also incorrectly implies that *all* scheduled species are subject to this immediate electronic registration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Living Animal Species (Reporting and Registration) Rules, 2024, correctly stipulate a seven-day reporting period for the birth of scheduled species. However, it incorrectly states that registration must be done within *fifteen* days.  The actual timeframe for registration is also six months from the date of possession, not seven days. The rules are intended to streamline the reporting and registration process, but the statement misrepresents the specific timelines.  The confusion is created by mixing the timeframe for reporting and registration.


**2. With reference to Project Tiger, consider the following statements:**

2.  The MoSPI's release of the SDGs – National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report provides a comprehensive overview of India's progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including detailed data on social, economic, and environmental indicators.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) is primarily focused on the manufacturing sector, not the agricultural sector.  It provides crucial data on the growth, structure, and composition of various manufacturing industries in India. This data includes information on output, value added, employment, and capital formation.  The agricultural sector is covered by different surveys and censuses conducted by other ministries.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) indeed releases the SDGs – National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report.  This report offers a comprehensive assessment of India's progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  It includes detailed data and analysis across various sectors, including social, economic, and environmental indicators, providing a valuable tool for monitoring and evaluating progress.


**3. With reference to the State of Maharashtra, consider the following statements:**

1. Maharashtra's tree cover, as per recent assessments, exceeds its total forest cover, indicating a significant presence of trees outside formally designated forest areas.

2. The  Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), a regional political party, primarily focuses its political activities on issues related to the protection of tribal communities and their rights.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Maharashtra has significant tree cover outside formally designated forest areas, it is inaccurate to state that it *exceeds* its total forest cover.  Total forest cover includes all areas officially designated as forests, while tree cover encompasses all areas with tree density.  While there's often overlap, total forest cover is a smaller, more precisely defined area.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) is a regional political party that does not primarily focus on tribal rights.  While it may address some issues related to various communities, its core political agenda is generally centered around other issues such as Marathi language and regional identity,  economic development, and infrastructure.  Its focus is broader than solely tribal rights.


**4. With reference to the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The prize was awarded for the discovery of microRNAs, which are small, single-stranded RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA).

2. The laureates, Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun,  conducted their pioneering research primarily using the model organism *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit fly).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was indeed awarded to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNAs. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences on messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. This discovery significantly advanced our understanding of gene regulation and its implications in development and disease.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While *Drosophila melanogaster* is a widely used model organism in genetic research, Ambros and Ruvkun's groundbreaking work on microRNAs was primarily conducted using the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, not the fruit fly.  *C. elegans* proved to be a particularly valuable model due to its relatively simple genome and ease of genetic manipulation.  The choice of model organism was crucial to their success in unraveling the function of microRNAs.


**5. With reference to  gene therapy, consider the following statements:**

1. Germline gene therapy, which involves modifying germline cells (sperm or egg cells), is currently legal and widely practiced in India due to its potential to cure inherited genetic diseases in future generations.

2. Somatic cell gene therapy, where therapeutic genes are transferred to somatic cells (non-germline cells), is a safer approach as any genetic modifications are restricted to the individual patient and are not heritable.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Germline gene therapy, while offering the potential to prevent inherited diseases from being passed down through generations, raises significant ethical concerns.  It involves permanent changes to the human germline, potentially impacting future generations, and is therefore highly regulated and, in many countries including India, currently prohibited.


Statement 2 is correct. Somatic cell gene therapy targets non-germline cells, meaning any genetic modifications are confined to the individual patient and are not passed on to offspring.  This limits the potential risks associated with unintended consequences for future generations, making it a relatively safer approach compared to germline gene therapy.  However, even somatic cell gene therapy carries risks and requires rigorous safety protocols.

**1. With reference to the Chishti Sufi order, consider the following statements:**

1.  Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the founder of the Chishti order, primarily propagated the concept of "Piran-e-Pir" emphasizing a hierarchical chain of spiritual guidance.
2.  The Chishti order's philosophical foundation was deeply rooted in pantheistic monism, advocating for the unity of existence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti was a significant figure in the Chishti order and the concept of "Piran-e-Pir" (spiritual guide of spiritual guides) was prevalent within the order,  it wasn't his *primary* propagation. The emphasis on spiritual lineage and guidance was a characteristic of the Chishti order as a whole, developed and refined over time by various Sufi masters.  The concept's popularization was a collective effort.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chishti order's core tenets strongly align with pantheistic monism, a belief in the oneness of God and the interconnectedness of all things. This concept emphasizes the immanence of God within creation and the potential for spiritual union with the divine.  This is a central theme in Chishti teachings and practices.


**2. With reference to the Sanchi Stupa, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sanchi Stupa's extensive mural paintings, depicting scenes from the life of Buddha, are a testament to the artistic skills of the Kushana dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sanchi Stupa is indeed renowned for its artistic merit, the extensive mural paintings are not a feature of the Stupa itself.  The primary artistic expressions of the Sanchi Stupa are its sculptural decorations, notably the gateways (toranas) and railings.  The Kushana dynasty did contribute to the development of Buddhist art, but their artistic contributions are not specifically linked to the mural paintings at Sanchi, which are largely from earlier periods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Amaravati Stupa and the Sanchi Stupa are both significant Buddhist monuments showcasing exceptional artistry and architectural skill, they are not primarily examples of *Maurya period* Buddhist art.  Although the Sanchi Stupa's origins are linked to the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, its development and expansion continued under subsequent dynasties (Shungas and Satavahanas). The Amaravati Stupa's major construction phase belongs to a later period.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dr. Rajendra Prasad is widely known for his political and social contributions, serving as the first President of India and holding prominent positions within the Indian National Congress. He is not associated with any significant contributions to 20th-century mathematics.  His expertise lay in the fields of law, politics, and social reform.

Statement 2 is correct. "Atmakatha" (1946) is indeed Dr. Rajendra Prasad's autobiography, providing a first-hand account of his experiences during the Indian freedom struggle and his involvement in the nation's formative years. This work offers invaluable historical context and insights into the period.


**4. With reference to the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, consider the following statements:**

1. The current structure of the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, including its white marble dome, was primarily constructed during the reign of Emperor Akbar, reflecting his policy of religious tolerance.
2.  The Ajmer Sharif Dargah's history is intrinsically linked to the Chishti Sufi order, founded by Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, whose tomb is located at the heart of the complex.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar was a contemporary of the Chishti order and known for his religious tolerance, the current white marble dome of the Ajmer Sharif Dargah was not built during his reign. The major construction and expansion of the dargah complex occurred over centuries under various rulers, including the Khalji rulers,  with significant additions and renovations made after Akbar's time. The present dome's construction is attributed to a later period.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ajmer Sharif Dargah is deeply connected to the Chishti Sufi order.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Angami Naga tribe is a significant participant in the Hornbill Festival, it is not *primarily* celebrated by them alone. The Hornbill Festival is a state-level festival in Nagaland, bringing together various Naga tribes to showcase their diverse cultural expressions.  It's a collaborative celebration of Naga heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Hornbill Festival's main venue is the Kisama Heritage Village in Nagaland, the celebrations are not exclusively confined to that location.  Several other locations across Nagaland participate and host related events, making the festival a broader, state-wide event, not solely limited to Kisama.


**6. With reference to the Eklingji Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Eklingji Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is historically significant for its association with the Nath sect of Hinduism, representing a blend of Shaivism and Nath traditions.
2.  The temple served as both a strategic fort and a prominent religious site during the 6th century CE, showcasing a unique confluence of military and spiritual architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Eklingji Temple is indeed dedicated to Lord Shiva, its primary cultural significance lies in its association with the Mewar kingdom, not the Nath sect. The temple is considered the spiritual and administrative seat of the Mewar kingdom, with the deity Eklingji considered the supreme ruler.  The temple's prominence is within the context of Mewari history and tradition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Eklingji Temple undoubtedly holds religious importance,  its architectural style and historical context don't suggest it served as a major strategic fort during the 6th century. The major construction and expansion of the temple complex occurred much later, in subsequent centuries. The temple's primary function has always been religious, not military.


**7. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vaikom Satyagraha was primarily a movement against the practice of untouchability, aiming to secure the entry of Dalits into public spaces, including temples.
2. E.V. Ramasamy Periyar, a prominent Dravidian movement leader, played a pivotal role in initiating and leading the Vaikom Satyagraha alongside T.K. Madhavan and K. Kelappan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha (1924-25) was a significant movement against untouchability in Travancore. Its main objective was to secure the right of entry for Dalits into public roads and temples near Vaikom. The movement successfully challenged the discriminatory practices that barred Dalits from accessing these public spaces.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While T.K. Madhavan and K. Kelappan were key leaders of the Vaikom Satyagraha, E.V. Ramasamy Periyar's direct involvement in leading the movement itself was limited.  Periyar's support for Dalit rights was significant, and he likely supported the movement ideologically, but he wasn't a primary leader in the day-to-day organization and execution of the Vaikom Satyagraha.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sardar Udham Singh was indeed a member of the Ghadar Party and his assassination of General Michael O'Dwyer in 1940 was a direct act of revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.  O'Dwyer, as Lieutenant Governor of Punjab at the time, was held directly responsible for the massacre.  Singh's act was widely seen as a symbolic act of retribution within the Indian independence movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Udham Singh's act was undoubtedly fueled by personal grief and a desire for revenge, it also held significant political ramifications.  It served as a powerful symbol of resistance against British oppression and resonated with many Indians who had suffered under colonial rule.  The assassination was not merely a personal act but also a politically charged event within the broader struggle for independence.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  "India Divided" (1947) was not authored by Jawaharlal Nehru.  The book was written by another significant figure.  The question uses a prominent figure associated with the period to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Dr. Rajendra Prasad was not a co-author of "India Divided."   The statement wrongly links two important figures from the time to create confusion.  The correct author is a different personality altogether.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided information about Humayun and Akbar, adhering to the specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level by incorporating misleading information and plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Humayun's initial conquest of Gujarat was swiftly followed by his consolidation of power in the Deccan, leading to the annexation of several key Deccan sultanates.
2. Akbar's reign witnessed significant expansion of the Mughal Empire into the Deccan, but his attempts to fully subjugate the region were met with consistent resistance from local powers, leading to prolonged conflicts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Humayun did conquer Gujarat, his hold on the region was tenuous and short-lived. His focus after regaining the Delhi Sultanate was primarily on consolidating his power in the north, not on immediate Deccan expansion.  The Deccan remained a focus for later Mughal emperors.  The statement wrongly links Humayun's Gujarat conquest with immediate success in the Deccan.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's Deccan campaigns constitute a significant portion of his reign. He did expand Mughal influence considerably into the Deccan but faced strong resistance from established Deccan sultanates like Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda. These conflicts spanned years and ultimately resulted in only partial Mughal control.  The statement accurately reflects the challenges Akbar encountered in the Deccan.  The continuous resistance and prolonged nature of the conflicts are key historical facts that differentiate this statement from the incorrect option.


**2. With reference to the Mughal Empire's administrative systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's Mansabdari system, while initially effective in organizing the Mughal military and administration, eventually led to the fragmentation of power and weakened the central authority in later Mughal reigns.
2.  Humayun's administrative reforms, though less extensive than Akbar's, focused primarily on strengthening the Mughal presence in the newly conquered territories of Gujarat and Malwa, thereby ensuring immediate stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Akbar's Mansabdari system, a crucial component of his administrative reforms, aimed to create a hierarchical structure within the military and bureaucracy. However, the system's inherent complexities and the growing power of individual Mansabdars did contribute to the decline of central control in later Mughal periods. This long-term consequence is a key aspect of the system's evaluation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Humayun's reign was characterized by instability and constant struggle for power. His administrative reforms were largely reactive, aimed at recapturing lost territories and dealing with immediate threats rather than systematically consolidating power in newly acquired areas like Gujarat and Malwa.  These regions, particularly Gujarat, slipped from Mughal control after Humayun's death. The statement misrepresents the unstable nature of Humayun's reign and overstates the success of his administrative reforms.


**3. With reference to the religious policies of Mughal emperors, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* (universal peace), while promoting religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue, ultimately failed to prevent religious tensions and conflicts within the Mughal Empire.
2. Humayun's religious policies, being largely shaped by the prevailing religious environment of his time, were far less interventionist than Akbar’s, primarily focusing on consolidating his own power base rather than promoting widespread religious harmony.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Akbar's *sulh-i-kul* policy was indeed progressive for its time, fostering religious tolerance and dialogue through initiatives like the *Ibadat Khana*. However, the policy didn't fully eradicate religious tensions; conflicts and disagreements persisted within the empire, particularly among different religious groups and factions. The statement accurately reflects both the positive aspects and the limitations of Akbar's religious policy.

Statement 2 is also correct. Humayun's reign was too short and turbulent to establish a clear and consistent religious policy. Compared to Akbar's more proactive and deliberate religious policies, Humayun's approach was more focused on consolidating his political authority after regaining his throne. The statement highlights the contrast in the scale and nature of the religious policies of Humayun and Akbar. The contextual understanding of the historical period is crucial in evaluating these statements.


**4. With reference to the Mughal architectural legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Humayun's Tomb, though built during Humayun's lifetime, was completed and significantly altered by Akbar, showcasing a blend of Timurid and early Mughal architectural styles.
2. Akbar's architectural patronage extended beyond his own mausoleum; he commissioned numerous grand structures, including mosques, forts, and palaces, across various regions of his empire, reflecting a unique synthesis of Persian, Central Asian, and Indian architectural styles.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Humayun's Tomb, a significant architectural landmark, was indeed commissioned during Humayun's reign but its construction was completed after his death, primarily under Akbar's supervision. The final structure exhibits a blend of architectural styles reflecting both Timurid influences (from Humayun's era) and the emerging Mughal style under Akbar.  This complex history of construction and style is a key element for accurate recall.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's vast architectural legacy is well-documented. Beyond his own tomb, he commissioned numerous significant buildings like Fatehpur Sikri, Humayun's Tomb (completion and alterations),  and various mosques and forts across his empire. These structures reveal a distinct synthesis of various architectural styles, showcasing Akbar's patronage of diverse artistic influences. The statement accurately captures the breadth and stylistic features of Akbar’s building projects.


**5. With reference to the Mughal expansion in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's conquest of Gujarat secured a vital trade route for the Mughal Empire, leading to increased economic prosperity and further expansion of Mughal influence.
2. Humayun’s conquest of Gujarat was characterized by swift military victories, followed by a period of stable rule that integrated Gujarat seamlessly into the Mughal empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's successful campaign in Gujarat, which solidified Mughal control of the region, had a significant impact on the empire's economy. Gujarat's flourishing ports and its strategic location provided the Mughal Empire access to valuable trade routes, boosting its economic wealth and enabling subsequent expansion. The statement accurately highlights the economic and political importance of Akbar's conquest of Gujarat.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Humayun's conquest of Gujarat was far from a stable affair. While he achieved military victories, his hold on the region was tenuous and short-lived. His rule was marked by instability, and Gujarat was not seamlessly integrated into the Mughal Empire. The statement misrepresents the volatile situation and the temporary nature of Humayun’s control over Gujarat.  The contrasting fates of Gujarat under Humayun and Akbar are key historical facts.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to land reforms in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Swatantra Party actively championed land reforms as a means to improve socio-economic conditions for all farmers.
2. The Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution initially excluded laws related to land reforms from judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swatantra Party, a right-wing political party, actively *opposed* land reforms, viewing them as detrimental to the interests of larger landowners.  Their ideology favored a more laissez-faire approach to the economy.  Conversely, the Congress ministries, particularly during Chaudhary Charan Singh's tenure as Prime Minister, strongly advocated and implemented land reforms to benefit marginal and small farmers, improving socio-economic conditions for a significant section of the agricultural population.  The Sarvodaya Plan, for example, highlighted the importance of land reforms as a crucial political and economic reform.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ninth Schedule of the Indian Constitution was initially used to shield laws related to land reforms (and other matters) from judicial review. This was done to ensure the swift and efficient implementation of these policies, even if they potentially violated fundamental rights.  However, the Supreme Court later imposed limitations on the extent of this protection. The inclusion of land reform legislation under the Ninth Schedule, therefore, aimed at protecting these laws from legal challenges that could hinder their implementation.  The zamindari abolition, a key component of land reforms, was also protected under this provision.  This demonstrates a complex interplay between constitutional provisions, judicial review, and the implementation of socio-economic policies.


**2. Consider the following statements about Chaudhary Charan Singh's contributions:**

1.  He received the Bharat Ratna posthumously for his significant contributions to agricultural development and farmers' welfare.
2. The Debt Redemption Bill of 1939, a landmark legislation aimed at alleviating farmer indebtedness, was introduced during his tenure as Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chaudhary Charan Singh is indeed a recipient of the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.  However, it's important to note that it was conferred *posthumously*, recognizing his lifelong advocacy for farmers' rights and his significant contributions to land reforms and agricultural productivity improvements. His work on land reforms significantly benefitted marginal and small farmers, improving their socio-economic conditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chaudhary Charan Singh was a strong advocate for farmer welfare and introduced several crucial bills related to agricultural credit and debt relief during his time as Prime Minister (1979-1980), the Debt Redemption Bill of 1939 predates his premiership significantly.  This bill, aimed at easing the burden of debt on farmers, was introduced much earlier in his political career, highlighting his consistent focus on agrarian issues throughout his life.  The mismatched chronology in the statement makes it incorrect.


**3. With reference to the impact of climate change on India, consider the following statements:**

1. Climate change has consistently enhanced India's agricultural productivity, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, due to increased monsoon rainfall.
2.  The National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is a government program designed to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indo-Gangetic Plain is known for its high agricultural productivity, attributing this solely to increased monsoon rainfall and claiming a consistent enhancement due to climate change is inaccurate. Climate change presents a complex and multifaceted challenge to agricultural productivity in India. While some regions might experience short-term benefits from altered rainfall patterns,  the overall impact of climate change, including erratic rainfall, increased frequency of extreme weather events (droughts, floods), and shifting temperature patterns, poses a significant threat to long-term agricultural sustainability. Increased frequency of droughts and floods, for instance, can severely destabilize agricultural productivity.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is a flagship program of the Government of India aimed at improving the resilience of Indian agriculture to climate change.  The program focuses on various strategies to enhance agricultural productivity despite the challenges posed by climate change. This includes promoting climate-resilient crops, improving water management, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices.  Other initiatives like the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) scheme and the PM Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana also aim to improve agricultural productivity by addressing challenges related to fertilizer use and crop diversification.  Therefore, statement 2 accurately reflects the government's efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture.


**4. With reference to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hunter Committee, established to investigate the massacre, exonerated General Dyer of any wrongdoing.
2. Udham Singh, a Ghadar Party member, assassinated General O'Dwyer in retaliation for the massacre.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Hunter Committee, while acknowledging the severity of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, did not fully exonerate General Dyer. The committee's report criticized Dyer's actions, though it stopped short of recommending severe punishment. This led to widespread outrage and further fueled the Indian independence movement. The massacre, occurring on Baisakhi day, remains a potent symbol of British brutality and colonial oppression.

Statement 2 is correct. Udham Singh, a fervent Indian revolutionary associated with the Ghadar Party and the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), is indeed renowned for assassinating Michael O'Dwyer, the then Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, who was directly responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.  Singh, himself a survivor of the massacre, carried out the assassination in 1940 as an act of revenge, demonstrating the profound and lasting impact of the event on the Indian freedom struggle.  This act highlights the intensity of feeling among Indian nationalists in response to the violence.


**5. With reference to the  activities of Mahatma Gandhi, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Salt March, a pivotal moment in the Indian independence movement, was directly inspired by the teachings of Sri Ramanujacharya.
2. Mahatma Gandhi's advocacy for non-cooperation and civil disobedience significantly influenced the subsequent Quit India Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy was influenced by various religious and philosophical traditions, including aspects of Hinduism, the Salt March was primarily a response to the British salt tax, a direct form of economic oppression.  The strategy of the Salt March, utilizing non-violent civil disobedience, was a core element of Gandhi's philosophy but not directly linked to the specific teachings of Sri Ramanujacharya.  The Salt March, culminating at Dandi, exemplified Gandhi's approach to non-violent resistance.

Statement 2 is correct. Mahatma Gandhi's advocacy for non-cooperation and civil disobedience served as a crucial foundation for many subsequent movements in the Indian independence struggle, most notably the Quit India Movement.  The Quit India Movement, launched on August 9th, 1942, demonstrated the widespread support for the call for immediate independence from British rule, directly echoing Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.  The movement's widespread participation, despite the severe repression by the British, underscores the effectiveness of Gandhi's strategies in mobilizing the Indian populace.  Key figures like Lal Bahadur Shastri and Aruna Asaf Ali actively participated in the Quit India Movement.  The movement also saw the emergence of parallel governments in some regions, highlighting the depth of popular participation. The involvement of various groups like socialists and revolutionary nationalists further illustrates the breadth of the movement's appeal.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI data is compiled and published by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry every month.
2.  The base year for the ICI was changed to 2011-12 from 2004-05 in 2017.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ICI *is* released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry,  the compilation and publication of the data is actually done by the Office of the Economic Adviser under that ministry, not the ministry itself.  Further, the IIP data, of which the ICI is a component, is compiled and published monthly by the CSO (Central Statistical Organisation), operating under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).  The ICI itself is published monthly.  This difference in responsible agencies creates a potential for confusion.

Statement 2 is correct. The base year for the Index of Eight Core Industries (and the broader Index of Industrial Production) was indeed revised from 2004-05 to 2011-12 in 2017. This revision is a standard practice to reflect structural changes in the economy and provide a more accurate representation of economic growth.  The change reflects a shift in the methodologies used to account for economic activity and the impact of technological advancements.


**2. With reference to the Vadhavan greenfield port, consider the following statements:**

1. It is being developed solely by the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA).
2. Upon completion, it is projected to be among the top 10 ports globally in terms of container handling capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vadhavan greenfield port is a joint venture between the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA) and the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB).  Attributing the development solely to the JNPA overlooks the significant role of the MMB in the project's planning and execution. Joint ventures are common in large infrastructure projects to leverage the expertise and resources of different organizations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Vadhavan port project aims for a significant increase in India's container trade, aiming to double existing levels. This ambitious goal is consistent with the projection of its ranking among the world's top 10 ports upon completion.  Such large-scale infrastructure projects are designed to enhance a nation's trade competitiveness and global standing in the maritime sector.


**3. With reference to Zaid crops, consider the following statements:**

1. Zaid crops are grown during the monsoon season, alongside Kharif crops.
2. Zaid crops generally have a shorter growing season compared to Rabi and Kharif crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Zaid crops are cultivated in the short period between the Rabi and Kharif seasons.  They are strategically planted to utilize the residual soil moisture after the Rabi harvest and before the onset of the monsoon rains for Kharif crops.  This timing allows farmers to make optimal use of available resources and potentially increase their overall agricultural output.

Statement 2 is correct. Zaid crops are characterized by their relatively short growing period, often maturing much faster than the major Rabi and Kharif crops. This shorter duration allows for multiple cropping cycles within a year, depending on the specific crop and climatic conditions. The shorter growing season is a key adaptation to the specific window of opportunity presented by the drier period between the main cropping seasons.


**4. With reference to windfall taxes, consider the following statements:**

1. Windfall taxes are levied only on domestically produced crude oil.
2.  Windfall taxes are designed to address excess profits earned by companies due to unforeseen external events.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While windfall taxes *can* be applied to domestically produced crude oil, their scope is not limited to this commodity alone.  They can be levied on various products and sectors where companies unexpectedly benefit from external factors beyond their direct control, such as price fluctuations in global markets.  The application of windfall taxes is flexible and depends on the specific economic context and policy objectives of the government.

Statement 2 is correct. Windfall taxes are specifically designed to capture excess profits generated by firms due to unexpected external events, such as sudden surges in commodity prices or changes in global market conditions.  These taxes aim to address situations where companies benefit disproportionately from circumstances beyond their control, often allowing the government to redistribute some of these gains for the public good or to mitigate the impact of price increases on consumers.



**5. With reference to the Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The bill aims to restrict the participation of Indian-flagged vessels in coastal trade.
2. The bill proposes the creation of a National Database for coastal shipping.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024, aims to *promote* coastal trade and *encourage* the participation of Indian-flagged vessels owned and operated by Indian citizens. This is primarily for national security and commercial reasons, aiming to boost domestic shipping and reduce reliance on foreign vessels. The bill seeks to enhance the competitiveness of Indian shipping in the coastal trade sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The bill indeed proposes the establishment of a National Database for coastal shipping to improve transparency and facilitate information sharing among stakeholders.  Such databases are crucial for efficient management of coastal shipping, tracking vessel movements, and ensuring regulatory compliance. The database will improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the coastal shipping sector.


**6. With reference to the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bill allows bank account holders to have only one nominee.
2. The Bill increases the tenure of directors (excluding chairman and whole-time director) in cooperative banks from eight years to ten years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, allows bank account holders to have up to *four* nominees, not just one. This amendment increases flexibility and provides greater options for account holders to designate beneficiaries for their accounts. The increased number of nominees provides more options for account holders to manage their funds and ensures a smoother succession process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bill does increase the tenure of directors (excluding the chairman and whole-time director) in cooperative banks from eight years to ten years.  This change aims to provide greater stability and continuity to the management of cooperative banks.  Longer tenures allow directors to implement long-term strategies and gain deeper institutional knowledge, potentially improving the overall governance and performance of these banks.


**7. With reference to Gharchola sarees, consider the following statements:**

1. Gharchola sarees have been awarded a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for a period of 15 years.
2. Gharchola sarees are traditionally worn during Hindu weddings only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gharchola sarees *have* received a GI tag, the validity period is 10 years, not 15, and is renewable.  The GI tag provides legal protection against unauthorized use of the name and protects the distinct characteristics of this traditional Gujarati saree.  The renewable nature of the GI tag ensures ongoing protection for the product and its associated craftsmanship.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gharchola sarees are traditionally worn during both Hindu *and* Jain weddings.  The statement's limited scope overlooks the significance of this saree in Jain wedding traditions.  The inclusion of both traditions in the saree’s usage highlights the broader cultural significance of the garment.


**8. With reference to the classification of packaged drinking/mineral water by FSSAI, consider the following statements:**

1. Packaged drinking/mineral water is categorized as a 'low-risk food' by FSSAI.
2. FSSAI is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Packaged drinking/mineral water is categorized as a 'high-risk food' by FSSAI, not low-risk.  This classification reflects the potential for contamination and the importance of stringent quality control measures throughout the production and distribution processes.  The high-risk categorization emphasizes the need for robust regulations to ensure the safety and purity of drinking water.

Statement 2 is correct. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is indeed an autonomous body established under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Its autonomy allows it to function independently in regulating food safety and standards, ensuring consistent enforcement of food safety regulations.  The placement under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare highlights the importance of food safety for public health.


**9. With reference to Bitcoin, consider the following statements:**

1. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008.
2. Bitcoin uses Blockchain technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009, not 2008. The year 2009 marks the launch of the Bitcoin network and the beginning of its use as a decentralized digital currency.  The precise date is important for understanding the timeline of cryptocurrency development.

Statement 2 is correct. Bitcoin fundamentally relies on Blockchain technology for its operation.  The Blockchain's decentralized and transparent nature is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of Bitcoin transactions. Blockchain technology underpins the core functionality of Bitcoin, enabling its use as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.



**10. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) prohibits FDI in the textile manufacturing sector.
2. The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CFI) regulates FDI in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The DPIIT formulates policies related to FDI, but it does not prohibit FDI in any specific sector.  The textile manufacturing sector in India actively attracts FDI.  Prohibitions on FDI would be counterproductive to economic growth and the government's policy aims for attracting foreign investment.  Policies related to FDI are dynamic and adjusted based on economic conditions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CFI) plays a crucial role in regulating FDI in India.  It reviews and approves proposals for foreign investment in sectors with strategic implications. The CFI ensures that foreign investment aligns with national interests and economic development goals. Its regulatory function is essential for managing foreign investment inflows.


**11. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India fixes MSP for all agricultural crops.
2. MSP is a form of market intervention to protect agricultural producers against sharp price drops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Government of India fixes MSP for a *specified number* of mandated agricultural crops, not *all* crops. The selection of crops for MSP is based on several factors, including their economic significance, market volatility, and the need for government intervention.  The list of crops covered under MSP is periodically reviewed and adjusted.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary purpose of MSP is to provide a safety net for farmers by ensuring a minimum price for their produce.  This market intervention aims to stabilize farm incomes and prevent sharp price declines, which can significantly impact the livelihoods of agricultural producers.  The MSP mechanism is a critical component of the government's agricultural policy.


**12. With reference to India’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) program, consider the following statements:**

1. The SPR program’s Phase II includes new facilities at Visakhapatnam and Mangalore.
2. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) manages the SPR program.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Phase II of the SPR program does involve new facilities, they are located at Chandikhol and Padur, not Visakhapatnam and Mangalore.  The locations chosen for SPR facilities are strategically determined based on factors such as geographical distribution, proximity to refineries, and overall logistical considerations.  The precise locations are crucial for efficient storage and distribution of petroleum reserves.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SPR program is *not* managed by ONGC.  Although ONGC plays a role in the program, the management is handled by a different agency.  The correct agency responsible for managing the SPR program is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. This omission creates a potential for incorrect assumptions.


**13. With reference to the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), consider the following statements:**

1. A lower REER improves export competitiveness.
2. REER is an indicator of a nation's international competitiveness relative to its trading partners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A lower REER makes a country's exports more competitive in the international market because its goods and services become relatively cheaper compared to those of its trading partners.  This can lead to increased export volumes and potentially improve the country's trade balance.  Understanding the relationship between REER and export competitiveness is crucial for designing effective trade policies.

Statement 2 is correct. The REER is a crucial indicator of a nation's international price competitiveness.  It considers the exchange rate and relative price levels of goods and services with its trading partners, providing a more comprehensive picture of a country's export competitiveness than simply looking at the nominal exchange rate. The REER is a key tool for analyzing a country's macroeconomic performance and its position in the global market.


**14. With reference to the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) 2023-24, consider the following statements:**

1. The survey covers unincorporated non-agricultural establishments in all sectors of the economy.
2.  The ASUSE 2023-24 reported an increase in the percentage of female-owned proprietary establishments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASUSE 2023-24 does *not* cover all sectors of the economy.  Its scope is limited to unincorporated non-agricultural establishments in specific sectors, which are not fully detailed in the provided text. The limited scope of the survey should be considered when interpreting its findings.

Statement 2 is correct.  The ASUSE 2023-24 did report an increase in the percentage of female-owned proprietary establishments.  The precise percentage is given as 26.2%. This finding is indicative of changes in the ownership structure of small businesses and the growing participation of women in the Indian economy.  Analyzing this trend requires an understanding of the survey's methodology and data limitations.


**15. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following statements:**

1. Higher Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) Ratio indicates a healthier loan portfolio.
2. NPAs are loans or advances where the borrower has ceased making interest or principal repayments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A higher GNPA ratio actually indicates a *less* healthy loan portfolio, as it signifies a greater proportion of loans at risk of default.  The GNPA ratio is a key indicator of a financial institution's asset quality and overall financial health. A lower GNPA ratio is desirable for financial stability.

Statement 2 is correct.  NPAs are indeed loans or advances where the borrower has stopped making timely payments of either interest or principal, or both.  This definition is crucial for understanding the nature of NPAs and their impact on financial institutions.  The timely repayment of loans is essential for the smooth functioning of the financial system.


**16. With reference to the Current Account Deficit (CAD), consider the following statements:**

1. A CAD indicates that a country's exports exceed its imports.
2.  A CAD reflects a country's imbalance in international trade of goods and services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A CAD indicates that a country's *imports* exceed its *exports*, resulting in a net outflow of funds in the current account of its balance of payments.  This imbalance reflects the difference between a nation's earnings from exports and its spending on imports.  A persistent CAD can lead to macroeconomic instability if not managed effectively.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAD is a key indicator of a country's external sector performance, reflecting the imbalance between its earnings from exports and payments for imports of goods and services.  Analyzing the CAD is crucial for understanding a country's trade position and its overall macroeconomic performance.  The CAD is a major component of a country's balance of payments.


**17. With reference to India's fisheries sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the world’s largest fish producer.
2. World Fisheries Day is observed on November 21st.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is the world's *second* largest fish producer, not the largest.  While India has a significant fisheries sector, its production is surpassed by another country (China).  Understanding India's ranking in global fish production is important for assessing its role in the global food security landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. World Fisheries Day is indeed observed every year on November 21st.  The date is significant for raising awareness about the importance of sustainable fisheries management and conservation efforts.  The annual observance highlights the need for responsible practices to ensure the long-term health of aquatic ecosystems.


**18. With reference to National Waterways (NWs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. NW 3 is located on the Barak River.
2. NW 1 is located on the Ganga River.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. National Waterway 3 (NW-3) is indeed located on the Barak River.  The Barak River is an important waterway in the Northeast region of India and is part of India's inland waterway network. The designation of NW-3 highlights the government's focus on developing inland waterways for transportation.

Statement 2 is correct. National Waterway 1 (NW-1) is located on the Ganga River.  The Ganga River is one of India's most significant rivers, and the NW-1 designation reflects the importance of this waterway for transportation and economic development.  The development of NW-1 plays a significant role in improving connectivity in the Ganga basin.


**19. With reference to medical tourism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Long wait times for treatment contribute significantly to the growth of medical tourism in India.
2. Cost-effective treatment is a major factor driving medical tourism in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Long wait times for treatment in other countries are a *push* factor for patients seeking medical care elsewhere, but it is not a *pull* factor that directly contributes to the growth of medical tourism *in* India.  Medical tourism in India is driven by factors such as quality of care and cost-effectiveness, not the inefficiency of healthcare systems in other countries.

Statement 2 is correct.  Cost-effective treatment is a major driver of medical tourism in India.  Compared to many developed countries, medical treatment in India is significantly more affordable, making it an attractive destination for patients seeking cost-effective healthcare solutions.  The cost advantage attracts patients seeking to reduce the expense of medical care.

**1. With reference to Bitcoin, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism relies on a distributed network of miners solving complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.  This process consumes significant energy.
2.  The Bitcoin halving event, which occurs approximately every four years, reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, impacting its inflation rate and potentially its market value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bitcoin's core functionality depends on its Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.  Miners compete to solve computationally intensive cryptographic problems. The first miner to solve the puzzle adds a new block of validated transactions to the blockchain and receives a reward in Bitcoin. This process is energy-intensive due to the computational power required.  The decentralized nature of the network ensures its security and resilience against attacks, but this comes at the cost of substantial energy consumption.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Bitcoin halving is a programmed event built into the Bitcoin protocol. It cuts the block reward paid to miners in half.  This halving event occurs approximately every 210,000 blocks, which translates to roughly four years.  The reduction in new Bitcoin creation directly affects the inflation rate of the cryptocurrency.  Historically, halving events have been followed by periods of increased price volatility, although the long-term impact on price is a subject of ongoing debate among economists and market analysts. The reduced supply, in theory, should increase scarcity and potentially drive up the price, but other market factors also play a significant role.


**2. With reference to Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalaram Temple Entry Satyagraha, led by Ambedkar, successfully secured equal access to all temples for Dalits within a year of its commencement.
2.  Ambedkar's advocacy resulted in the explicit abolition of untouchability, a practice deeply entrenched in the Hindu caste system, being enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ambedkar led the Kalaram Temple Entry Satyagraha in 1930, aiming to challenge the caste-based restrictions on temple entry for Dalits, it didn't immediately lead to complete and nationwide success. The struggle for equal access to temples continued for many years after this event, and the complete eradication of this practice remains a work in progress.  The Satyagraha highlighted the discriminatory practices but didn't achieve its stated objective within a short timeframe.

Statement 2 is correct.  Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar played a pivotal role in the drafting of the Indian Constitution. His relentless advocacy for Dalit rights significantly influenced the inclusion of Article 17, which explicitly abolishes untouchability. This constitutional provision was a landmark achievement in the fight against caste-based discrimination, though its full implementation remains a challenge even today.  The inclusion of Article 17 represents a legal and constitutional commitment to ending untouchability, a significant legacy of Ambedkar's work.


**3. With reference to the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ASI, conducted annually since 1959, covers all manufacturing establishments registered under the Factories Act, 1948, irrespective of their size or ownership structure.
2.  The 2022-23 ASI data demonstrated a negative correlation between the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and the performance of the manufacturing sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ASI has been conducted since 1959 and covers factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948, it doesn't encompass *all* manufacturing establishments.  There are criteria for inclusion based on factors like employment size and other specified parameters. The ASI aims for a representative sample of the manufacturing sector, not a complete census of every single unit.  The statement oversimplifies the scope and coverage of the survey.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2022-23 ASI data, as reported in the news, actually showed a *positive* correlation between the PLI scheme and sectoral performance. This indicates that the incentive scheme positively impacted the performance of the incentivized sectors. The statement presents the opposite of the actual finding, serving as a significant distractor.  The positive correlation suggests the PLI scheme's effectiveness in stimulating growth within specific sectors.


**4. With reference to coconut plantations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Coconut trees thrive in regions with high rainfall (above 3000 mm annually), necessitating irrigation in areas with lower rainfall.
2.  Extensive coconut cultivation in Pacific atolls has contributed significantly to deforestation and environmental degradation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While coconut trees prefer humid conditions and substantial rainfall, the specified annual rainfall requirement of over 3000 mm is exaggerated.  The optimal annual rainfall for coconut cultivation is typically between 1500 to 2500 mm.  Areas with lower rainfall might require supplemental irrigation, but the statement's high figure is inaccurate and misleading.  The ideal range falls within the lower limit mentioned in the provided text.

Statement 2 is correct. The expansion of coconut plantations in many Pacific atolls has resulted in substantial deforestation. This deforestation contributes to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and exacerbates the vulnerability of these low-lying islands to climate change impacts like sea-level rise.  The text explicitly mentions deforestation as a significant consequence of extensive coconut cultivation in the Pacific region.  This highlights the environmental challenges associated with large-scale monoculture farming.


**5. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's FDI inflows have surpassed $2 trillion in the period between April 2000 and September 2024.
2.  FDI is currently permitted in all sectors of the Indian economy, reflecting a completely open investment policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that FDI inflows into India have surpassed the $1 trillion mark (not $2 trillion) between April 2000 and September 2024.  The statement inflates the actual figure, creating a significant numerical distractor.  The actual figure is considerably lower than the one presented in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India has significantly liberalized its FDI policies over the years, FDI remains prohibited in certain sectors. The text explicitly mentions that FDI is prohibited in sectors such as lottery, gambling, betting, chit funds, Nidhi companies, and the manufacturing of certain tobacco products.  The statement wrongly implies a completely unrestricted FDI policy.  The existence of prohibited sectors demonstrates that India's FDI policy is not entirely open.


**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI was established on the recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission and commenced operations in 1936.
2.  Sanjay Malhotra's appointment as the next RBI governor was approved by the Parliament of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI's establishment was indeed based on the recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission. However, the commencement of its operations was in 1935, not 1936, as stated in the question.  The error in the year is a subtle but significant factual inaccuracy. The commission's recommendations were instrumental in shaping the structure and functions of the central bank.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The appointment of the RBI governor is approved by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), headed by the Prime Minister, not by the Parliament.  This highlights a crucial difference between executive and legislative powers in the Indian governmental structure. The ACC's decision is a key step in the appointment process.


**7. With reference to Cess and Surcharge, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cess is always earmarked for specific purposes, while surcharge is a revenue-generating measure without any specific allocation.
2.  Both Cess and Surcharge are levied on top of the basic tax liability, increasing the overall tax burden.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While both cess and surcharge are additional levies, cess is generally earmarked for specific purposes, such as education or health, while surcharge is often a more general revenue-raising measure without a designated allocation.  The distinction lies primarily in the intended use of the funds collected.  There might be exceptions, but the general principle holds true.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Both cess and surcharge are levied in addition to the base tax amount, thereby increasing the total tax payable by the taxpayer.  This accurately reflects their function as supplementary tax components.  The statement correctly captures their impact on the overall tax liability.


**8. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  An asset is classified as an NPA if the principal and/or interest remains overdue for more than 180 days.
2.  For agricultural loans, the overdue period for classifying an asset as NPA is extended to three crop seasons for short-duration crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  According to the RBI guidelines, an asset is classified as an NPA if the interest and/or installment of principal remains overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days as stated. This is a crucial detail in understanding NPA classification.  The 90-day threshold is the key criterion for determining an NPA.

Statement 2 is correct.  For agricultural loans, the period for classifying an asset as an NPA is indeed extended.  It's two crop seasons for short-duration crops and one crop season for long-duration crops, not three as mentioned in the statement.  The extension acknowledges the unique characteristics of agricultural cycles and repayment patterns. The adjustment reflects the realities of agricultural finance.


**9. With reference to the Jalvahak scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jalvahak scheme provides a 50% reimbursement of operating expenses for cargo transported via national waterways.
2. The scheme is a joint initiative of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) and the Inland & Coastal Shipping Limited (ICSL).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jalvahak scheme offers up to 35% reimbursement of operating expenses, not 50%, for cargo transported via specified national waterways. This is a significant difference in the financial incentive provided.  The actual percentage is lower than what's stated.

Statement 2 is correct.  The scheme is indeed a joint initiative between the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) and Inland & Coastal Shipping Limited (ICSL). This collaboration reflects the coordinated effort to promote inland waterway transport. The joint nature of the initiative underscores the collaborative approach.


**10. With reference to medical tourism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary driver of medical tourism in India is the significantly lower cost of treatment compared to developed nations.
2.  The long waiting times for medical procedures in India are a significant deterrent to medical tourists.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A major factor attracting medical tourists to India is the substantially lower cost of medical procedures and treatments compared to countries in the West, such as the US and Europe. This cost advantage is a primary reason for the growth of this sector.  The economic benefit is a significant draw for international patients.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  One of the key advantages of medical tourism in India is the often shorter waiting times for procedures compared to many Western healthcare systems.  The statement contradicts this well-known advantage.  The shorter waiting times are a significant attraction for medical tourists.


**11. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) determines the MSP for all agricultural commodities produced in India.
2.  MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season to provide price support to farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the CACP makes recommendations for MSPs, the final decision on which crops and what level of MSP rests with the government. The CACP's role is advisory, not definitive.  The government's decision-making process is a vital part of the MSP mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  MSPs are announced at the *beginning* of the sowing season, not the end of the harvesting season, to provide farmers with price certainty and to influence planting decisions.  The timing is crucial for farmers' planning and investment.  The announcement before the planting season is essential for its intended purpose.


**12. With reference to India's Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's SPR program is managed by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).
2.  The SPR program currently has a storage capacity of over 6.5 million metric tonnes of crude oil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The SPR program is managed by the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL), not ONGC.  This is a critical distinction in the institutional arrangement for managing the SPR.  The responsibility lies with a separate entity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The current storage capacity of India's SPR is 5.33 million metric tonnes, not over 6.5 million metric tonnes. The Phase II expansion aims to increase capacity to 6.5 MMT, but this hasn't yet been fully achieved. The statement incorrectly presents a future capacity as the present reality.  The actual capacity is lower than the stated figure.


**13. With reference to the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), consider the following statements:**

1.  A declining REER indicates that a country's currency has depreciated, making its exports more competitive.
2.  The REER is calculated using only the exchange rate of a country's currency against the US dollar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A declining REER signifies a depreciation of a country's currency relative to a weighted average of its major trading partners' currencies. This depreciation makes the country's exports cheaper and more attractive in international markets, improving its export competitiveness.  The depreciation's impact on exports is a key aspect of REER analysis.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The REER is not calculated solely against the US dollar. It considers a weighted average of the exchange rates against the currencies of a country's major trading partners, reflecting the broader international context.  The calculation involves multiple currencies, not just the US dollar.  The weighted average accounts for the relative importance of each trading partner.


**14. With reference to the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE), consider the following statements:**

1.  ASUSE covers all unincorporated establishments in India, including those in the agricultural sector.
2.  The 2023-24 ASUSE report showed a significant increase in the number of unincorporated non-agricultural establishments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ASUSE specifically excludes unincorporated agricultural establishments.  Its focus is on the non-agricultural unincorporated sector. The exclusion of agriculture is a defining feature of the survey's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2023-24 ASUSE report indeed indicated a substantial increase in the number of unincorporated non-agricultural establishments. This reflects trends in the growth and dynamics of this sector of the Indian economy. The growth figures are a key highlight of the report.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Council of Ministers in India:**

1.  The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Rajya Sabha, requiring its confidence to remain in power.
2.  The size of the Council of Ministers is explicitly defined in the Constitution of India, limiting its membership to a fixed number.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Council of Ministers in India is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha.  While the Rajya Sabha can influence legislation and scrutinize the government's actions, it does not hold the power to directly bring down the government through a no-confidence motion.  The Lok Sabha, being the lower house and representing the people directly, holds this power.  A vote of no confidence in the Lok Sabha can lead to the resignation or dismissal of the Council of Ministers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does *not* explicitly define the size of the Council of Ministers.  While the 91st Constitutional Amendment Act of 2003 indirectly limits the size of the Council of Ministers to 15% of the total strength of the Lok Sabha, this is not a hard limit and there have been instances of larger councils.  The actual size is largely a political decision and depends on various factors including the nature of the government (coalition or single-party) and the number of portfolios to be managed.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**2. With reference to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate money bills, while the Lok Sabha can only amend or reject them.
2.  Both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have equal powers in passing ordinary bills, but the Lok Sabha holds exclusive power in financial matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Money bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations on a money bill, which the Lok Sabha can accept or reject. The Lok Sabha has the final say on money bills.

Statement 2 is correct.  Both houses have equal powers in the passage of ordinary bills. However, the Lok Sabha has overriding powers in financial matters, including money bills and budget.  The Rajya Sabha's role is limited to making recommendations, which the Lok Sabha can choose to ignore.  The Lok Sabha's dominance in financial matters reflects its role as the house of the people, directly elected and representing the popular will.


**3. With reference to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), consider the following statements:**

1. The NIA's jurisdiction is limited to investigating crimes within the geographical boundaries of India.
2. The NIA Act, 2008, mandates that the NIA must seek prior approval from the President of India before initiating any investigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NIA's jurisdiction extends beyond India's geographical boundaries. It can investigate terrorist acts committed outside India if they involve Indian citizens or affect India's national security or interests. This wider jurisdiction is crucial in addressing transnational terrorism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NIA Act, 2008, does not mandate prior approval from the President before initiating investigations. The agency operates under its own delegated powers, but the Home Ministry provides overall oversight.  The President's role is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the NIA's investigations.  Therefore, neither statement is accurate.


**4. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1. Decisions of Lok Adalats are final and binding and cannot be challenged in any court of law.
2. Lok Adalats are primarily designed to handle cases involving non-compoundable offences, offering a speedy resolution mechanism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While decisions of Lok Adalats are generally final and binding, there are limited circumstances under which they can be challenged in higher courts, though such challenges are rare and only possible on specific grounds of procedural irregularities or manifest injustice.  The aim is to provide a quick and efficient resolution, but the finality is not absolute.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lok Adalats primarily handle compoundable offences, civil disputes, and certain types of criminal cases where a compromise is possible. They are *not* designed for non-compoundable offences, which typically require a formal trial in a regular court. The focus is on amicable settlements and reducing the burden on the formal judicial system.  Thus, neither statement is correct.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Goods and Services Tax (GST):**

1. The GST Council is headed by the Vice President of India, reflecting the federal structure of the Indian government.
2.  The GST Network (GSTN) is a private company responsible for the IT infrastructure of the GST system.  

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is headed by the Union Finance Minister, not the Vice President. The Vice President's role is primarily related to the legislative branch as the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. The Union Finance Minister's chairmanship of the GST Council reflects the central government's role in coordinating GST implementation across states.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  While GSTN was initially a not-for-profit company, it has since been converted into a government company, with the government holding 100% of its shares.  Therefore, it is now fully owned and controlled by the government. Though the original statement is partially correct, the current status is not reflected.  Thus, only statement 2 is partially correct.


**6. With reference to India's public debt, consider the following statements:**

1. Public debt in India is solely constituted by external borrowings from international financial institutions.
2.  The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, aims to manage public debt but does not set any specific targets or limits for it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's public debt is primarily composed of *internal* debt (borrowings from domestic sources), with a smaller portion being external debt.  The composition of public debt can vary depending on factors like global economic conditions and domestic borrowing needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FRBM Act, 2003, aims to manage public debt and fiscal deficit by setting targets and limits for these indicators.  The act aims for fiscal consolidation and responsible borrowing practices, although these targets may be adjusted based on economic circumstances. Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**7.  With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are primarily responsible for acquiring only performing assets from banks and financial institutions.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does not have any regulatory oversight over the functioning of ARCs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs primarily acquire *non-performing assets* (NPAs) or bad loans from banks and financial institutions, helping them clean up their balance sheets.  The acquisition of performing assets is not their primary function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI plays a significant role in regulating the functioning of ARCs in India.  The RBI issues directions and guidelines to govern their operations, ensuring transparency and accountability in the asset reconstruction process. This regulatory framework is crucial for maintaining the stability of the financial system.  Hence, neither statement is correct.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Council of Ministers and the President of India:**

1. The President of India can dismiss the Council of Ministers without any consultation or advice from any other body.
2. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who then advises the President on the appointment of other ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President has the power to dismiss the Council of Ministers, they typically do so on the advice of the Prime Minister, reflecting the convention of parliamentary democracy.  The President's power is largely discretionary, but they are bound by constitutional conventions.  The dismissal of a council of ministers without any consultation would be an unusual and potentially controversial action.

Statement 2 is correct. The President appoints the Prime Minister (usually the leader of the party with a majority in the Lok Sabha).  The Prime Minister then advises the President on the appointment of other ministers, forming the Council of Ministers. This process reflects the balance of power between the head of state (President) and the head of government (Prime Minister).  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to India's Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), consider the following statements:**

1. The Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment scheme was first introduced in 2023-24 to address the slowdown in state CAPEX.
2. The 15th Finance Commission's allocation of central taxes and duties determines the distribution of funds under Part-I of the Special Assistance scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment scheme was initially introduced in 2020-21 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, not in 2023-24.  While the scheme continued in 2023-24, its genesis was earlier.

Statement 2 is correct. The allocation of funds under Part I of the Special Assistance scheme is based on the states' share of central taxes and duties as determined by the 15th Finance Commission's award. This ensures a fair distribution of resources among the states.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s annual report on State Finances, consider the following statements:**

1. The report for 2023-24 focuses on the revenue dynamics and fiscal capacity of Indian states and showed an increase in the consolidated gross fiscal deficit to GDP ratio.
2.  The report highlighted a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio of states from 31% at the end of March 2021 to 27.5% by the end of March 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI report for 2023-24 did focus on revenue dynamics and fiscal capacity, it highlighted a *decline* in the consolidated gross fiscal deficit to GDP ratio, not an increase.  The report showed positive trends in fiscal consolidation.

Statement 2 is correct. The report accurately reflects the decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio of states during the specified period, indicating improved fiscal health. This is a key finding of the report, showing positive fiscal management.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCRB directly reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs and is responsible for collecting and analyzing crime data nationwide.
2.  The NCRB's establishment was primarily based on the recommendations of the Tandon Committee and the National Police Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) oversees the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The NCRB's core function is the collection, compilation, and analysis of crime data across India.  This data is crucial for understanding crime trends and informing policing strategies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCRB's foundation was based on the recommendations of several committees, the Tandon Committee and the National Police Commission were not the primary sources.  The foundation of the NCRB involved recommendations from multiple committees focusing on police reform and criminal justice system improvements, making a single attribution inaccurate. The actual committees involved in the NCRB's creation are not explicitly listed in the provided text.  This highlights the importance of avoiding oversimplification when dealing with complex historical processes.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to evaluate incomplete information.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Verma Committee:**

1.  The Verma Committee's primary focus was on reforming the criminal justice system, including police reforms and judicial improvements.
2.  The Verma Committee's recommendations directly led to the formulation of the current laws regarding Fundamental Duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Verma Committee's work significantly addressed issues within the criminal justice system.  Although the specific details of its recommendations are not provided, the context suggests a focus on improving police efficiency and the judiciary's effectiveness.  This is a common theme in Indian legal reform discussions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Verma Committee's purview did not directly encompass Fundamental Duties. While the committee might have touched upon relevant legal provisions, it's inaccurate to state that its recommendations directly shaped the current legislation on Fundamental Duties.  The question tests the ability to analyze the scope and limitations of a specific committee's work, demanding precise factual recall.  The inclusion of Fundamental Duties as a distractor tests the candidate's broader understanding of Indian constitutional law.


**3. With reference to the Punchhi Commission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Punchhi Commission's work directly followed up on the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission, focusing on Centre-State relations.
2.  Madan Mohan Punchhi chaired the Punchhi Commission, and its investigations primarily focused on electoral reforms and the strengthening of the Election Commission of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Punchhi Commission's work built upon the earlier Sarkaria Commission's study of Centre-State relations. This sequential relationship reflects the ongoing evolution of intergovernmental relations in India. The question assesses understanding of the relationship between different governmental bodies and their areas of focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Madan Mohan Punchhi indeed chaired the Punchhi Commission, its focus was not primarily on electoral reforms or the Election Commission. The Commission's main area of investigation was Centre-State relations, a key issue in Indian governance.  The distractor regarding electoral reforms tests the candidate's knowledge of other relevant commissions and their mandates.


**4. With reference to the Protected Area Permit (PAP), consider the following statements:**

1.  Only citizens of India require a PAP to visit the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh.
2.  Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are exempt from needing a PAP to visit Arunachal Pradesh, but Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders require it.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A PAP is required for foreign nationals, not just Indian citizens, to visit certain restricted areas within Arunachal Pradesh. The statement incorrectly restricts the need for a PAP to only Indian citizens.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The requirement of a PAP generally applies to foreign nationals, including NRIs, PIOs, and OCIs.  The statement incorrectly suggests differential treatment based on citizenship status.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between different categories of individuals and their legal standing.  The use of specific categories (NRIs, PIOs, OCIs) serves as a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge of Indian immigration regulations.


**5. With reference to the Joint Committee of Parliament (JPC), consider the following statements:**

1.  A JPC is a permanent committee of Parliament, continuously functioning to oversee government actions.
2.  The recommendations of a JPC are binding on the government and must be implemented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A JPC is not a permanent committee; it is constituted for specific purposes and dissolved once its task is completed.  The statement incorrectly portrays JPCs as permanent bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The recommendations of a JPC are not binding on the government. They carry significant weight, but the government retains the discretion to accept, reject, or modify them. The question tests understanding of the nature and function of JPCs, emphasizing the distinction between advisory and binding recommendations.  The distractor regarding the binding nature of JPC recommendations tests the candidate's understanding of parliamentary procedures.


**6. With reference to judicial accountability in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A judge can be removed only for "proved misbehavior or incapacity," and the process requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament.
2.  The removal of a judge is determined by a committee that includes the Chief Justice of India but excludes the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that a judge can only be removed for "proved misbehavior or incapacity." However, the process does not require a two-thirds majority in both houses; rather, it involves a motion passed by a special majority in the Parliament. This highlights the need for precise recall of constitutional provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The process of removing a judge involves a committee that includes the Chief Justice of India, but the Prime Minister is not a member of this committee. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the judicial removal process and the composition of the relevant committee. The distractor regarding the two-thirds majority tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between different types of majorities required in parliamentary procedures.


**7. With reference to the Good Governance Index, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Good Governance Index is released annually by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
2.  The Index covers all states and union territories of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Good Governance Index is released by NITI Aayog, not the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The question tests the ability to recall the correct releasing authority of the index.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Index does not cover all states and union territories annually; the specific number of states and union territories covered may vary. The statement incorrectly claims comprehensive coverage. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the scope and limitations of the Good Governance Index.  The distractors test the candidate's knowledge of government organizations and their functions.


**8.  Consider the following statements concerning the CBI's investigative powers:**

1. The CBI requires specific consent from a state government to investigate crimes within that state, except in cases involving Union government employees.
2.  The Supreme Court can direct the CBI to investigate crimes in any state without requiring prior consent from the state government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While the CBI can investigate crimes involving Union government employees without specific state consent, for other crimes, it generally requires such consent from the respective state government under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. The statement is a simplification of a complex legal reality.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court possesses the authority to direct the CBI to investigate crimes anywhere in India, overriding the need for state government consent. This power stems from the Supreme Court's inherent powers and its role in upholding the rule of law.  The question tests understanding of the checks and balances within the Indian legal system and the Supreme Court's role in overseeing investigations. The distractor in statement 1, concerning Union government employees, tests the candidate's detailed understanding of CBI's jurisdiction.


**9. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule grants significant legislative, judicial, and administrative autonomy to the Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) within the specified states.
2.  The Sixth Schedule applies only to the state of Assam, excluding other northeastern states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule empowers ADCs in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura with considerable autonomy in legislative, judicial, and administrative matters concerning the tribal areas under their jurisdiction. This reflects the constitutional recognition of the unique needs of tribal communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule's application extends beyond Assam to Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the geographical scope of the Sixth Schedule and its provisions for tribal self-governance. The distractor in statement 2, concerning the limited application to Assam, tests the candidate's understanding of the Sixth Schedule's coverage of other Northeastern states.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Lok Sabha Speaker presides over the joint sittings of both houses of Parliament convened by the President.
2. The Lok Sabha has the sole power to initiate a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In a joint sitting of both houses of Parliament, the Lok Sabha Speaker presides. This reflects the Lok Sabha's dominance in the event of a deadlock between the two houses.

Statement 2 is correct. Only the Lok Sabha can initiate a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers.  This is a crucial aspect of the Lok Sabha's power to hold the executive accountable.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the Lok Sabha's role and powers within the Indian parliamentary system.  The structure of the question tests the examinee's understanding of  the relationship between the Lok Sabha and the executive branch of government.



**11. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court on the basis of seniority alone.
2. The President can withhold assent to any bill passed by Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President appoints the judges, the process involves consultation and consideration of factors beyond mere seniority.  The appointment of judges to the higher judiciary is a complex process involving several stakeholders, including the collegium system.  The statement incorrectly simplifies the appointment process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President has the power to withhold assent to a bill passed by Parliament, although this power is rarely exercised and is usually subject to political and constitutional constraints.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the President's role in the legislative process and the limitations on that role. The distractor in statement 1 tests the examinee's understanding of the judicial appointments process.


**12. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor is appointed by the President for a term of five years, but can be removed before the completion of the term.
2. The Governor's power to reserve a bill for the President's consideration is absolute and cannot be influenced by the State Council of Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The President appoints the Governor for a five-year term, and the President also has the power to remove the Governor before the term's completion.  The statement correctly reflects the constitutional position of the Governor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor does have the power to reserve a bill, this power is not absolute and can be influenced by the State Council of Ministers' advice.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the Governor's powers and the checks and balances within the state's governmental structure. The distractor in statement 2 tests the candidate's knowledge of the relationship between the Governor and the state government.


**13. Consider the following statements about the Rajya Sabha:**

1. The Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers.
2.  The Vice-President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to initiate a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers; this power is exclusively vested in the Lok Sabha. The statement incorrectly attributes this power to the Rajya Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vice-President of India holds the ex-officio position of Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the Rajya Sabha's role and powers within the Indian parliamentary system and its relationship with the executive branch of government.  The distractor in statement 1 tests the candidate's knowledge of the Lok Sabha's exclusive power to initiate a no-confidence motion.


**14. With reference to the NITI Aayog, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, and its primary function is to prepare five-year plans for the Indian economy.
2. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio Chairperson of NITI Aayog.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NITI Aayog did replace the Planning Commission, its function is not solely to prepare five-year plans.  It adopts a more cooperative and collaborative approach to development planning. The statement incorrectly attributes the primary function of NITI Aayog.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister of India serves as the ex-officio Chairperson of NITI Aayog.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of NITI Aayog's role in the Indian governance system and its relationship with the executive branch.  The distractor in statement 1 tests the candidate's knowledge of the differences between the Planning Commission and NITI Aayog.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024 mandates the merger of the Indian Railway Board Act, 1905, and the Railways Act, 1989, to streamline railway governance.
2.  The proposed independent regulator for Indian Railways will have exclusive authority over tariff determination, excluding safety and private sector participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to merge the Indian Railway Board Act, 1905, into the Railways Act, 1989. This consolidation simplifies the legal framework governing Indian Railways, addressing the anomaly of the Railway Board operating without statutory backing since its inception.  The merger streamlines the regulatory structure and reduces redundancy in legislation. This reflects a broader government trend towards consolidating and rationalizing laws for improved governance and efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the proposed independent regulator will indeed oversee tariff matters, its authority is not limited to tariffs alone.  The provided source clearly states that the regulator's purview includes safety and private sector participation in Indian Railways. This broader mandate reflects the need for comprehensive oversight of various aspects of railway operations, ensuring accountability and transparency in decision-making concerning safety, efficiency and market participation.  The regulator's role is not a narrow one focused solely on pricing.


**2. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC Chairperson is appointed by the President of India for a five-year term,  with no provision for reappointment.
2.  The NHRC has the power to investigate human rights violations only in cases involving violations of fundamental rights explicitly enumerated in Part III of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NHRC Chairperson is appointed by the President of India, the provided text doesn't specify a five-year term or prohibit reappointment. The term length is not explicitly mentioned in the given information.  The process of appointment, including the term length and eligibility for reappointment, involves complexities related to constitutional provisions and established conventions, which are not detailed in the given excerpt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC's mandate extends beyond investigating violations of only the fundamental rights listed in Part III of the Constitution.  The source material indicates that the NHRC protects and promotes human rights as defined in the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993, encompassing rights relating to life, liberty, equality, and dignity of the individual, whether guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in international covenants and enforceable by Indian courts.  This broader scope encompasses a wider range of human rights issues than those strictly defined under Part III.


**3. With reference to the power to pardon in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can independently grant a pardon in cases involving offences against any law relating to a matter where the executive power of the Union extends.
2.  Judicial review of the President's pardon power is limited to cases where the decision is demonstrably arbitrary, capricious, or mala fide, based on the Maru Ram case precedent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Maru Ram v. Union of India (1980) Supreme Court judgment established that the President of India cannot exercise the pardon power independently. The President must act on the advice of the Union government (the Centre).  This reflects the principle of responsible governance, where the executive branch's actions are subject to checks and balances, even in the exercise of significant powers like granting pardons.  The President's role is largely ceremonial in this context.

Statement 2 is correct. The Maru Ram case significantly shaped the scope of judicial review of the President's pardon power.  The court ruled that intervention would only be warranted in exceptional circumstances, namely, when the decision is demonstrably "wholly irrelevant, irrational, discriminatory, or mala fide." This high threshold reflects the courts' deference to the executive's prerogative in matters of clemency, unless there is clear evidence of abuse of power or gross injustice.  The courts generally avoid interfering with the executive's discretionary powers unless there's a clear violation of fundamental rights or due process.


**4. With reference to the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India has the sole authority to initiate the process of removing a judge based on a motion passed by either House of Parliament.
2. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha plays a crucial role in determining the merit of a motion for the removal of a judge before forwarding it to the President.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, does not vest the President of India with the sole authority to initiate the removal of a judge. The process begins with a motion in either House of Parliament.  The President's role is subsequent—to act upon the motion's outcome after an inquiry. This reflects the principle of separation of powers, with the legislature initiating the process and the executive (President) acting upon the findings of the inquiry.  The President does not have the power to initiate the process on their own.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha holds a crucial gatekeeping function under the Judges Inquiry Act. They have the discretion to admit or reject a motion for removal.  Before proceeding, they can consult individuals and examine relevant material to ascertain the motion's merit. This prevents frivolous or politically motivated motions from reaching the President, preserving the integrity of the judicial process.  Their role is vital in ensuring that only well-founded motions proceed.


**5. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCI operates under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, aiming to foster a competitive market environment in India.
2. The CCI's composition includes a Chairperson and a minimum of six other members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCI operates under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. This placement reflects the CCI's focus on corporate governance and market regulations related to business entities. The ministry's jurisdiction is relevant to the CCI's mandate of ensuring fair competition within the corporate sector.  The correct ministry is crucial for understanding the CCI's operational context and its relationship to other regulatory bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CCI's composition includes a Chairperson and *not less than two and not more than six* other members.  The minimum number of members is two, not six.  This range allows for flexibility in the CCI's structure, adapting to the complexity of competition-related issues and ensuring effective decision-making.  The precise range is significant for understanding the CCI's decision-making structure and capacity.


**6. With reference to the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), consider the following statements:**

1. Article 44 of the Constitution mandates the immediate implementation of a Uniform Civil Code throughout India.
2.  A UCC aims to replace existing personal laws based on religious affiliations, covering matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 44 of the Constitution does *not* mandate the immediate implementation of a UCC but directs the state to "endeavour to secure" a UCC.  This phrasing indicates a policy goal, not a legally binding obligation.  The "endeavour" clause signifies that the implementation of a UCC is subject to political and social considerations, unlike a mandatory provision.  The distinction between a directive principle and a mandatory provision is crucial.

Statement 2 is correct. The core objective of a UCC is to replace the diverse personal laws based on religious affiliations.  It seeks to create a uniform legal framework governing personal matters like marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession for all citizens, irrespective of their religious beliefs. This reflects the principle of equality before the law, aiming for a more cohesive and equitable legal system.  The scope and coverage of a UCC are key aspects of its design and intent.


**7. With reference to the Henderson Doctrine, consider the following statements:**

1. The Henderson Doctrine, originating from an 1843 English case, establishes the principle of constructive res judicata, preventing relitigation of issues decided in prior proceedings.
2. The Henderson Doctrine is a purely English legal principle and has no application in the Indian legal system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Henderson Doctrine, stemming from the 1843 English case *Henderson v. Henderson*, is a principle that prevents the relitigation of issues already decided or that could have been raised in previous legal proceedings. This is closely linked to the concept of res judicata, which prevents repeated litigation of the same matter.  The doctrine promotes finality in judgments and efficient use of judicial resources.  It's a fundamental principle of legal systems worldwide.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While originating in English law, the Henderson Doctrine finds application within the Indian legal system. The provided text explicitly mentions that it's a natural corollary of the Indian doctrine of constructive res judicata, codified in Explanation IV of Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).  This indicates the doctrine's integration into Indian jurisprudence, reflecting the influence of common law principles on Indian legal frameworks. The applicability of the doctrine in India is a key aspect to understand.


**8. With reference to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCRB was established in the 1990s under the Ministry of Home Affairs to improve data collection and analysis related to crime in India.
2. The Tandon Committee's recommendations in the 1970s directly led to the establishment of the NCRB.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCRB was established in 1986, not in the 1990s. While its mandate is indeed to improve crime data collection and analysis, the timeframe is inaccurate.  Precision in dates is crucial for UPSC questions on historical and institutional developments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Tandon Committee, formed in the 1970s, recommended the creation of a national crime records bureau.  This recommendation directly contributed to the establishment of the NCRB, highlighting the importance of expert committees in shaping policy and institutional development in India. The committee's role is a significant factor in understanding the NCRB's origins.  The National Police Commission (1977-1981) also emphasized the need for such a body.


**9. With reference to Protected Area Permits (PAPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All foreign nationals require a PAP to visit any part of Himachal Pradesh.
2.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area, requiring all foreign nationals to obtain a PAP before entry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While some areas within Himachal Pradesh may require PAPs for foreign nationals, the entire state is not under the Protected Area regime. This reflects the varied security and environmental sensitivities across different regions of India.  The statement incorrectly generalizes the PAP requirement for the entire state.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text clearly states that the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh falls under the Protected Area regime, mandating PAPs for all foreign nationals. This reflects the security concerns associated with Arunachal Pradesh's proximity to international borders.  The complete coverage of Arunachal Pradesh under the PAP regime is a key fact.  Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Sikkim have some areas that require a PAP, not the entire state.


**10. With reference to the Joint Committee of Parliament (JPC), consider the following statements:**

1. A JPC is a permanent committee of Parliament, with members appointed for a fixed five-year term.
2.  Recommendations of a JPC are binding on the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A JPC is not a permanent committee; it is formed for specific purposes, such as detailed scrutiny of a subject or Bill, and is dissolved once its task is completed.  The temporary nature of JPCs reflects their focused mandates and ensures they do not become entrenched bureaucratic bodies.  The statement mistakenly presents JPCs as permanent fixtures.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A JPC's recommendations are not legally binding on the government.  While they carry considerable weight and persuasive value, the government retains the discretion to accept or reject them.  This reflects the separation of powers and the government's ultimate responsibility for policy decisions.  The non-binding nature of recommendations emphasizes the advisory role of JPCs.  The government is expected to report back on actions taken in response to the recommendations.


**11. With reference to Adjournment sine die, consider the following statements:**

1. Adjournment sine die refers to the indefinite postponement of a parliamentary session, with a specific date set for the next meeting.
2. The power to adjourn sine die rests solely with the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Adjournment sine die signifies the termination of a parliamentary sitting without specifying a date for the next meeting; it's an indefinite adjournment, not a postponement with a pre-determined resumption date.  The lack of a specified resumption date is a crucial aspect of this parliamentary procedure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The power to adjourn sine die rests with the Presiding Officer of the House (Speaker for Lok Sabha or Chairman for Rajya Sabha), not the President of India. This reflects the Houses' autonomy in managing their internal affairs.  The President's role is distinct from the day-to-day functioning of Parliament's sessions. The Presiding Officer can reconvene the House at any time after an adjournment sine die.


**12. With reference to the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act decriminalizes over 200 provisions across 50 laws.
2. The Act introduces a mechanism for a 10% increase in the minimum amount of fines and penalties every five years for various offences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Vishwas Act decriminalizes 183 provisions across 42 laws, not over 200 provisions across 50 laws.  The precise number of provisions and laws affected is a key detail of the Act.  The statement exaggerates the scale of decriminalization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act mandates a periodic revision of fines and penalties, increasing the minimum amount by 10% every *three* years, not five. The frequency of revision is a critical aspect of the Act's impact. The statement mistakenly increases the time interval.  The periodic revision aims to keep penalties relevant and effective over time.


**13. With reference to Transfer Pricing and the Arm's Length Principle (ALP), consider the following statements:**

1. In India, the Income Tax Department determines the arm's length price (ALP) in transfer pricing disputes, and this decision is final and non-appealable.
2. The Supreme Court's recent ruling allows for judicial review of ALP determinations only when they are demonstrably justified under the relevant transfer pricing provisions of the Income Tax Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Assessing Officer initially determines the ALP, the decision is not final and non-appealable.  The provided text clarifies that appeals can be made to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT).  Furthermore, the Supreme Court's ruling allows for further appeals to the High Court under certain circumstances.  The appeal process is a critical aspect of transfer pricing dispute resolution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's ruling allows for judicial review of ALP determinations when they are considered 'perverse' or outside the purview of relevant transfer pricing provisions.  This means the determination must be demonstrably unjust or not in accordance with the law, not simply justified under the provisions. The statement misrepresents the criteria for judicial review.  The Supreme Court's decision restores the ability to challenge ITAT decisions in High Courts.


**14. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. India ranked among the top 20 countries in the GII 2023, published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
2.  The GII is co-published by Cornell University, INSEAD Business School, and WIPO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India ranked 40th, not among the top 20, in the GII 2023.  The precise ranking is a crucial detail of the report's findings. The statement significantly misrepresents India's position in the ranking.

Statement 2 is correct. The GII is indeed co-published annually by Cornell University, INSEAD Business School, and WIPO.  The co-publication reflects the multi-disciplinary nature of innovation assessment, involving expertise in economics, business, and intellectual property.  The organizations involved are a key aspect of the index's credibility.


**15. With reference to Startups in India and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce's report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report highlights that only 10% of patent applications filed by Indian startups have been granted patents.
2.  The report recommends the establishment of a single implementation agency for all startup-related schemes and initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report indicates that only 11%, not 10%, of patent applications filed by startups have been granted patents. This highlights a significant challenge in the Indian startup ecosystem, where securing intellectual property protection remains a hurdle.  The statement provides an inaccurate percentage.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report indeed recommends the establishment of a single implementation agency for all startup-related schemes and initiatives to streamline their execution.  Currently, multiple ministries and departments oversee these, leading to potential inefficiencies and coordination issues. This reflects a common concern about bureaucratic fragmentation hindering effective policy implementation. The recommendation points to a potential reform for better coordination.


**16. With reference to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIS was established under the BIS Act, 2016, replacing the Indian Standards Institution (ISI).
2.  The BIS operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution and currently mandates quality norms for over 600 product categories.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIS was established under the BIS Act, 1986, and later restructured by the BIS Act, 2016.  The initial establishment date is crucial for understanding the BIS's historical evolution. The statement mistakenly provides the later restructuring date.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the BIS does operate under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, the number of product categories under mandatory quality norms is approximately 560, not over 600.  The precise number of products under mandatory certification is a key aspect of the BIS's regulatory reach.  The statement provides an exaggerated number.  Additionally, the text states that 115 more categories will be added, bringing the total to around 675.



**17. With reference to Article 3 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India can unilaterally form a new state by separating territory from an existing state without the consent of the State Legislature.
2.  A bill for forming a new state must be introduced in either House of Parliament only after receiving the President's recommendation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 3 empowers Parliament to form new states or alter the boundaries of existing ones. However, it doesn't grant the President unilateral power.  If a bill affects a state's area, boundaries, or name, the President must consult that State Legislature. This reflects the federal structure of India's governance, requiring consultation with affected states.  The statement misrepresents the President's role as purely unilateral.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 mandates that a bill concerning the formation of new states or alteration of existing ones must be introduced in Parliament on the recommendation of the President. This ensures that the executive branch plays a crucial role in the process, reflecting the importance of this constitutional provision. The President's recommendation is a crucial procedural step.



**18. With reference to the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act abolishes the Delhi Legislative Assembly's legislative powers over matters related to services.
2. The Act establishes a National Capital Civil Services Authority (NCCSA) to make recommendations to the Lieutenant Governor (LG) regarding matters such as transfer and posting of officers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act does *not* abolish the Delhi Legislative Assembly's legislative powers over services.  While it enhances the LG's role in certain service-related matters, it does not completely eliminate the Assembly's competence.  The statement incorrectly implies a complete removal of legislative power.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act creates the NCCSA, a statutory authority responsible for making recommendations to the LG on matters such as the transfer, posting, and vigilance of civil service officers in Delhi.  The establishment of the NCCSA is a central feature of the Act, altering the power dynamics between the elected government and the LG.  The creation of this body is a key change.



**19. With reference to Preventive Detention, consider the following statements:**

1.  Preventive detention requires a court trial and conviction before a person can be detained.
2.  State legislatures can enact laws on preventive detention for reasons connected with the defence, foreign affairs, and security of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Preventive detention, by definition, involves detaining a person *without* a trial or conviction. The preventive nature of the detention lies in preventing potential future harm, not punishing past actions. The absence of a trial is a defining characteristic.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Parliament, not state legislatures, has the exclusive power to enact laws on preventive detention for reasons connected with the defence, foreign affairs, and security of India.  State legislatures can concurrently make laws for reasons connected with the security of a state, maintenance of public order, and maintenance of supplies and services.  The distinction between the legislative powers of Parliament and state legislatures regarding preventive detention is crucial.



**20. With reference to Personality Rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Personality rights are explicitly defined and protected under Article 22 of the Constitution.
2.  The right to publicity, a component of personality rights, is primarily governed by the Copyright Act, 1957.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Personality rights are not explicitly defined in Article 22 of the Constitution.  Article 22 deals with protection against arrest and detention.  The protection of personality rights is derived from the right to privacy (Article 21) and the right to property.  The statement misattributes the constitutional basis for personality rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Copyright Act, 1957, does offer *some* protection related to personality rights, it is not the primary governing statute for the right to publicity. The right to publicity is also governed by statutes like the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The statement oversimplifies the legal basis for the right to publicity.  The Supreme Court's judgment in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) Case (2018) also plays a significant role.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC Chairperson and Members are appointed by the President of India based solely on the recommendations of the Prime Minister.
2. The NHRC can investigate any human rights violation complaint, irrespective of when the incident occurred.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister heads the committee that recommends appointments to the NHRC, the committee also includes the Speaker of Lok Sabha, the Home Minister, leaders of the opposition in both houses of Parliament, and the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha.  The President makes the final appointment based on this committee's recommendations. The process involves multiple stakeholders, not solely the Prime Minister's decision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, under which the NHRC operates, places a time limit on filing complaints.  The NHRC typically cannot investigate cases if the complaint is filed more than one year after the incident.  There are exceptions, but a one-year time limit is generally in place.  This restriction is designed to ensure timely investigation and prevent the commission from being bogged down by excessively old cases, potentially impacting its efficiency and focus on current human rights issues.


**2. With reference to the All India Judicial Services (AIJS), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIJS aims to decentralize the recruitment of judges at the district level, empowering individual states to manage their judicial appointments independently.
2.  The constitutional provision for AIJS was introduced through the 42nd Amendment but requires further legislative action to define its operational framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIJS aims to *centralize*, not decentralize, the recruitment process for judges at the additional district judge and district judge levels across all states. This is intended to create a more uniform and potentially more meritocratic system, rather than allowing each state to have its own potentially disparate approach.  Decentralization would imply greater state-level control, which is the opposite of the AIJS's goal.

Statement 2 is correct. The 42nd Amendment did add the provision for AIJS to Article 312 of the Constitution. However,  a separate bill is still required to establish the detailed structure, procedures, and operational aspects of the AIJS. The constitutional provision provides the legal basis, but the specifics of implementation remain to be legislated. This highlights the distinction between constitutional authorization and the practical implementation of a policy.


**3. With reference to the Mediation Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates mediation as the primary mode of dispute resolution for all civil and commercial disputes in India, overriding other methods like arbitration.
2.  The Mediation Council of India (MCI) is responsible for appointing mediators for all court-annexed mediation proceedings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mediation Act, 2023, promotes mediation as a *preferred* method of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), but it doesn't mandate it as the *primary* or *sole* method for all civil and commercial disputes.  Other ADR mechanisms, such as arbitration and conciliation, continue to exist and remain relevant options for dispute resolution. The Act aims to increase the use of mediation, but it doesn't supersede or replace other existing processes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the MCI plays a crucial role in regulating and overseeing mediation, it does not directly appoint mediators for all court-annexed mediation proceedings.  High Courts and Supreme Court have their own rules and processes for appointing mediators in court-annexed mediations. The MCI's role is more focused on establishing standards, accrediting mediation service providers, and fostering the overall development of the mediation framework.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Legal Services Authorities (LSA) Act, 1987:**

1. The Act establishes a three-tiered structure consisting of National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), State Legal Services Authorities (SALSAs), and District Legal Services Authorities (DLSA).
2. The Act primarily focuses on providing legal aid to individuals earning above a specified income threshold, ensuring access to justice for the affluent segment of society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The LSA Act, 1987, indeed establishes a three-tiered structure for legal aid delivery in India: NALSA at the national level, SALSAs at the state level, and DSLAs at the district level. This hierarchical structure ensures that legal aid services are accessible across the country, catering to diverse geographical locations and populations.  The structure is designed to facilitate efficient and coordinated delivery of services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The LSA Act, 1987, specifically aims to provide free and accessible legal aid to the *poor and marginalized sections of society*.  It's designed to bridge the gap in access to justice for those who cannot afford legal representation, focusing on ensuring equal opportunities for all before the law. The act's focus is on the underprivileged, not the affluent.


**5. With reference to the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, consider the following statements:**

1. A judge can be removed from office under this Act only if found guilty of both "proved misbehaviour" and "proved incapacity."
2. The inquiry committee under the Act comprises three members: two Supreme Court judges and one Chief Justice of a High Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, a judge can be removed for either "proved misbehaviour" *or* "proved incapacity." It doesn't require both conditions to be met simultaneously.  The act allows for removal based on either ground, reflecting the seriousness of either type of misconduct or deficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The inquiry committee under the Act consists of a Supreme Court judge, a Chief Justice of a High Court, and an eminent jurist. The composition includes a jurist from outside the judiciary, ensuring a broader perspective and expertise in the inquiry process. The inclusion of a jurist ensures that legal expertise is not limited to only the judicial system.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Rann of Kutch, consider the following statements:**

1. The primary reason for the formation of the White Desert in the Rann of Kutch is the deposition of gypsum from seawater evaporation.
2. The Asiatic Wild Ass, also known as the Khulan, is a keystone species within the Rann of Kutch ecosystem, playing a crucial role in seed dispersal.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the White Desert's formation is linked to salt accumulation after summer evaporation, the primary mineral deposited isn't gypsum but primarily salt (sodium chloride). Gypsum is present, but not the dominant factor in the White Desert's unique landscape.  The text highlights salt accumulation as the primary reason.  The process involves the evaporation of shallow saline water bodies, leaving behind the salt deposits, creating the characteristic white appearance.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Asiatic Wild Ass (Khulan) inhabits the Rann of Kutch and plays a significant role in the region's ecology.  While the text doesn't explicitly state seed dispersal, their grazing patterns and movements influence vegetation dynamics, thus making them a keystone species.  Their presence contributes to the overall health and balance of the Rann of Kutch ecosystem.  The absence or decline of this species would have significant repercussions.


**2. With reference to the Chilika Lake, consider the following statements:**

1. Chilika Lake is the world's largest brackish water lagoon and is located in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
2. Nalbana Bird Sanctuary, a crucial habitat for migratory birds, is situated within the core area of Chilika Lake.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Chilika Lake is indeed one of the world's largest brackish water lagoons, its location is in Odisha, not Andhra Pradesh. The text clearly states Odisha as its location.  The claim of being the "world's largest" can be debated depending on the definition of "lagoon", but the statement's inaccuracy regarding the state makes it incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Nalbana Bird Sanctuary is explicitly mentioned within the text as a significant component within the core area of Chilika Lake, serving as a crucial habitat for a wide array of migratory bird species.  Its importance as an IBA (Important Bird Area) further reinforces its significance within the Chilika Lake ecosystem.


**3. With reference to the Siang River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Siang River originates near Mount Everest and flows exclusively through the state of Arunachal Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Siang River's origin is near Mount Kailash in Tibet, not Mount Everest. The text explicitly mentions its origin in Tibet.  Furthermore, it doesn't flow exclusively through Arunachal Pradesh; it originates in Tibet and enters India through Arunachal Pradesh.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly identifies the Siang River's Tibetan name as Yarlung Tsangpo and its status as a major tributary of the Brahmaputra River. This is a well-established geographical fact.


**4. With reference to the Baltic Sea, consider the following statements:**

1. The Baltic Sea is the oldest sea on Earth and is connected to the city of Moscow via the Gulf of Finland.
2. The Baltic Sea is a large brackish water body characterized by low salinity and is bordered by several countries including Sweden and Finland.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Baltic Sea is not the oldest sea on Earth; this is a factual error.  The text states it is a relatively young sea. The connection to Moscow is also incorrect; it is connected to St. Petersburg, not Moscow, via the Gulf of Finland.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the Baltic Sea as a large brackish water body with low salinity.  It also correctly mentions Sweden and Finland as bordering countries, along with several others.


**5. With reference to the Panama Canal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, significantly reducing shipping times between North America and Europe.
2. The Panama Canal is located on the Isthmus of Panama and divides North and South America.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, not the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.  The text clearly states that it connects the Atlantic and Pacific.  The statement also oversimplifies the impact on shipping times; while it does reduce them, the statement is inaccurate in its specifics.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text correctly places the Panama Canal on the Isthmus of Panama and notes its role in dividing North and South America.


**6. With reference to Douala-Edea National Park, consider the following statements:**

1. Douala-Edea National Park, recently in the news, is located in the Caribbean Islands and is known for its diverse coral reefs.
2. The park is situated in the Central African Republic and is a significant habitat for several endangered primate species.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  Douala-Edea National Park is located in Cameroon, not the Caribbean Islands or the Central African Republic. The text specifies its location in Cameroon.  The descriptions of its features in both statements are also inaccurate; while the park has diverse flora and fauna, the specific details mentioned are not accurate representations of the park's prominent features.



**7. With reference to the Suez Canal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal officially opened to ships in 1869, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, thereby significantly impacting global trade routes.
2.  The Suez Canal is an artificial waterway that passes through the Sinai Peninsula, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Suez Canal's opening date is accurately stated as 1869, and its significant impact on global trade routes is a well-known fact. The text doesn't give the exact date of opening, but the fact is correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas, it does *not* pass through the Sinai Peninsula.  The canal's location is in Egypt, and the Sinai Peninsula is geographically separate.


**8. With reference to Pangong Tso, consider the following statements:**

1. Pangong Tso is a freshwater lake located entirely within the Indian territory of Ladakh.
2. The lake's varying shades of color are primarily due to the presence of different types of phytoplankton.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pangong Tso is not entirely within Indian territory; it is partially located in China.  The text mentions that both India and China claim parts of the lake.  It's also a saltwater lake, not freshwater.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions different algae, the primary reason for the color change is the varying depths of the lake and the reflection of the sky, not just different types of phytoplankton. The presence of minerals can also contribute to the color variations.  The statement oversimplifies a complex phenomenon.


**9. With reference to the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DRI is an anti-smuggling agency under the Ministry of Home Affairs, primarily focused on narcotics smuggling.
2. Recent smuggling methods identified by the DRI include concealing contraband within children's books and clothing items.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DRI is indeed an anti-smuggling agency, but it operates under the Ministry of Finance (Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs), not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Its mandate is broader than just narcotics, encompassing various forms of smuggling.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the DRI's identification of novel smuggling techniques, including the concealment of goods within children's books and clothing.


**10. With reference to La Niña, consider the following statements:**

1. La Niña is characterized by unusually warm ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, impacting global weather patterns.
2. La Niña events generally have a positive impact on the Indian monsoon, leading to increased rainfall.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. La Niña is characterized by *cooler*, not warmer, ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. The text clearly contrasts it with El Niño, which features warmer temperatures.

Statement 2 is correct. The text states that La Niña positively impacts the Indian monsoon, resulting in stronger trade winds and increased rainfall.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. La Niña events are characterized by stronger-than-usual trade winds, pushing warmer waters towards the Indonesian coast and leading to colder-than-normal conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
2.  A significant impact of La Niña on India is consistently reduced rainfall, resulting in weaker monsoon seasons and potential agricultural challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key characteristic of La Niña. The strengthened trade winds are a defining feature, leading to the displacement of warm water and the cooling of the eastern Pacific. This is a well-established aspect of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  La Niña typically leads to *increased*, not reduced, rainfall in India.  The stronger monsoon is a major consequence of the altered atmospheric circulation patterns associated with La Niña.  Reduced rainfall is more commonly linked to El Niño events. The statement misrepresents the impact of La Niña on the Indian monsoon system, a crucial element in understanding South Asian climate patterns.  Understanding the contrasting effects of El Niño and La Niña on the Indian monsoon is vital for agricultural planning and disaster preparedness.


**2. With reference to the geographical features of the Atlantic Ocean, consider the following statements:**

1. The Baltic Sea, a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean, is characterized by exceptionally high salinity levels comparable to the open waters of the Atlantic.
2. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a significant underwater mountain range, is located within the Atlantic Ocean and is a key feature of seafloor spreading.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Baltic Sea exhibits relatively *low* salinity compared to the open Atlantic Ocean. This is due to significant freshwater input from rivers and reduced mixing with the open ocean.  The statement wrongly attributes high salinity to the Baltic Sea, which is a crucial point for understanding its unique ecosystem.  The difference in salinity between the Baltic and the open Atlantic highlights the influence of regional factors on oceanographic properties.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Baltic Sea:**

1. The Baltic Sea's salinity is significantly higher than that of the Black Sea due to reduced river inflow and higher evaporation rates in the Baltic.
2. The Baltic Sea is characterized by a unique, counterclockwise circulation pattern driven primarily by the inflow of saline water from the North Sea.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Baltic Sea is actually one of the largest bodies of brackish water on Earth, characterized by low salinity compared to the Black Sea. This low salinity is a direct result of significant freshwater inflow from numerous rivers and relatively limited exchange with the higher-salinity waters of the North Sea.  The Black Sea, on the other hand, has a higher salinity due to less freshwater input and a restricted connection to the Mediterranean Sea.  Therefore, the claim about higher salinity in the Baltic is factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Baltic Sea does indeed possess a unique, counterclockwise circulation pattern. This is primarily driven by the inflow of more saline water from the North Sea through the narrow Danish Straits. This saline inflow creates a density gradient, influencing the water movement and creating the characteristic circulation.  The relatively shallow depth of the Baltic Sea also plays a role in this unique circulation pattern.  This aspect of the Baltic's hydrography is well-documented in oceanographic studies.


**2. With reference to the physical characteristics of the Baltic and Black Seas, consider the following statements:**

1. Both the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea are characterized by the presence of significant sills, which restrict water exchange with adjacent seas and influence their salinity profiles.
2. The Baltic Sea experiences the impact of temperate cyclones, while the Black Sea is primarily influenced by Mediterranean cyclones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Black Sea does indeed have a sill at the Bosporus Strait, which restricts the outflow of its less saline water and inflow of saline Mediterranean water, the Baltic Sea has a more complex sill system.  The sills in the Danish Straits are crucial in controlling the inflow of saline North Sea water into the Baltic. However, the statement incorrectly implies a similar degree and type of sill influence on both seas. The Baltic's sill system is more complex and its effects are more nuanced than the simpler sill at the Bosporus.

Statement 2 is correct. Temperate cyclones, originating from the Atlantic, frequently impact the Baltic Sea, affecting its weather patterns and water circulation.  The Black Sea, however, is primarily under the influence of Mediterranean cyclones, which have a different origin and characteristics. This difference in the meteorological phenomena affecting the two seas stems from their geographical locations and proximity to different weather systems.


**3. With reference to the geographical features of the Baltic Sea, consider the following statements:**

1.  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, collectively known as the Baltic States, are entirely landlocked and do not share any coastline with the Baltic Sea.
2. The Baltic Sea drains into the Atlantic Ocean via a series of interconnected waterways, including the Kattegat and the Skagerrak.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are coastal countries and share significant coastlines with the Baltic Sea. They are known as the Baltic States precisely because of their location on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.  The statement incorrectly presents them as landlocked, a significant geographical inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Baltic Sea is connected to the North Sea, and subsequently the Atlantic Ocean, through a series of straits and sounds. The Kattegat and Skagerrak are key waterways in this connection. The drainage pattern is not a direct, single river flow, but rather a complex system of interconnected water bodies that ultimately lead the Baltic's outflow to the Atlantic Ocean.  Understanding this hydrological connectivity is crucial for comprehending the Baltic's ecosystem and its interaction with the larger Atlantic system.


**4. With reference to the Panama Canal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panama Canal is a sea-level canal, without locks, allowing for continuous and efficient passage of ships.
2. Donald Trump's threat to reimpose U.S. control over the Panama Canal was primarily motivated by concerns over rising canal fees and the growing influence of China in nearby ports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Panama Canal is *not* a sea-level canal; it utilizes a system of locks to raise and lower ships between different water levels.  This lock system is essential because the canal crosses the continental divide of the Isthmus of Panama, requiring the ships to be elevated to higher elevations before descending to the other side.  The statement's assertion of a sea-level canal is a fundamental misunderstanding of the canal's engineering design.

Statement 2 is correct. Donald Trump's threat to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal, although ultimately unsuccessful, was indeed motivated by concerns about high fees charged by the Panamanian government and the increasing economic and geopolitical influence of China in ports near the canal.  This reflects a broader U.S. strategic concern regarding China's growing global presence and its potential impact on key infrastructure and trade routes.


**5. With reference to government schemes/initiatives in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan primarily focuses on providing financial assistance to individuals with disabilities for entrepreneurship.
2. The Anna Chakra platform is designed to enhance the nutritional quality of food grains distributed through the Public Distribution System (PDS) by promoting fortification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan (Accessible India Campaign) is a flagship initiative aimed at making public infrastructure, including buildings, transportation, and information and communication technology (ICT), accessible to persons with disabilities. While it indirectly contributes to employment opportunities, its primary focus is not on financial aid for business ventures. The statement misrepresents the core objective of the scheme by focusing on a secondary aspect.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Anna Chakra platform's primary objective is to optimize the supply chain for food grain distribution within the PDS. While improved distribution can indirectly contribute to better nutritional outcomes, the scheme itself does not directly focus on improving the nutritional quality through fortification.  The statement incorrectly attributes a function of food policy to a logistical platform.  Fortification is a separate policy initiative.


**6. With reference to the  'Bima Sakhi Yojana' of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme provides a monthly stipend to women aged between 18 and 70 years, regardless of their educational qualifications.
2. The ‘Bima Sakhi Yojana’ primarily aims to empower women by providing them with specialized training in insurance and financial literacy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the 'Bima Sakhi Yojana' targets women aged 18-70 years, it does require a minimum educational qualification of Class X pass. The statement incorrectly removes this eligibility criterion, making it a less precise description of the scheme's target beneficiaries.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary objective of the ‘Bima Sakhi Yojana’ is to empower women by equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to promote financial literacy and insurance awareness. The stipend provided is a tool to support their training and not the primary aim of the scheme. The statement accurately identifies the core purpose of this women’s empowerment initiative.


**7. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri – Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-ABHIM is solely a Central Sector Scheme, with no state-level components or funding contributions.
2. The mission primarily focuses on strengthening tertiary healthcare facilities, neglecting primary and secondary care levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-ABHIM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS), meaning it involves both central and state-level participation and funding. While the central government plays a significant role, states also contribute to its implementation and resource allocation. The statement incorrectly simplifies the funding structure, ignoring the important role of state governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PM-ABHIM is designed to strengthen health systems across all levels of care—primary, secondary, and tertiary. While tertiary care is a component, the mission recognizes the importance of a holistic approach to healthcare infrastructure development. The statement misrepresents the comprehensive nature of the mission by focusing on only one aspect of its multi-pronged strategy.


**8. With reference to the PM CARES Fund, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio chairman of the PM CARES Fund.
2.  Donations to the PM CARES Fund are eligible to be counted as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio chairman of the PM CARES Fund. This reflects the fund's position as a high-level initiative directly under the Prime Minister's oversight.  The statement accurately reflects the organizational structure of the fund.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Donations to the PM CARES Fund *do not* qualify as CSR expenditure. This was clarified by the government to ensure that CSR funds are directed towards other eligible activities. The statement presents an incorrect interpretation of CSR regulations related to charitable contributions.


**9. With reference to the Smart Cities Mission (SCM), consider the following statements:**

1. The Smart Cities Mission is implemented solely by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, without any involvement of state governments or local bodies.
2. The mission aims to improve the quality of life in selected cities through the use of technology and sustainable infrastructure, focusing solely on economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Smart Cities Mission involves significant participation from state governments and urban local bodies.  While the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs provides overall guidance and support, the actual implementation and execution of projects are largely decentralized and involve substantial state and local input. The statement incorrectly portrays a highly centralized implementation model.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Smart Cities Mission aims to improve the quality of life in participating cities, encompassing various aspects beyond just economic growth.  These include improved infrastructure, citizen services, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.  The statement oversimplifies the mission's wide-ranging goals by focusing solely on economic development.  The mission's success is assessed across multiple social and environmental indicators.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mission Karmayogi utilizes online platforms like iGOT Karmayogi for training, its scope extends beyond online modules. It encompasses a holistic approach to civil service training and capacity building, including on-site learning and a range of other methods.  The program aims to reform the entire civil service training ecosystem, not just limit itself to online training. The program also includes the development of new training policies, a competency framework, and institutional reforms.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core principle of Mission Karmayogi is its competency-driven approach.  This means that training is tailored to the specific roles and responsibilities of civil servants, ensuring that development aligns with the needs of their positions. This contrasts with older, more generalized training programs. The focus is on equipping civil servants with the skills and knowledge necessary for effective performance in their respective roles.  The program employs a role-based training methodology, emphasizing practical application over theoretical learning.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Amrit Gyaan Kosh Portal:**

1.  The portal exclusively curates best practices from within India, focusing solely on domestic administrative challenges.
2.  It is aligned with all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Amrit Gyaan Kosh Portal does indeed curate best practices from across India, addressing India's unique administrative challenges, it is not exclusive to domestic practices.  The portal aims to align training with global standards, implying a consideration of international best practices as well. The goal is to learn from both domestic and international successes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The portal aligns with 15 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The statement incorrectly claims alignment with all 17 goals. This discrepancy highlights the need for precise factual recall in understanding government initiatives.  The specific 15 SDGs covered reflect the priorities of the Indian government in its capacity-building efforts.


**3. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The SDGs were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2016 and are intended to be achieved by 2025.
2.  The SDGs replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established in 2000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SDGs were indeed adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, but the year was 2015, not 2016.  The target year for achievement is 2030, not 2025.  This demonstrates the importance of precise recall of dates and timelines when dealing with international development goals.

Statement 2 is correct. The SDGs directly succeeded the MDGs.  The MDGs, established in 2000, focused on a set of eight goals to be achieved by 2015. The SDGs expanded upon and built on the MDGs, setting a more comprehensive and ambitious agenda for global development.  The shift from MDGs to SDGs represents a significant evolution in the approach to international development cooperation.


**4. With reference to the SVAMITVA scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme primarily aims to digitize land records in urban areas, improving property tax collection efficiency.
2.  The distribution of property cards under the scheme commenced in 2020.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SVAMITVA scheme focuses on rural areas, not urban areas. Its primary objective is to provide property rights to villagers in rural inhabited areas (Abadis) through the creation of accurate land records.  The improvement of property tax collection is a secondary benefit, and the focus remains on rural land ownership.

Statement 2 is correct. The distribution of property cards under the SVAMITVA scheme began in October 2020, following the scheme's launch in April 2020. This timeline is crucial in understanding the scheme's implementation progress.  The scheme uses drone surveys and other technologies to create accurate land records.


**5.  With reference to the PM-ABHIM (Pradhan Mantri-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission), consider the following statements:**

1. The Mission is solely a Central Sector Scheme (CS) with no Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) components.
2.  It was launched with an outlay of ₹64,180 crore over a period of five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-ABHIM includes both Central Sector Scheme (CS) and Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) components.  This distinction is important for understanding the funding and implementation mechanisms of the scheme.  The division of responsibility between the central and state governments is a key feature of the mission’s structure.

Statement 2 is correct.  PM-ABHIM was indeed launched with an outlay of ₹64,180 crore, spanning five years from 2021-2026. The large financial commitment reflects the government’s dedication to strengthening public health infrastructure.  The significant funding emphasizes the scale and ambition of the mission.


**6. Consider the following statements about the PM CARES Fund:**

1. The PM CARES Fund operates under the direct financial control of the Government of India and is part of the annual budget.
2. Donations to the PM CARES Fund qualify for 80G tax benefits under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM CARES Fund is a public charitable trust, separate from the government budget and operates independently of direct government financial control. This independent nature is a key characteristic of the fund.  Its operations are distinct from the government's regular financial processes.

Statement 2 is correct. Donations to the PM CARES Fund are eligible for 100% exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This tax benefit encourages charitable donations to the fund.  The tax incentive is designed to attract private contributions for disaster relief and emergency situations.  Additionally, donations are also counted as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) expenditure.


**7. With reference to the Smart Cities Mission (SCM), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCM was initially scheduled for completion by 2020 and covers 200 cities across India.
2.  The four pillars of the SCM are Social Infrastructure, Physical Infrastructure, Institutional Infrastructure, and Economic Infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Smart Cities Mission (SCM) initially aimed for completion by 2019-20, not 2020, and it covers 100 cities, not 200.  The initial timeline and the number of cities included are key facts to remember about the scheme. The mission has since been extended.

Statement 2 is correct. The four pillars of the SCM accurately reflect the mission's multi-faceted approach to urban development.  These pillars comprehensively address various aspects of urban infrastructure and governance.  Understanding these pillars is essential for a complete grasp of the mission's objectives.  The integrated approach is a defining characteristic of the SCM.

**1. With reference to the Border Security Force (BSF), consider the following statements:**

1. The BSF's primary mandate includes guarding India's borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, conducting anti-Naxal operations, and participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.  Its officers are exclusively drawn from the Indian Police Service (IPS).

2.  Established in 1965, the BSF operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and has a sanctioned strength exceeding 10 lakh personnel.  A significant portion of its operational deployments involve counter-insurgency operations in Naxal-affected regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the BSF does guard India's borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh and conducts anti-Naxal operations, its participation in UN peacekeeping missions is not a primary or consistent role.  Furthermore, although the Director-General (DG) of the BSF has historically been an IPS officer, the force itself has its own cadre of officers.  The statement incorrectly presents the IPS as the *exclusive* source of BSF officers.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The BSF was indeed established in 1965 and falls under the MHA. However, the claim of a sanctioned strength exceeding 10 lakh personnel is an exaggeration; while the total sanctioned strength of all CAPFs is around 11 lakh, the BSF's sanctioned strength is a significant but smaller portion of this total.  The emphasis on counter-insurgency operations in Naxal-affected areas, while a notable part of its responsibilities,  overstates its deployment compared to its border security role.  The BSF has multiple responsibilities beyond counter-insurgency.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's military exercises:**

1. Exercise CINBAX, a joint counter-terrorism exercise between the Indian Army and the Cambodian Army, focuses exclusively on jungle warfare tactics and casualty management, simulating operations under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.

2. Exercise HARIMAU SHAKTI, an annual joint military exercise between India and Malaysia, is conducted exclusively in jungle terrain and involves counter-insurgency operations under Chapter VII of the UN mandate.  The exercise alternates between India and Malaysia annually.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Exercise CINBAX is indeed a joint counter-terrorism exercise between India and Cambodia under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, its scope extends beyond jungle warfare tactics and casualty management.  It also includes discussions on information operations, cyber warfare, hybrid warfare, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations.  The statement's focus on a limited scope misrepresents the exercise's broader objectives.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. Exercise HARIMAU SHAKTI is indeed an annual joint military exercise between India and Malaysia focusing on counter-insurgency operations under the UN mandate and does alternate annually between the two countries. However, while the jungle environment is a significant aspect, it does not exclusively take place in jungle terrain. The statement's overly specific focus on location misrepresents the exercise's diverse operational contexts.



**3. With reference to India's naval exercises and operations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Exercise SLINEX, a bilateral naval exercise between India and Sri Lanka, primarily focuses on anti-submarine warfare and has been conducted annually since its inception in 2005, alternating between Colombo and Visakhapatnam.

2.  The Indian Navy's commissioning of the survey ship Nirdeshak, built at GRSE Kolkata, expands its hydrographic survey capabilities and supports maritime operations.  The ship also enhances the Navy's ability to conduct anti-piracy operations in the Arabian Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Exercise SLINEX is a bilateral naval exercise between India and Sri Lanka aimed at enhancing interoperability and exchanging best practices in multifaceted maritime operations. While it has been conducted since 2005, it's not annual, and it doesn't primarily focus on anti-submarine warfare. The statement's emphasis on a specific aspect and incorrect frequency makes it inaccurate.  The location of the exercise also alternates.

Statement 2 is correct. The commissioning of INS Nirdeshak significantly enhances the Indian Navy's hydrographic survey capabilities, directly supporting maritime operations and navigation. While anti-piracy operations are a part of the Navy's overall mandate, the Nirdeshak's primary role is not directly focused on this.  The statement accurately reflects the ship's core function within the broader context of naval operations.



**4. With reference to India's defense collaborations and exercises, consider the following statements:**

1.  India and Saudi Arabia's defense cooperation includes joint ventures, industrial collaborations, and joint military exercises such as Sada Tanseeq (an army exercise) and Tarang Shakti (a naval exercise), focusing on counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations.

2.  Exercise Surya Kiran, an annual joint military exercise between India and Nepal, focuses primarily on counter-terrorism operations in mountainous terrain and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) under the UN Charter. The exercise is held alternately in India and Nepal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While India and Saudi Arabia do have enhanced defense cooperation, including joint ventures and industrial collaboration (such as the procurement of ATAGS), and joint exercises like Sada Tanseeq, the description is inaccurate. Tarang Shakti is an air exercise, not a naval exercise, in which Saudi Arabia participated as an observer.  The statement incorrectly categorizes the exercises and omits the naval exercise Al Mohed Al Hindi.

Statement 2 is correct. Exercise Surya Kiran is an annual joint military exercise between India and Nepal, focusing on enhancing interoperability in jungle warfare, counter-terrorism operations, and HADR operations under the UN Charter.  The location alternates between India and Nepal, as stated.  The statement accurately describes the exercise's primary focus and operational context.


**5. With reference to the Indo-Pakistan Wars, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 commenced with pre-emptive airstrikes by Pakistan on December 3, 1971, targeting 11 Indian airbases. The war resulted in the liberation of East Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh on December 16, 1971, at the Ramna Race Course in Dhaka.

2. Operation Vijay, the codename for India's military action to liberate Goa from Portuguese rule, commenced on December 17, 1961, and concluded with the surrender of the Portuguese Governor-General on December 19, 1961, marking Goa Liberation Day.  Vijay Diwas commemorates the victory in the 1971 war.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 did begin with Pakistan's pre-emptive airstrikes on December 3, 1971, targeting 11 Indian airbases. The war's conclusion and the surrender of Pakistani forces in Dhaka on December 16, 1971, led to the liberation of East Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. The statement is accurate in its depiction of the major events.

Statement 2 is correct. Operation Vijay was indeed the codename for India's military operation to liberate Goa, beginning on December 17, 1961, and resulting in the surrender of the Portuguese Governor-General on December 19, 1961.  Goa Liberation Day commemorates this event. Vijay Diwas, however, commemorates the victory in the 1971 war, not Operation Vijay.  The statement is mostly accurate, with a minor error in the commemoration detail.


**6.  With reference to  INS Tushil and related naval projects, consider the following statements:**

1. INS Tushil, constructed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad, Russia, is an upgraded Krivak III class frigate under Project 1135.6 and incorporates approximately 74% Indian-made components, highlighting strong Indo-Russian military-technical cooperation.

2.  Project 75 (India), also known as P-75(I), aims to construct six diesel-electric submarines for the Indian Navy, with INS Tushil representing a significant advancement in this program by incorporating advanced stealth technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While INS Tushil was indeed constructed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad, Russia, and is an upgraded Krivak III class frigate under Project 1135.6, the percentage of Indian-made components is significantly lower than 74%; it's around 26%. The statement misrepresents the extent of Indian contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Project 75 (India) or P-75(I) does aim to build six diesel-electric submarines for the Indian Navy. However, INS Tushil is a frigate, not a submarine, and therefore has no direct connection to this project. The statement wrongly links INS Tushil to Project 75(I) and incorrectly attributes advanced stealth technology to it.


**7. Consider the following statements about India's participation in multinational military exercises:**

1.  Exercise Desert Knight, a trilateral defense exercise involving India, France, and the UAE, was conducted in the Arabian Sea, focusing primarily on enhancing interoperability in air combat skills and countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

2.  Exercise Malabar, a joint naval exercise involving India, the USA, Japan, and Australia, is held annually in the Indian Ocean and focuses on enhancing interoperability in anti-submarine warfare, maritime domain awareness, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Exercise Desert Knight is a trilateral defense exercise involving India, France, and the UAE, conducted in the Arabian Sea.  It aims to strengthen trilateral defense cooperation and enhance combat skills and interoperability among the three nations’ air forces.  Countering China's influence is a significant, albeit not the *primary*, factor given the exercise's location and the participating nations' strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Exercise Malabar is a joint naval exercise involving India, the USA, Japan, and Australia.  While it does enhance interoperability, its focus is broader than the statement suggests.  It is not held annually; while it has become increasingly frequent, it's not an annual event. The statement simplifies the exercise's objectives and incorrectly claims annual occurrence.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was established in 1960 with the primary goal of stabilizing oil prices through production quotas.  Its initial members included Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.
2. The International Energy Agency (IEA) primarily focuses on energy security and policy coordination among its member countries,  all of which are also members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. OPEC was indeed founded in 1960 with the aim of stabilizing oil prices, initially by five founding members and later expanding. The listed initial members are accurate. However, the statement oversimplifies OPEC's complex history and goals, which have evolved considerably over time to include broader aspects of energy market management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the IEA does focus on energy security and policy,  it's inaccurate to state that *all* its members are also OECD members.  While OECD membership is a prerequisite for full membership in the IEA, associate members exist, and the IEA also collaborates with non-member countries on various initiatives.  The IEA’s mandate is broader than simply OECD-member coordination, encompassing global energy issues and international cooperation.  Therefore, the statement presents an overly restrictive view of the IEA's membership and activities.


**2. With reference to the International Energy Agency (IEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IEA's World Energy Outlook report, published annually, provides comprehensive forecasts and analyses of global energy markets, including detailed projections for energy demand, supply, and prices in various regions, and technological advancements.
2. The IEA's activities are solely confined to the analysis and forecasting of energy trends; it does not engage in policy recommendations or international cooperation on energy-related matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IEA's World Energy Outlook is a highly influential publication providing detailed analysis and projections on global energy markets. It covers diverse aspects like energy demand, supply, prices, technological change, and their regional implications, making it a key resource for policymakers and analysts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IEA's role extends far beyond mere analysis and forecasting.  It actively engages in policy dialogues, provides recommendations to governments, and fosters international cooperation on various energy-related issues, including energy security, climate change mitigation, and the transition to cleaner energy sources. The IEA's influence on global energy policy is significant due to its active engagement in shaping and coordinating international efforts.


**3. With reference to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), consider the following statements:**

1.  The OECD, headquartered in Paris,  is a global organization comprising 38 member countries, primarily focused on economic growth and development, including policy research and recommendations in various economic sectors such as energy, trade, and environmental policy. India is a full member of the OECD.
2. Membership in the OECD is a prerequisite for full membership in the International Energy Agency (IEA),  reflecting the close link between energy security and broader economic development strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the OECD's description is largely accurate regarding its focus and membership (38 member countries), the assertion that India is a *full* member is false. India holds an "ad hoc" participant status in certain OECD bodies, allowing for participation in specific areas, but it does not have full membership.

Statement 2 is correct.  Full membership in the IEA requires membership in the OECD, highlighting the interconnectedness of energy policies with broader economic strategies.

2. India's engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is primarily focused on security cooperation, with less emphasis on economic partnerships or trade agreements.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's "Neighbourhood First" policy does prioritize its neighbors, the emphasis is on a *non-reciprocal* approach, meaning India provides significant assistance and engagement without always expecting equal returns from its neighbors.  The statement incorrectly describes the policy as focusing on "reciprocal agreements".

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ASEAN engagement is robust and involves both security and economic dimensions.  There are significant economic partnerships, including the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), and extensive trade relations.  The statement misrepresents the scope of this engagement by underplaying the economic aspects.


**5. With reference to India's energy policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's energy consumption is dominated by renewable energy sources, reflecting a strong commitment to reducing reliance on fossil fuels and transitioning towards a cleaner energy future. Coal plays a minor role in India's energy mix.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is *not* a member of NATO.  India maintains a non-aligned foreign policy and avoids formal membership in military alliances.  The statement incorrectly asserts India's NATO membership.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Quad focuses on maritime security in the Indo-Pacific, aiming to promote freedom of navigation and address shared security concerns. However, the Quad's scope extends beyond strictly maritime issues to encompass broader strategic cooperation, including technological collaboration and economic engagement.  The statement oversimplifies the Quad's multifaceted approach.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  India is a signatory to the CBD and participates in COPs.  However, the claim that India has "consistently met all its commitments" is an overstatement. While India actively participates in international discussions and has made efforts towards biodiversity conservation,  fulfilling all commitments under such a complex and wide-ranging treaty is a continuous process with varying levels of success.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India has *not* ratified the Kyoto Protocol, primarily due to concerns regarding the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) and the historical responsibility of developed nations for greenhouse gas emissions.  India's approach to climate change mitigation is based on its own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is a significant trading partner of the EU, it's inaccurate to say India *consistently* maintains a trade surplus.  The trade balance between India and the EU fluctuates depending on various economic factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India has expressed *concerns* about the CBAM, arguing that it could disproportionately affect developing countries and create trade barriers.  India advocates for a more equitable approach to global climate action, emphasizing the historical responsibility of developed nations for greenhouse gas emissions.  Therefore, India does not support the CBAM in its current form.

2.  The Bangkok Declaration, which established BIMSTEC, prioritized transport connectivity as a crucial area of cooperation, alongside trade and economic development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the BIMSTEC Charter does define the organization and its principles, including sovereign equality, it wasn't adopted at the 5th summit in Sri Lanka. The 5th summit location is a separate fact.  The Charter's adoption date is also a separate detail, not directly related to the principle of sovereign equality.  The question plays on the interrelation of seemingly linked facts to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Bangkok Declaration, the founding document of BIMSTEC, focused on promoting economic cooperation, trade, and development in the Bay of Bengal region.  While the text mentions other focus areas like transport connectivity, environment, and climate change,  the primary focus outlined in the founding declaration was economic cooperation, making the transport connectivity aspect a potentially misleading detail. The order of importance of these focus areas also provides a distractor.

The question attempts to overemphasize a secondary objective to create a distractor.


**3. With reference to India's engagement with BIMSTEC, consider the following statements:**

1.  The signing of several Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) by India within the BIMSTEC framework demonstrates a commitment to multilateral cooperation, exceeding the scope of bilateral relations.
2.  India's support for BIMSTEC is primarily channeled through financial aid and technical assistance, with limited involvement in joint initiatives or collaborative projects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mitochondria are essential organelles within eukaryotic cells, playing a critical role in cellular respiration, the process of converting nutrients into energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).  Mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting from age-related mutations or other factors, is implicated in various age-related diseases and the overall ageing process. Statement 2 is incorrect. While mtDNA is inherited maternally, it only encodes a small subset of the proteins needed for mitochondrial function.  The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and subsequently transported to the mitochondria.  The maternal inheritance of mtDNA is a significant aspect of genetics, but the statement's claim about the proportion of proteins encoded by mtDNA is inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**10. With reference to Poliovirus, consider the following statements:**

1.  Poliovirus Type 2 and Type 3 have been eradicated globally, with only Type 1 remaining endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
2.  The detection of poliovirus in wastewater systems in countries like Finland, Germany, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom indicates ongoing transmission and necessitates intensified surveillance efforts.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect in several aspects. The Sea Otter is the *smallest*, not the largest, marine mammal, and while it's a member of the weasel family, it's not the smallest. Its IUCN status is Least Concern, not Near Threatened. The question mixes up size and IUCN status effectively creating a distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the description of disasters of severe nature is accurate, the CRF sharing ratio is misrepresented.  The text indicates a 3:1 ratio (Centre:State), not an equal 1:1 ratio. The question manipulates the numerical ratio to create confusion.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri range, experiences a pronounced rain-shadow effect in Telangana, resulting in significantly less rainfall compared to the windward slopes.
2. The Western Ghats' steep gradient contributes to rapid river flow, leading to the formation of numerous waterfalls and gorges, particularly in Karnataka and Kerala.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Western Ghats do create a rain-shadow effect, its impact is most significantly felt in the eastern regions of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, not Telangana.  Telangana's rainfall patterns are influenced by other geographical factors and monsoonal systems.  The rain shadow effect primarily reduces rainfall on the leeward side of the mountain range, leading to drier conditions in the regions east of the Western Ghats.

Statement 2 is correct. The Western Ghats' characteristically steep slopes are responsible for the rapid flow of numerous rivers originating from its slopes. This rapid flow, coupled with the mountainous terrain, contributes significantly to the formation of numerous waterfalls and gorges in regions like Karnataka and Kerala, where the Western Ghats are most prominent.  The steep gradient increases the velocity of the water, leading to erosional processes that carve out these geological features.


**2. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) report primarily focused on the conservation of the Nilgiri Tahr, a highly endangered species endemic to the region, recommending specific measures for its protection.
2.  The Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage site, are characterized by high rainfall on the western side due to the orographic effect, with the leeward side experiencing a significant rain-shadow effect.

While the WGEEP report addressed broader ecological concerns of the Western Ghats,  it did indeed pay significant attention to the Nilgiri Tahr, given its endemic status and vulnerability. The report outlined several recommendations concerning the conservation and protection of this species alongside other elements of the region's rich biodiversity.  The report's recommendations were crucial for shaping conservation strategies in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Western Ghats' location and orientation relative to the prevailing monsoon winds lead to a significant orographic effect.  The western slopes receive abundant rainfall, while the eastern slopes are in the rain shadow, resulting in lower precipitation. This characteristic rainfall pattern is a crucial factor shaping the unique biodiversity and ecological systems of the Western Ghats region.  The UNESCO World Heritage status reflects the recognition of this unique ecological significance.


**3. With reference to the geographical features of Peninsular India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Palghat Gap, a significant break in the Western Ghats, facilitates east-west connectivity across the mountain range, impacting the region's rainfall patterns and biodiversity.
2. The convergence of the Western and Eastern Ghats creates a unique geological formation that influences the flow of major rivers in southern India, including the Cauvery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Palghat Gap, a natural break in the Western Ghats, acts as a significant passageway.  This gap facilitates connectivity between the eastern and western coastal plains of Peninsular India. Its presence also influences regional climate, allowing for the movement of moisture-laden winds and impacting rainfall patterns. This has a direct effect on the biodiversity of the region. The gap also creates a unique ecological transition zone.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Western and Eastern Ghats do not actually converge.  They are distinct mountain ranges running parallel to each other.  While their presence influences the overall drainage pattern of Peninsular India, the formation of river valleys and their flows are primarily determined by other factors such as geological structures, tectonic activity, and the gradients of the land. The Cauvery River's flow, for example, is largely shaped by the Western Ghats alone.



**4. With reference to the biodiversity of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats support a wide variety of forest types, including sub-tropical moist pine forests, but lack tropical dry deciduous forests due to high annual rainfall across the region.
2.  The Western Ghats are one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, sharing this distinction with Sri Lanka, and are characterized by a high level of species endemism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats display remarkable ecological diversity, supporting various forest types adapted to different altitudes and rainfall patterns.  Subtropical moist pine forests are found in certain areas.  The consistent and significant rainfall across much of the Western Ghats prevents the establishment of tropical dry deciduous forests, which require a distinct dry season. The high rainfall supports evergreen and moist deciduous vegetation types.

Statement 2 is correct. The Western Ghats are indeed a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot, sharing this status with Sri Lanka.  The high level of species endemism, meaning that many species are found only in this region, highlights the unique and irreplaceable nature of its biodiversity.  The high levels of endemism are a result of geographic isolation and a long evolutionary history. The region's unique biodiversity is a result of a combination of factors.


**5. With reference to the  management and conservation of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

2. The Kasturirangan Committee report provided comprehensive recommendations for the conservation of the Western Ghats, including the delineation of ecologically sensitive zones (ESZs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MoEFCC has not declared the *entire* Western Ghats region as an ESA.  Instead, specific areas within the Western Ghats have been designated as ESZs based on ecological sensitivity and the recommendations of various committees like the Kasturirangan Committee.  The approach has been to identify and protect particularly vulnerable areas rather than imposing blanket restrictions across the whole range.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kasturirangan Committee report offered a thorough assessment of the ecological sensitivity of the Western Ghats and proposed a comprehensive framework for its conservation.  A significant part of the report involved delineating ecologically sensitive zones (ESZs) to balance the needs of conservation with sustainable development. The recommendations, however, have faced controversies and debates.


**6. With reference to the  Indian Star Tortoise ( *Geochelone elegans*), consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Star Tortoise is listed in Appendix II of CITES, indicating that international trade is permitted with certain restrictions.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** World War II profoundly weakened Britain's global power and its ability to maintain its vast empire.  The economic strain, loss of manpower, and the rise of nationalist movements across its colonies created an unsustainable situation for continued colonial rule. This significantly contributed to India's independence. Statement 1 accurately reflects this causal link. Statement 2 is incorrect; the war did *not* lead to a substantial increase in the political influence of Indian princely states. While some individual rulers attempted to leverage the situation, the overall power dynamics within the British Indian system remained largely unchanged in the immediate aftermath of the war. The integration of princely states post-independence was a separate process.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**6. With reference to the  India State of Forest Report (ISFR), consider the following statements:**

1. The ISFR is published annually by the Forest Survey of India (FSI).
2. The ISFR provides data on forest cover, tree cover, and mangrove cover, but not on carbon stock.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The ISFR is a crucial report on India's forest resources.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it's published biennially (every two years), not annually, by the FSI. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the ISFR comprehensively covers forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, and crucially,  carbon stock estimations.  Therefore, both statements are factually incorrect.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is primarily administered by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** CITES is a crucial international agreement for wildlife conservation. Statement 1 is incorrect;  CITES is primarily administered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), not WWF.  WWF is a significant conservation organization that collaborates with CITES, but it doesn't administer it. Statement 2 is correct; India's Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, has been amended to incorporate species listed under CITES, demonstrating alignment with international conservation efforts.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8. With reference to the IUCN Red List, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IUCN Red List categorizes species based solely on population size reduction.
2. The IUCN Red List provides information on the conservation status of species, including their geographical range and habitat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The IUCN Red List is a critical tool for biodiversity conservation. Statement 1 is incorrect; while population size reduction is a key criterion, the IUCN Red List uses multiple criteria to assess a species' extinction risk. These include population size reduction, restricted geographical range, small population size and decline, very small or restricted range, and quantitative analysis of extinction risk.  Statement 2 is correct; the Red List provides comprehensive information on a species' conservation status, encompassing its geographical range, habitat, ecology, threats, and conservation actions.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The IUCN is a globally influential organization in conservation. Statement 1 is incorrect; the IUCN was founded in 1948, not 1961. Statement 2 is also incorrect;  IUCN's membership is a diverse mix of both government and civil society organizations, reflecting a collaborative approach to conservation challenges.  Therefore, both statements are false.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) publishes the Global Report on Food Crisis annually, highlighting the severity of food insecurity worldwide.
2. The FAO's Food Loss Index (FLI) measures the percentage of food lost during post-harvest handling and processing stages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FAO does publish extensively on food crises,  it's the Global Report on Food Crisis, a joint product of various UN agencies and other organizations, not solely an FAO publication.  The report is not published annually; the frequency varies. The report focuses on food insecurity but does not solely measure post harvest losses. Statement 2 is correct.  The FAO is indeed the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), which specifically quantifies food losses during post-harvest stages.  The FLI is a crucial metric for understanding and addressing food waste throughout the supply chain, a significant issue impacting food security and resource efficiency.  Option (b) is the only correct choice because it accurately reflects the FAO's role in relation to the FLI.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding the annual publication and the scope of the Global Report on Food Crisis.


**2. With reference to the Indian Budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission, responsible for recommending the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States, submits its report directly to the President of India.
2. The Ministry of Finance prepares the Union Budget, which includes details of government expenditure and revenue projections for the fiscal year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission, while crucial for fiscal federalism, submits its report to the President, who then tables it in Parliament.  The statement mistakenly claims direct submission to the President without mentioning the crucial parliamentary step.  Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Finance is the nodal ministry responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to the Parliament.  This budget outlines the government's fiscal strategy, including planned expenditure on various schemes and projected revenue collection.  The budget process is a key aspect of India's fiscal policy, influencing economic growth and social welfare programs.  Option (b) is thus the correct answer as it correctly identifies the Ministry of Finance's role in budget preparation. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the flawed description of the Finance Commission's reporting process in statement 1.


**3. With reference to the Ministry of Finance, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) are both independent statutory bodies reporting directly to the Prime Minister.
2. The Insurance Division, responsible for regulating the insurance sector, functions under the Department of Economic Affairs within the Ministry of Finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CBDT and CBIC are indeed under the Ministry of Finance, but they are not independent bodies reporting to the Prime Minister. They function under the overall control of the Ministry of Finance.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Insurance Division is indeed part of the Ministry of Finance, but it does not fall under the Department of Economic Affairs. It functions as a separate division within the Ministry.  Therefore, both statements present inaccurate information regarding the organizational structure and reporting lines within the Ministry of Finance. The correct option is (d), indicating that neither statement is accurate. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain factual errors about the organizational structure of the Ministry of Finance.


**4. With reference to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), consider the following statements:**

1.  ISRO's PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) is primarily used for launching heavier communication satellites into geostationary orbits.
2.  The development of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) aims to provide a cost-effective and reliable launch capability for smaller satellites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PSLV is indeed a significant launch vehicle for ISRO, but it's primarily designed for launching smaller satellites into sun-synchronous polar orbits, not heavier communication satellites into geostationary orbits.  That role is typically filled by ISRO's GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle). Statement 2 is correct.  The SSLV is a new generation launch vehicle developed by ISRO with the specific goal of providing a low-cost and reliable launch solution for smaller satellites. This aligns with the global trend towards miniaturization and increased demand for small satellite launches for various applications, including Earth observation, communication, and scientific research.  Option (b) is therefore the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the purpose of the SSLV. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary function of the PSLV.

1. The Pakri-Barwadih coal mine, one of India's largest, is located in Jharkhand and is known for its high-quality coking coal reserves.
2.  Jharkhand's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, with a significant percentage of its workforce employed in the primary sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Pakri-Barwadih is indeed a significant coal mine in Jharkhand, known for its substantial coking coal reserves, a crucial resource for the steel industry.  Jharkhand's mineral wealth, including coal, bauxite, and iron ore, plays a substantial role in its economy.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While agriculture is a part of Jharkhand's economy, it's not the dominant sector.  Jharkhand's economy is much more heavily driven by its mineral resources and associated industries.  A large portion of the workforce is engaged in mining, manufacturing, and related activities. Option (a) is, therefore, the correct answer because it accurately identifies the location of the Pakri-Barwadih coal mine. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the economic structure of Jharkhand, overemphasizing agriculture's role.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, is a legally binding international treaty outlining fundamental human rights.
2. The Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India case dealt with the issue of internet shutdowns in Jammu and Kashmir, examining their constitutionality under the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UDHR, while a landmark document setting forth fundamental human rights, is *not* a legally binding treaty. It serves as a foundational declaration influencing international human rights law but lacks the legal enforceability of a treaty. Statement 2 is correct. The Anuradha Bhasin case, a significant legal challenge in India, specifically addressed the legality and proportionality of internet shutdowns, particularly in the context of restrictions imposed in Jammu and Kashmir. The Supreme Court's ruling has implications for freedom of speech and expression in the digital age. Option (b) is therefore the correct answer, accurately describing the subject matter of the Anuradha Bhasin case. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 incorrectly characterizes the UDHR as a legally binding treaty.



**7. With reference to the World Malaria Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Malaria Report, released annually by the World Health Organization (WHO), provides a global overview of malaria trends, including incidence rates, mortality data, and control efforts.
2.  In 2023, India accounted for the highest number of malaria cases in the WHO South-East Asia Region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The WHO's World Malaria Report is an authoritative source of information on the global malaria situation, providing comprehensive data and analysis on disease burden, control strategies, and resource allocation.  It is published annually, offering valuable insights for public health planning and intervention. Statement 2 is incorrect. While India does have a significant malaria burden, it may not consistently hold the highest number of cases within the WHO South-East Asia Region every year.  Other countries in the region, such as Indonesia, may experience fluctuations in malaria incidence, sometimes exceeding India's numbers.  Option (a) is therefore correct as it correctly identifies the WHO as the publisher of the World Malaria Report.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the fluctuating nature of malaria incidence in the WHO South-East Asia Region.


**8. With reference to indigenous projects in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The ‘Bhavani’ project focuses on developing advanced submarine technology, including autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), for use by the Indian Navy.
2.  The Sreedharan Committee's recommendations are primarily focused on reforming India’s railway system, addressing issues such as infrastructure development, safety, and efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is actively developing indigenous submarine technology, ‘Bhavani’ is not necessarily focused on this specific area. The name 'Bhavani' might be associated with a different indigenous project, perhaps in a different sector like nuclear energy or defence systems. Statement 2 is correct.  The Sreedharan Committee, often in the news, has indeed submitted recommendations relating to significant reforms in the Indian Railways.  These recommendations cover various aspects, including infrastructure upgrades, safety improvements, operational efficiency, and financial management, aiming to modernize and enhance the railway network's performance. Option (b) is, therefore, the correct answer, accurately describing the focus of the Sreedharan Committee. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification or mischaracterization of the ‘Bhavani’ project in statement 1.


**9. With reference to international reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The Social Dialogue Report, focusing on the role of social dialogue in promoting decent work and sustainable development, is published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).
2.  The Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, providing data and analysis on human trafficking trends worldwide, is released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ILO is indeed the primary agency responsible for publishing the Social Dialogue Report, highlighting the crucial role of social dialogue—negotiations between governments, employers, and workers—in achieving decent work, social justice, and sustainable development.  The report analyzes trends, challenges, and best practices related to social dialogue mechanisms in different countries. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UNHCR focuses primarily on refugee protection and assistance. The Global Report on Trafficking in Persons is actually published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which addresses transnational organized crime, including human trafficking.  Option (a) is therefore the correct answer, accurately identifying the ILO's role in publishing the Social Dialogue Report.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misattribution of the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons to the UNHCR in statement 2.

1. The “Crossroads of Peace” initiative primarily aims to improve connectivity between Armenia and its neighboring countries, focusing on infrastructure development and regional cooperation.
2.  The Cape Town Declaration (2002) and Magna Carta London (2020) are primarily concerned with promoting sustainable tourism practices, aiming to balance economic development with environmental protection and social equity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The “Crossroads of Peace” initiative is indeed focused on enhancing connectivity between Armenia and its neighbors, aiming to foster regional cooperation through infrastructure development. This initiative addresses transportation, energy, and communication links, promoting economic integration and reducing regional tensions.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Cape Town Declaration and Magna Carta London are related to tourism, their primary focus is not on sustainable tourism. The Cape Town Declaration focused on the role of tourism in conservation, and the Magna Carta London is more about the ethical practices in the tourism industry.  Option (a) is therefore the correct answer, accurately describing the "Crossroads of Peace" initiative.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 2 misrepresents the content of the Cape Town Declaration and Magna Carta London.


**11. Consider the following statements:**

1. India’s first biobank for diabetes has been established in Chennai, focusing on storing and managing biological samples for diabetes research.
2. Varmam therapy, a traditional healing modality, is primarily associated with the Ayurvedic system of medicine, focusing on treating various ailments through herbal remedies and massage techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the exact name and focus might require further verification, the establishment of a committee or panel to review and suggest reforms in India's competitive examination system is a relevant development.  Such reforms aim to enhance the fairness and transparency of these crucial examinations which determine the entry into Civil services and other crucial positions. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Sahitya Akademi Awards, while prestigious, are awarded for literary merit in 24 languages (and not 22 scheduled languages). The number of languages recognized by Sahitya Akademi is not the same as the number of scheduled languages in India.  Option (a) is therefore the correct answer, accurately describing the function of the Radhakrishnan panel. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccurate information about the number of languages recognized by Sahitya Akademi in statement 2.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the PMRBP is indeed a prestigious award for children, the age group is typically 5-16 years (not 5-18 years). The award recognizes exceptional achievements in various fields, promoting excellence among young people. Statement 2 is incorrect. Good Governance Day commemorates the birth anniversary of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a former Prime Minister of India. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary is observed as National Unity Day.  Thus, both statements contain factual inaccuracies regarding the age criteria for PMRBP and the personality commemorated on Good Governance Day. Option (d) is the correct answer since both statements are factually incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain factual errors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Vasilopita is a traditional Greek New Year's cake, and the custom of baking a cake with a hidden coin symbolizing good luck is a well-known aspect of this tradition. This practice is linked to ancient Greek beliefs and customs related to fortune and prosperity. Statement 2 is incorrect. The term 'Panch Karma Sankalp' is not associated with sanitation and hygiene initiatives in Indian cities. It is a broader initiative focused on the development of northeastern states. Option (a) is therefore the correct answer, accurately describing the Vasilopita tradition. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 2 misrepresents the meaning of 'Panch Karma Sankalp'.

**3. With reference to ‘sportswashing’, consider the following statements:**

1. Sportswashing is a practice primarily employed by corporations to enhance their image after facing public criticism for unethical business practices.
2. The 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina is cited as an example of sportswashing, where the event masked the human rights abuses committed by the military junta.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplified. While corporations do engage in sportswashing, the practice is not limited to them; nations and individuals also use it to improve their damaged reputations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister of India during the 1971 Indo-Pak War, which led to the creation of Bangladesh,  it's inaccurate to say she *played a crucial role* in its *creation*. The phrasing is deliberately vague to create a distractor.  The liberation of Bangladesh was a complex event involving multiple factors and actors beyond Indira Gandhi's direct influence.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize. It is an annual award that recognizes outstanding contributions to peace, disarmament, and development, globally. This tests factual knowledge of the award and its purpose.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Annapurna Certificate Programme does recognize Indian restaurants abroad for their contributions to promoting Indian culinary traditions. However,  the statement incorrectly attributes the initiative to the Ministry of External Affairs. It is actually an initiative of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Maulana Abul Kalam Azad founded the ICCR in 1950, the Annapurna Certificate Programme is a more recent initiative of the ICCR and not directly founded by Azad. The statement attempts to combine unrelated facts about the ICCR and the Annapurna program to mislead candidates.


**16.  With reference to the  'Mule accounts', consider the following statements:**

1. Mule accounts are bank accounts used by individuals for legitimate financial transactions, often involving international money transfers.
2. MuleHunter.ai, an AI-based model developed by the Reserve Bank of India, helps banks detect mule accounts used for financial fraud.

2. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) and the WHO partnered in issuing the COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate and Health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Mosquirix vaccine is a malaria vaccine, not a COVID-19 vaccine. The statement uses a correctly named vaccine but misrepresents its purpose to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CAC and WHO collaborate on food safety and other health-related matters, the COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate and Health was a broader initiative involving many international organizations and nations beyond just the CAC and WHO. The statement correctly names the declaration and the two organizations but falsely suggests a direct partnership in its issuance.  The inclusion of the COP28 Declaration and the CAC serves as a distractor, leveraging the reader's knowledge of international collaborations on climate and health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the WHO report on WASH likely contains extensive data on various health issues linked to poor sanitation, there's no specific mention in the data provided that it includes data on TTS in Belize. The inclusion of TTS and Belize is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WHO does warn about the harms of e-cigarettes, but there is no evidence in the given data to suggest a specific link between e-cigarette use and TTS.  The connection between e-cigarettes and TTS is a fabricated link, designed to mislead the candidate.  The mention of TTS in both statements provides a plausible, yet incorrect, common thread to confuse the examinee.

**1. With reference to China's economic reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. The initial phase of China's economic reforms focused primarily on the industrial sector, with subsequent reforms extending to agriculture.
2.  China's agricultural reforms, initiated in 1978, involved the implementation of the household responsibility system, leading to increased agricultural output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  China's economic reforms began with significant changes in the agricultural sector in 1978, notably the introduction of the Household Responsibility System (HRS). This system replaced the collective farming system of the communes, allowing individual households to contract for land use and manage their production independently. This led to a dramatic increase in agricultural productivity and output.  Only subsequently did reforms extend to the industrial sector, focusing on the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and gradual market liberalization. The initial focus was on boosting agricultural output to alleviate food shortages and provide a foundation for broader economic development.

Statement 2 is correct. The Household Responsibility System (HRS), implemented as a key component of China’s agricultural reforms in 1978, significantly improved agricultural productivity and output.  By granting households greater autonomy in farming and allowing them to benefit directly from increased production, the HRS incentivized innovation and efficiency. This marked a departure from the previous centrally planned and collectivized agricultural system. This reform is considered a pivotal moment in China’s economic transformation.

2. India is the largest trading partner of China in South Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  China consistently ranks among the top global spenders on its military, with expenditure significantly higher than that of India. This reflects the differing geopolitical priorities and strategic ambitions of the two nations. This difference in military spending is a key factor influencing the regional power dynamics in Asia.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While bilateral trade between India and China is substantial, Bangladesh, not India, is China's largest trading partner in South Asia. This highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of trade relationships between countries and the need to verify claims about trade partnerships based on accurate data.  The statement misrepresents the actual ranking of India in China's South Asian trade relations.


**6. With reference to the geographical features of China, consider the following statements:**

1. The Yangtze River and the Yellow River both flow entirely within the boundaries of China.
2. The Taklamakan Desert is located in the western region of China.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both the Yangtze River and the Yellow River are major rivers in China, neither flows entirely within China's borders.  The Yangtze River, for instance, has its origins in the Tibetan Plateau and flows through several countries before reaching the East China Sea. Similarly, the Yellow River’s course extends across different regions. This demonstrates the importance of understanding the transboundary nature of major river systems and their geopolitical implications.

Statement 2 is correct. The Taklamakan Desert, one of the largest sandy deserts in the world, is indeed situated in the western region of China, in Xinjiang province.  This vast desert region plays a significant role in shaping the climate and environment of the region.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While China is actively researching and developing thorium molten salt reactor technology,  it has not yet successfully launched a commercial thorium molten salt nuclear power station. The statement prematurely claims a technological achievement that has not yet been realized.  This highlights the importance of distinguishing between research and development activities and actual operational deployment of technologies.

Statement 2 is correct. China is a global leader in the manufacturing of various energy transition technologies. Its dominance in solar panel and battery production is particularly noteworthy. This reflects China's strategic investment in renewable energy technologies and its ambitions to become a global leader in this sector.  This position in the renewable energy sector holds significant implications for global efforts to mitigate climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. China asserts a claim over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.  This claim is strongly contested by Japan, which currently administers the islands.  The dispute highlights the complexities of territorial claims in the East China Sea and the potential for escalating tensions between China and Japan.

Statement 2 is incorrect. China's claim to the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea is heavily disputed by several other nations, including Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines. These territorial disputes are a major source of tension and conflict in the region.  The statement incorrectly presents China's claim as undisputed, ignoring the significant opposition from other claimant states.  This underscores the importance of understanding the complexities of maritime territorial disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is not a clearly demarcated border. It is a disputed and undefined boundary, which has been the source of numerous border incidents and standoffs between India and China. The lack of a clearly defined boundary contributes to the complexity and potential for conflict along the LAC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India and China have not resolved all their border disputes.  Significant disagreements persist, particularly concerning the LAC in the western and eastern sectors.  These unresolved disputes remain a major challenge to the bilateral relationship between the two countries.  The statement is factually inaccurate.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Nepal is a landlocked country bordered by India to the south and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north.  Its border with India extends across five Indian states: Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, West Bengal, and Sikkim. This geographical location has significant implications for Nepal's foreign policy and its relations with both its neighbours.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kali River, also known as the Mahakali River, is a significant transboundary river that flows along a section of the border between Nepal and India. This river's course and water-sharing arrangements have been the subject of some dispute and negotiations between the two countries.  The statement accurately identifies the river's role in the Nepal-India border demarcation.

1.  The rebellion was primarily a response to the injustices faced by the Santhal community under the British Raj, including land dispossession and exploitative revenue systems.
2.  The rebellion was primarily led by figures like Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, and was characterized by its widespread participation and resistance against British colonial rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Santhal Rebellion, a significant uprising in the mid-19th century, was fueled by the British colonial administration's exploitative policies. The Permanent Settlement Act of 1793, for example, led to land dispossession and increased pressure on Santhal communities.  Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu emerged as key leaders, mobilizing widespread Santhal participation in the rebellion against the perceived injustices and the British colonial state.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect crucial aspects of this historical event.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to capture the multifaceted nature of the rebellion, which involved both socio-economic grievances and direct political resistance.


**2. With reference to Warli painting, consider the following statements:**

1. Warli paintings are primarily characterized by their use of vibrant, richly saturated colors and intricate detailing.
2. The subject matter of Warli paintings frequently depicts scenes from daily life, rituals, and celebrations within the Warli community.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Warli painting, a tribal art form from Maharashtra, is known for its distinctive style.  While it does use color, it is primarily characterized by its use of simple, earthy tones, particularly white on a red or black background. The intricate detailing is present but is not the defining characteristic as much as the simplistic style and the use of geometric forms. The paintings predominantly depict scenes from daily rural life, religious events, and social gatherings of the Warli people.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it misrepresents the color palette; statement 2 correctly identifies a key feature of Warli art. Option (b) is thus the correct answer.


**3. With reference to Alluri Sitarama Raju, consider the following statements:**

1. Alluri Sitarama Raju was a prominent leader of the Rampa Rebellion, known for his charismatic leadership and use of guerilla warfare tactics against the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Alluri Sitarama Raju was indeed a key figure in the Rampa Rebellion, a significant tribal uprising in the early 20th century in Andhra Pradesh. His leadership was crucial in coordinating resistance against British rule. The rebellion was deeply rooted in the socio-economic grievances of the tribal population, particularly regarding British forest policies that restricted access to tribal lands and resources, and the imposition of heavy taxes.  Both statements accurately reflect his role and the motivations behind the rebellion.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to fully describe the context and significance of Alluri Sitarama Raju's actions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNESCO City of Literature designation is not solely based on the quantity of literary works produced. While a rich literary history and production are important, the program's focus is broader. It considers factors such as the city's literary infrastructure, its commitment to literary activities, and its role in fostering a vibrant literary culture. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  However, the program strongly emphasizes international cooperation and the sharing of best practices among cities to promote literature globally. Statement 2 accurately reflects this key aspect of the UNESCO initiative.  Thus, only statement 2 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While primarily used by Sikh pilgrims, the Kartarpur Corridor is not exclusively limited to them.  Other nationalities can also use it to visit the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The Kartarpur Corridor's inauguration did, however, coincide with the 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev in 2019, making it a significant event in the Sikh religious calendar and highlighting its historical and religious significance. Statement 2 is correct. Therefore, option (b) is the only correct answer.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

The goal of complete independence was more clearly articulated later, particularly during the Civil Disobedience Movement.  The initial focus was on non-cooperation with British rule through various methods like boycotts and civil disobedience.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Non-Cooperation Movement had a broad base of participation, encompassing both urban and rural areas. While urban centers saw significant participation from students, professionals, and the middle class, the movement also resonated in rural areas through the involvement of peasants and some tribal communities, although the level of participation varied regionally.  The movement's success was partially contingent on this widespread participation across different social strata and geographical locations.  The limited involvement of rural populations is a misrepresentation of historical evidence.


**2. With reference to Bal Gangadhar Tilak, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tilak's newspaper, *Kesari*, primarily focused on promoting religious harmony and interfaith dialogue.
2.  Tilak's advocacy for Swaraj was characterized by a staunch commitment to non-violent methods of resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While *Kesari* did address social issues, its main focus was on criticizing British policies and advocating for Indian self-rule (Swaraj).  It often served as a platform for nationalist sentiments and criticisms of the colonial government, rather than solely promoting religious harmony.  The newspaper played a significant role in mobilizing nationalist support, especially amongst the Marathi-speaking population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Tilak's approach to Swaraj was more aligned with what is often termed "militant nationalism."  While he didn't advocate for violent revolution in the same way as some revolutionary groups, his methods were not strictly non-violent. He believed in assertive and at times forceful methods to achieve self-rule, including the use of Swadeshi and Boycott movements. His philosophy differed from Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance.


**3. With reference to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The HRA's primary aim was to establish a socialist republic in India based on the principles of Marxism.
2.  Chandra Shekhar Azad was a founding member and played a crucial role in the organization's early activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HRA's primary goal was to overthrow British rule and establish a republic in India, but their ideology was not strictly Marxist or solely focused on socialist principles. While some members held socialist leanings, the organization's focus was more on achieving independence through revolutionary means, encompassing a broader range of nationalist ideologies.  Their vision of a republic was influenced by various nationalist thoughts of the time.

Statement 2 is correct. While the exact founding members are debated, Chandra Shekhar Azad was a key figure in the HRA. He played a significant role in its reorganization and was involved in various revolutionary activities undertaken by the group.  He was instrumental in shaping the HRA's strategy and operations, though he wasn't the sole founder.


**4. With reference to Kalaripayattu, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kalaripayattu's techniques are solely focused on unarmed combat and self-defense.
2.  The martial art has its origins in the ancient Tamil kingdoms of South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kalaripayattu is a comprehensive martial art that incorporates both armed and unarmed combat techniques. It emphasizes the use of various weapons alongside hand-to-hand fighting skills.  The training also integrates aspects of Ayurveda and traditional medicine.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kalaripayattu's roots are ancient, its origins are primarily associated with the Malabar region of Kerala, not the Tamil kingdoms.  Although the exact origins are debated and there are similarities with other South Indian martial arts, the dominant historical evidence points to Kerala as its primary place of origin and development.


**5. With reference to the Lingayats, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lingayats primarily follow the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism.
2.  The Lingayat sect's core beliefs are based on the teachings of the 12th-century social reformer Basavanna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Lingayats are a Shaiva sect within Hinduism, not Vaishnava.  Their worship centers on Shiva, often symbolized by the *linga*. They have their unique theological interpretations and practices within the broader framework of Hinduism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Basavanna, a 12th-century social reformer, is considered the founder of the Lingayat movement. His teachings, emphasizing social equality, rejection of the caste system, and devotion to Shiva, formed the core tenets of the Lingayat faith.  His influence on the sect's development is undeniable.


**6. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple is situated to the west of the Mahabodhi Tree.
2.  The temple was originally built during the Gupta period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple stands to the *east* of the Mahabodhi Tree, where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.  The temple's orientation and proximity to the tree are significant aspects of its historical and religious importance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the exact date of the temple’s construction is debated,  the present structure is not from the Gupta period. The current temple has undergone numerous renovations and expansions throughout history, with significant additions and changes over centuries.  However, earlier structures did exist on the site.


**7.  With reference to the Humayun's Tomb, consider the following statements:**

1.  The tomb was constructed by Humayun's father, Babur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Humayun's Tomb was built by his son, Akbar, not Babur.  Akbar commissioned the construction of the magnificent tomb in Delhi to honor his father.  The construction is a significant example of Mughal architecture, reflecting the changing styles during Akbar's reign.

Statement 2 is correct. Humayun's Tomb, with its innovative garden-tomb design and architectural features,  served as a major influence on subsequent Mughal architectural projects.  The design elements and structural style of the tomb directly inspired later Mughal buildings, including the Taj Mahal.  Its impact on the development of Mughal architecture is well-documented.



**8. With reference to Tell Umm Amer (Saint Hilarion Monastery), consider the following statements:**

1. The monastery is located in present-day Syria.
2.  The site's inclusion on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger is primarily due to neglect and lack of preservation efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Tell Umm Amer (Saint Hilarion Monastery) is situated in present-day *Palestine*, not Syria. Its geographical location within Palestine is crucial to understanding its historical context and significance.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While neglect can be a factor, the primary reason for its inclusion on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger is its proximity to major trade and communication routes, making it vulnerable to various threats, including potential conflict and damage from development projects along those routes. The vulnerability stems from external factors rather than solely from lack of preservation.



**9. With reference to  Madhubani paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. Madhubani paintings predominantly feature abstract designs and geometric patterns.
2. The art form is primarily practiced in the state of West Bengal.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Madhubani paintings incorporate figurative elements depicting deities, animals, and scenes from mythology, they are characterized by their use of vibrant colors, bold lines, and geometric patterns. The style often integrates geometric forms within the depiction of figures and scenes. The artistic style is distinct and easily identifiable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Madhubani painting is primarily associated with the Mithila region of *Bihar*, not West Bengal.  The art form is deeply rooted in the cultural traditions of the Mithila region and is strongly linked to its history and religious practices.


**10. With reference to the  Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda was a staunch opponent of the introduction of Western ideas and philosophies into India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Swami Vivekananda did not oppose Western ideas entirely. He recognized the value of some aspects of Western thought and culture, particularly the emphasis on scientific inquiry and rational thought.  However, he emphasized the importance of integrating Western rationalism with traditional Indian spirituality.

Statement 2 is correct. Swami Vivekananda is widely known for his efforts to reconcile modern science with traditional Indian spiritual philosophies. He believed that both science and spirituality could complement each other in understanding the world and human existence.  His interpretation of Vedanta philosophy and his articulation of it to Western audiences helped bridge this gap.  His emphasis on a rational and scientific approach to religion was a defining aspect of his teachings.

**1. With reference to Project PARI, consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI, initiated by the Ministry of Culture, exclusively focuses on reviving traditional Indian art forms like Phad, Thangka, and Gond paintings.
2. The Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art are among the key executing agencies for Project PARI.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Project PARI does draw inspiration from and incorporate millennia of Indian artistic heritage, including the art forms mentioned (Phad, Thangka, and Gond paintings), it explicitly aims to incorporate *modern themes and techniques*.  The project's scope is not limited to the exclusive revival of traditional art forms. It seeks a synthesis of the old and the new.  The statement presents an overly narrow interpretation of the project's objectives.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided context clearly indicates that Project PARI involves artists from across the country in creating wall paintings, murals, sculptures, and installations.  While the Ministry of Culture initiates the project, its execution naturally requires the involvement of established art organizations like the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, which possess the resources and expertise to manage such a large-scale undertaking. These institutions are well-suited to oversee the artistic aspects and logistical requirements of the project.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Khandagiri and Udayagiri caves:**

1.  These caves, primarily built for Buddhist monks, were discovered by Andrew Sterling in the 19th century CE.
2.  Originally comprising around 117 caves, only 33 survive today, with 18 situated on Udayagiri hill and 15 on Khandagiri hill.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The caves were built for Jain monks, not Buddhist monks, around the 2nd century BCE by King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty.  The statement incorrectly identifies the religious affiliation of the cave's inhabitants and the century of their construction.  The British officer Andrew Sterling's discovery in the 19th century CE is a correct fact but is insufficient to make the whole statement correct.


Statement 2 is correct and accurately reflects the information provided.  The original number of caves, the number surviving, and their distribution across Udayagiri and Khandagiri hills are all correctly stated. This statement presents precise numerical data which is crucial for verifying its accuracy. The details in this statement are not easily forgotten if one studies the topic.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The news reports correctly mention the discovery of the world's oldest cave paintings in the Maros-Pangkep region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and the depiction of human-like figures interacting with a wild pig (not explicitly hunting, but the inference is plausible). The age of at least 45,500 years is also correctly reported. This statement provides specific details that are memorable and easily verifiable.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies the Leang Tedongnge cave in Sulawesi as previously holding the record for oldest-known cave paintings; however, it gives an incorrect age of at least 43,500 years.  The actual age, according to the provided information, is at least 45,500 years old.  This minor inaccuracy renders the statement false.  The slight alteration in the age makes the statement incorrect.


**4. With reference to classical languages in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Marathi and Tamil are both currently recognized as classical languages in India.
2.  The criteria for granting classical language status include a rich body of ancient literature and significant cultural influence.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that Tamil is a classical language, but Marathi is not. The statement incorrectly includes Marathi in the list of classical languages of India. This constitutes a significant factual error.


Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that the government is revising the criteria for granting classical language status to be more inclusive.  However, the core element of the criteria—a rich body of ancient literature and significant cultural influence—remains central to the assessment.  The statement correctly identifies a key aspect of the criteria, even though the process of evaluation is undergoing review.  This statement highlights a key and often-tested aspect of Indian linguistic policy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kartarpur Corridor does connect Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan to India, it does *not* provide visa-free movement for *all* Indian pilgrims.  The text explicitly mentions that a permit is required to cross into Pakistan through the corridor. The statement omits this crucial qualification, making it inaccurate.


Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the corridor was inaugurated to celebrate Guru Nanak Dev's 550th birth anniversary in 2019. This is a clearly stated fact, easily verifiable and relevant to understanding the historical context of the corridor's establishment.


**6. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom Dynasty's "Moidams," recommended for UNESCO World Heritage status, are ancient burial mounds located in Assam's Dibrugarh district.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies the Moidams as ancient burial mounds of the Ahom Dynasty located in Assam and their recommendation for UNESCO World Heritage status. However, it incorrectly places them in Dibrugarh district. The correct location is Charaideo district, a fact easily missed if not meticulously studied.


Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Moidams as pyramid-like structures serving as final resting places for Ahom royalty, preserving their remains and associated objects.  This statement conveys the essence of the Moidams and their cultural significance.




**7. With reference to Kharchi Puja, consider the following statements:**

1. Kharchi Puja, a festival celebrated mainly in Tripura, is a primarily tribal festival dedicated to the worship of fourteen goddesses.
2. The term "Kharchi" originates from Tripuri words meaning "sin" and "cleaning," signifying the cleansing of sins during the festival.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While Kharchi Puja is celebrated by both tribal and non-tribal people of Tripura, its origins are tribal.  The festival is centered around the worship of Chaturdasa Devata (fourteen deities), not fourteen goddesses.  While the text doesn't explicitly state their gender, the use of the term 'Devata' (deities) which is a gender-neutral term in this context. The statement is partially correct but the slight inaccuracy in the number of goddesses makes this statement incorrect.


Statement 2 is correct. The explanation of the word "Kharchi" as derived from Tripuri words for "sin" and "cleaning" is accurate, reflecting the festival's symbolic meaning of purification. This is a precise etymological explanation, crucial for UPSC-level understanding of cultural practices.


**8. With reference to Raja Rammohan Roy, consider the following statements:**

1. Raja Rammohan Roy, a staunch proponent of monotheism, primarily focused on reforming Islamic practices in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Raja Rammohan Roy was a strong advocate of monotheism, his reform efforts primarily targeted Hindu practices and social customs, not Islamic ones. The statement misrepresents the focus of his reformist activities, making it inaccurate.


Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately states that Roy translated the Vedas and Upanishads into Bengali to support his belief that ancient Hindu texts supported monotheism. This action reflects his approach to religious reform and his scholarship.  This is a significant detail about his intellectual contributions.


**9. With reference to Aruna Asaf Ali, consider the following statements:**

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies Aruna Asaf Ali's significant role in the Indian freedom struggle and her title. However, it wrongly states she became the first woman Chief Minister of Delhi post-independence. She was Delhi's first Mayor, not Chief Minister.  This is a crucial distinction often missed.


Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately mentions her participation in the Salt Satyagraha and her hunger strike to improve the conditions of prisoners in Tihar Jail. This statement provides specific details about her activism.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies Gopal Krishna Gokhale as the founder of the Servants of India Society and the year of its founding. However, it misrepresents the Society's primary aim.  The Society's goal was to train national missionaries for the service of India and to promote the true interests of the Indian people through constitutional means—not primarily to promote industrialization. The statement misinterprets the Society's focus.


Statement 2 is largely correct.  The text correctly identifies the Society's aim to train selfless workers dedicated to India's cause. While the text doesn't explicitly mention collaboration with the Social Service League, the two organizations shared a common goal of national service and social upliftment, making the implied collaboration plausible.


**11. With reference to the  "Mata ni Pachedi" art form, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mata ni Pachedi, a traditional textile art form of Gujarat, is primarily created using the Kalamkari technique.
2.  These intricate textiles typically depict scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, showcasing religious narratives.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The provided information mentions Pattachitra as an art form of Odisha, often executed on cloth (not exclusively palm leaf) and depicting various religious and mythological themes, including the Ramayana and Mahabharata.  The slight inaccuracy regarding the material doesn't make the whole statement incorrect.


Statement 2 is correct. Raghurajpur's prominence as a center for Pattachitra and its association with Jagannath and Vaishnava cult are correctly stated. This statement provides specific geographical and cultural details.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The statement correctly identifies the influence of Vijayanagara and Nayaka painting styles on Kerala murals. While Kerala murals depict a wide range of subjects, including mythological scenes, religious narratives, and aspects of daily life, their connection to the Mahabharata is significant enough to not make the statement entirely false.


Statement 2 is correct.  The use of natural pigments on plastered walls and the intricate detailing are accurate characteristics of Kerala murals.  This statement highlights the artistic techniques.


**15. With reference to Bani Thani paintings, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The caves are located near Bhubaneswar, but they were built during the reign of King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty (not the Gupta dynasty), and are associated with Jain monastic traditions, not Buddhist ones.  The statement contains multiple inaccuracies regarding the dynasty, religious affiliation, and the number of caves.


Statement 2 is partially correct in that a significant number of caves do survive. However, it incorrectly states the original number of caves and misrepresents the religious affiliation as Buddhist. The original number was around 117, and the surviving caves showcase Jain art and architecture.

1.  Located in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, these Buddhist cave monuments date back to the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The location, dating, and religious affiliation of the Ajanta Caves are accurately described. The statement provides precise chronological data and geographical details.


Statement 2 is partially correct, but not entirely accurate.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The location on Elephanta Island in Mumbai harbour and the dedication to Hindu deities are accurate. However, the construction date is incorrect; the caves date back to the mid-5th to 6th centuries CE, not the 1st century CE.  This significant error in chronology makes the statement incorrect.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and feature intricate carvings, they are primarily dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, not Vishnu. The statement incorrectly identifies the principal deity depicted in the caves.

Statement 1 is partially correct. The statement mentions a key aspect of the criteria for classical language status – a long and unbroken literary tradition and a rich body of ancient literature. However, the specified time frame of "over 1500 years" isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, and the precise criteria may vary slightly depending on how 'long' is defined.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The given text lists six classical languages: Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia. Bengali is not currently included in this list. This constitutes a significant factual error.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.

**1. With reference to the Amazon rainforest and its nutrient sources, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Amazon rainforest's primary nutrient source is volcanic ash deposits from the Andes Mountains, making it exceptionally fertile.
2.  Significant nutrient inputs to the Amazon rainforest are derived from atmospheric deposition of dust originating from the Sahara Desert and other distant sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While volcanic activity in the Andes contributes to soil fertility in some areas surrounding the Amazon, the Amazon rainforest's soil is generally nutrient-poor. Its high biodiversity is paradoxically maintained by a complex system of nutrient cycling, primarily relying on the rapid decomposition of organic matter.  The soil is characterized by low cation exchange capacity, meaning it doesn't retain essential nutrients well.  The fertility is largely dependent on the constant recycling of nutrients within the ecosystem itself, not primarily on external sources like volcanic ash.

Statement 2 is correct.  A significant portion of the Amazon's nutrient supply comes from atmospheric deposition, particularly dust transported from distant locations like the Sahara Desert. This dust contains essential nutrients, such as phosphorus, which are limited in the Amazonian soil. The nutrient-poor soils of the Amazon are a key factor explaining its dependence on nutrient cycling and the importance of this long-distance atmospheric transport.  This phenomenon highlights the interconnectedness of global ecosystems and the role of atmospheric processes in maintaining regional biodiversity.  The Amazon’s reliance on this distant source of nutrients makes it particularly vulnerable to changes in global wind patterns and desertification in source regions.


**2. With reference to Peru's economic activities and natural resources, consider the following statements:**

1.  Peru's economy is predominantly driven by its vast oil reserves, which constitute a major export commodity.
2.  Zinc production is a significant contributor to Peru's GDP, fueled by substantial zinc reserves within the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Peru does possess oil reserves and oil production contributes to its economy, it's not the dominant driver. Peru's economy is considerably more diversified, with significant contributions from mining (including other minerals beyond oil), agriculture, and the service sector.  Mining, particularly of minerals like copper and gold, plays a far more substantial role in Peru's export earnings and GDP than oil production.  Over-reliance on a single resource sector can make an economy vulnerable to price fluctuations and market changes.

Statement 2 is correct. Peru possesses significant zinc reserves and is a major global producer of zinc.  Zinc mining and its associated industries contribute considerably to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and export revenue. This demonstrates Peru's reliance on its mineral wealth for economic growth, but also points to potential economic vulnerabilities if global zinc prices decline or if environmental concerns related to mining impact production.  The country's economic diversification efforts are crucial for mitigating such risks.

These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills, aligning with the difficulty level expected in UPSC examinations.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, testing the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the functioning of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council's decisions on tax rates are binding on both the Union and State Governments.
2.  The Council's Chairperson is appointed by the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GST Council is a crucial body for India's indirect tax system. However, its decisions regarding tax rates are recommendations, not legally binding orders.  While the Council's recommendations carry significant weight and are generally followed, the Union and State Governments retain the autonomy to make final decisions within their respective jurisdictions.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Furthermore, the Chairperson of the GST Council is the Union Finance Minister, not someone appointed by the President of India.  The Union Finance Minister's position is determined by the political executive, not through presidential appointment. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Thus, neither statement is correct. This highlights the nuanced nature of Centre-State relations in the Indian federal system and the practical limitations on the GST Council's authority despite its importance.


**2. With reference to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SAT's Presiding Officer is appointed by the President of India.
2.  The SAT has appellate jurisdiction only over matters related to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The SAT is an important quasi-judicial body in India's financial regulatory framework. However, its Presiding Officer is appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of India, not directly by the President. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Moreover, the SAT's appellate jurisdiction extends beyond SEBI. It also hears appeals against orders passed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).  Statement 2 is thus incorrect.  The incorrectness of both statements underscores the need for careful understanding of the SAT's composition and functioning within the broader context of India's financial regulatory architecture.


**3. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  A deficit in the current account indicates that a country's foreign exchange earnings are exceeding its foreign exchange
     expenditure.
2.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is recorded under the capital account of the BoP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The BoP is a crucial macroeconomic indicator reflecting a country's transactions with the rest of the world. A current account deficit signifies that a nation's payments for imports and other transactions exceed its receipts from exports and other sources. This implies a net outflow of foreign exchange, contradicting statement 1, which makes it incorrect.  Conversely, FDI, representing long-term capital flows, is indeed recorded under the capital account of the BoP, not the current account.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The distinction between the current and capital accounts is vital for understanding a country's external financial position and its implications for macroeconomic stability.


**4. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) launched the Financial Inclusion Index in 2021.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Inclusion Index is a significant metric for evaluating progress toward broader financial access. However, the index was not launched by the RBI but by the Ministry of Finance. The RBI plays a crucial role in financial inclusion, but the index's creation and dissemination are the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Furthermore, the Index encompasses three key parameters: access, usage, and quality of financial services.  It's not limited to just access and usage, thus making statement 2 incorrect. The comprehensive nature of the index is crucial for understanding the depth and quality of financial inclusion beyond simple metrics.

**Explanation:**

The Economic Survey is a crucial document providing insights into India's economic performance and prospects. It is prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, under the guidance of the Chief Economic Advisor. Statement 1 is correct.  Furthermore, the Survey is indeed presented to the Parliament along with the Union Budget, providing valuable context for the budget's framing and policy implications. Statement 2 is also correct. The timing and authorship of the Economic Survey are important aspects to understand its role in policymaking.


**13. With reference to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), consider the following statements:**

1.  WIPO is a specialized agency of the United Nations.
2.  WIPO's primary function is to protect the intellectual property rights of only developed countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

WIPO is a critical international organization dealing with intellectual property rights. It is indeed a specialized agency of the United Nations, actively promoting international cooperation in intellectual property matters.  Statement 1 is correct.  However, WIPO's mandate extends to protecting the intellectual property rights of all its member countries, regardless of their development status.  Its goal is to foster innovation and creativity globally, not just for developed nations.  Statement 2 is therefore incorrect. WIPO's global reach and its focus on equitable access to intellectual property protection are important aspects of its work.


**14. With reference to Capital Gains Tax, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a form of indirect tax levied on the profits from the sale of assets.
2.  Short-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than long-term capital gains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Capital Gains Tax is an important component of India's tax system.  It's a direct tax, not an indirect tax, levied on the profits from the sale of assets like stocks, property, and other investments.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Furthermore, short-term capital gains are generally taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains, reflecting the principle of progressive taxation, making statement 2 incorrect.  The nature of Capital Gains Tax as a direct tax and the differential tax rates for short-term and long-term gains are essential for comprehending India's tax structure.


**15. With reference to Cooperative Banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cooperative banks are solely regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  Cooperative banks are primarily involved in providing credit to the agricultural sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Cooperative banks are a unique segment of the Indian banking system.  While the RBI plays a significant regulatory role, it is not the sole regulator; state governments also have regulatory powers over cooperative banks registered within their jurisdiction.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Furthermore, although cooperative banks provide credit to the agricultural sector, their operations extend to other sectors as well, including small businesses and individuals.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The dual regulatory oversight and the diversification of lending operations within cooperative banks are essential for understanding their role in India's financial landscape.


**16.  Consider the following statements about the components of the Current Account:**

1.  Government aid is a component of the current account.
2.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a component of the current account.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The current account of the Balance of Payments (BoP) records transactions related to the import and export of goods and services, as well as income receipts and payments, and unilateral transfers. Government aid, being a transfer payment, is part of this account. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  FDI, on the other hand, is a capital flow and is recorded under the capital account of the BoP, not the current account.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The clear distinction between current and capital account transactions is fundamental to understanding international economics.



**17. With reference to stablecoins, consider the following statements:**

1.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is always pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.
2.  The primary purpose of stablecoins is to mitigate the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. While many stablecoins aim for a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, this is not always the case; some are pegged to other assets or baskets of assets.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The core function of stablecoins is to offer a more stable alternative to other cryptocurrencies, reducing the risks associated with their price fluctuations.  This makes statement 2 correct.  The understanding of stablecoins requires a nuanced knowledge of their mechanisms and the challenges in maintaining price stability.


**18. With reference to India's BoP, consider the following statements:**

1. A current account surplus implies that India's foreign exchange reserves are decreasing.
2.  A capital account deficit implies that India's net foreign liabilities are increasing.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India's BoP reflects its international transactions. A current account surplus suggests that India's foreign exchange earnings exceed its expenditure, leading to an increase in its foreign exchange reserves, making statement 1 incorrect. A capital account deficit, however, means that capital outflows (e.g., investments abroad) exceed inflows, resulting in a net increase in foreign liabilities. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  Understanding the relationship between BoP components and foreign exchange reserves is crucial for macroeconomic analysis.


**19.  With reference to white and brown goods, consider the following statements:**

1. White goods are typically lighter and less durable than brown goods.
2. Brown goods typically consume more energy than white goods.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The classification of consumer durables into white and brown goods is based on their characteristics. White goods, encompassing items like refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners, are generally heavier and more durable than brown goods (TVs, radios, and audio systems).  Statement 1 is correct.  Brown goods typically consume less energy compared to white goods, which often use more power-intensive components. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The distinction between white and brown goods is primarily based on their weight and durability, but their energy consumption can vary depending on specific models and technology.


**20. With reference to the Upper Siang Hydropower Project, consider the following statements:**

1.  The project is located in Assam.
2.  The project is expected to significantly impact the biodiversity of the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Upper Siang Hydropower Project is a significant infrastructure initiative. However, it's located in Arunachal Pradesh, not Assam.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Large hydropower projects often have considerable environmental and biodiversity impacts, including habitat alteration and disruption of ecological processes.  The Upper Siang project is likely to affect the region's biodiversity, making statement 2 correct.  The location of the project and its potential environmental consequences are crucial for evaluating its overall impact.


**21. With reference to Makhana (fox nuts), consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the largest producer of Makhana globally.
2.  Bihar is a major producer of Makhana in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Makhana is an aquatic crop with growing economic importance.  India is indeed the largest producer of Makhana worldwide, meeting a significant portion of global demand.  Statement 1 is correct. Bihar is also a major producer of Makhana within India.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  The global and domestic production of Makhana highlights the crop's significance in both international and regional markets.


**22. With reference to the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the Union Government.
2.  The Finance Commission is constituted every five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission is a crucial constitutional body for India's fiscal federalism.  However, its recommendations are not legally binding on the Union Government; they are considered recommendations. While generally followed, the government retains the power to make its own decisions. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Finance Commission is indeed constituted every five years to review the financial position of the Union and the States and to recommend the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and duties between them.  Statement 2 is correct.  The non-binding nature of the recommendations and the five-year term of the commission are crucial aspects of its role in India's fiscal architecture.


**23. With reference to the components of the Current Account, consider the following statements:**

1.  Foreign assets are a component of the current account.
2.  Balance of invisibles is a component of the current account.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The current account of the BoP encompasses several key elements. Foreign assets are recorded under the capital account, not the current account. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The balance of invisibles, encompassing services and transfers, is a key component of the current account.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The accurate classification of BoP components is crucial for a clear understanding of a country's international economic activity.


**24. With reference to the terms and allocation of collateral between common lenders in the event of a borrower's default, consider the following statements:**

1.  In case of default, the borrower retains exclusive rights over the collateral.
2.  The hierarchy among various creditors concerning collateral payment is established.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Collateral management in lending is crucial for risk mitigation.  In case of a borrower's default, the borrower does not retain exclusive rights over the collateral; the lenders have claims on it. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  There is a defined hierarchy among various creditors regarding the priority of payment from the collateral.  This hierarchy is established through legal contracts and regulatory frameworks.  Statement 2 is correct.  Understanding this hierarchy and the process of collateral recovery is essential for financial risk management.


**25. With reference to Jabiluka, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jabiluka is a significant uranium mining site in Australia.
2.  Uranium mining at Jabiluka has been banned due to environmental concerns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jabiluka is indeed a significant uranium deposit located in Australia's Northern Territory.  Statement 1 is correct.  Due to significant environmental concerns and Aboriginal land rights issues, uranium mining at Jabiluka has been effectively banned, though not through a formal national ban. The cessation of mining activities at Jabiluka reflects the increasing focus on environmental protection and indigenous rights in relation to resource extraction.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The combination of resource location and the environmental/social context of mining operations is important in understanding resource management policies.

**1. With reference to Cooperative Banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) solely determines the lending norms for these banks, overriding any other regulatory influence.
2.  These banks are exclusively owned and operated by the government, ensuring complete public control over their operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating cooperative banks, it doesn't solely determine lending norms.  The government, through various ministries and departments, also influences lending policies, particularly regarding priority sector lending.  Furthermore, state-level cooperative societies acts and regulations also impact their operations.  The RBI's role is primarily supervisory and regulatory, ensuring financial stability and adherence to banking regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cooperative banks are not exclusively owned and operated by the government. They are member-owned institutions, with members acting as both owners and customers.  The government's role is primarily regulatory and supervisory, aiming to maintain the stability and soundness of the cooperative banking sector.  The ownership structure varies; some may have a greater government presence than others, but it's never exclusive.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI's primary function is exclusively focused on managing the government's fiscal deficit, leaving monetary policy considerations secondary.
2.  The RBI prints currency notes solely for the Government of India, with no involvement in circulation or management beyond the initial printing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI works closely with the government, its primary function is not solely focused on managing the fiscal deficit.  The RBI's core mandate is to maintain price stability and manage the monetary policy of the nation.  Fiscal deficit management is a government responsibility, although the RBI's actions can have an impact on it.  The RBI's role is to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to sustainable economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI's responsibilities extend far beyond the initial printing of currency notes.  It is responsible for the circulation and management of currency notes and coins within the economy. This includes managing currency supply, replacing worn-out notes, and ensuring the smooth functioning of the payment system.  The RBI's role is crucial in maintaining the integrity and stability of the Indian currency.


**3. With reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The LCR is a long-term measure designed to assess a bank's overall financial health and solvency over many years.
2.  A high LCR guarantees that a bank will never face liquidity issues, eliminating the risk of financial crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LCR is a short-term liquidity measure, not a long-term assessment of a bank's financial health. It focuses on a bank's ability to withstand short-term liquidity stress during a crisis lasting up to 30 days.  Long-term financial health is assessed through other metrics and regulatory frameworks.  The LCR is a crucial element of Basel III regulatory standards, aimed at preventing short-term banking crises.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A high LCR significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of liquidity problems.  While a high LCR suggests a bank is well-prepared to handle short-term liquidity shocks, unforeseen events or systemic crises could still impact its liquidity.  The LCR provides a safety net, not an absolute guarantee against all liquidity risks.  It's a crucial tool for managing liquidity risks, but not a foolproof solution.


**4. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is primarily focused on short-term, high-risk investments to stimulate quick economic returns.
2. NaBFID is solely regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), ensuring its alignment with capital market regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID's core mandate is long-term infrastructure financing, not short-term, high-risk investments. Its objective is to provide long-term, non-recourse finance to bridge the gap in long-term funding for infrastructure projects.  This approach aims for sustainable and stable economic growth, prioritizing long-term development over immediate returns.  Short-term investments are not its primary focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  As an All India Financial Institution (AIFI), it falls under the RBI's regulatory purview. SEBI's role is in regulating the capital markets.  The RBI's oversight focuses on NaBFID's financial stability and adherence to regulatory standards for financial institutions.


**5. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Council is an advisory body with no binding power on the Union and State governments regarding GST-related matters.  Its recommendations are purely suggestive.
2. The Union Finance Minister holds a two-thirds majority voting power in the GST Council, ensuring central control over GST policy decisions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GST Council's recommendations are not merely suggestive; they hold significant weight. While not legally binding, the Council's recommendations are generally followed by both the Union and State governments.  Its decisions shape the GST framework significantly, impacting tax rates, exemptions, and other crucial aspects.  The Council plays a central role in shaping GST policy and resolving disputes between the Centre and States.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Finance Minister does not hold a two-thirds majority voting power. The voting power is distributed as one-third for the Centre and two-thirds for the States collectively.  This structure reflects the federal nature of the Indian government and ensures that States have a significant voice in GST policymaking.  The consensus-building nature of the Council is crucial for its effectiveness.


**6. With reference to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), consider the following statements:**

1. The SAT is a non-statutory body established by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to hear appeals related to SEBI orders.
2. The SAT's jurisdiction is limited to the state where its bench is located, restricting its reach geographically.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SAT is a statutory body, not a non-statutory body established under the SEBI Act, 1992. It's an independent appellate tribunal established to hear and dispose of appeals against orders passed by SEBI and other related regulatory bodies.  Its establishment ensures an independent avenue for appeal against regulatory decisions. The independence of the SAT is crucial for protecting investor rights and ensuring fair practices in the securities market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SAT's jurisdiction extends across the whole of India, despite having a single bench.  This broad jurisdiction ensures that appeals from any part of the country can be heard and addressed efficiently by the tribunal.  The pan-India jurisdiction of the SAT is essential for a uniform application of securities laws and regulations across India.


**7. With reference to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), consider the following statements:**

1. APEDA's primary function is to promote imports of agricultural and processed food products to enhance domestic availability.
2. APEDA facilitates the registration of Geographical Indications (GIs) for Indian products only within India and does not assist with international GI registration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. APEDA's primary focus is export promotion, not import promotion. It aims to boost the export of agricultural and processed food products from India, enhancing the country's presence in the global market.  Import promotion is not within its mandate.  APEDA's role in supporting the export sector is crucial for India's agricultural economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. APEDA does facilitate GI registration for Indian products abroad, providing crucial protection and recognition for these products in international markets.  Its role in protecting Indian GIs internationally is crucial for maintaining the quality and reputation of these products in the global marketplace.  This support for international GI registration is a significant aspect of APEDA's functions.


**8. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. The BoP only records transactions in goods, excluding services and asset transactions.
2. A current account surplus indicates that a country is spending more on imports than it is earning from exports and other receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BoP records transactions in goods, services, and assets between residents of a country and the rest of the world. It provides a comprehensive picture of a nation's economic interactions with other countries.  Excluding services and asset transactions would provide an incomplete and misleading picture of the country's external economic position. The comprehensiveness of the BoP is key to understanding a country's international economic relationships.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A current account surplus indicates that a country is earning more from exports and other receipts than it is spending on imports.  A current account deficit, on the other hand, signifies that a country is spending more on imports than it earns from exports and other receipts.  Understanding the difference between a surplus and a deficit is essential for interpreting a country's BoP.


**9. With reference to Stablecoins, consider the following statements:**

1. Stablecoins are inherently volatile digital assets designed to mirror the price fluctuations of Bitcoin.
2. Stablecoins primarily aim to replace traditional banking systems, providing a complete alternative to fiat currencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, unlike Bitcoin which is highly volatile. They achieve this stability by pegging their value to an underlying asset, such as a fiat currency (like the US dollar), a commodity (like gold), or a basket of other cryptocurrencies.  Their aim is to reduce volatility, not to mirror it. The stability of stablecoins is their key differentiating feature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While stablecoins offer a less volatile alternative within the crypto market, their primary purpose is not to replace traditional banking systems.  They primarily serve as a bridge between the crypto world and the traditional financial system, providing a more stable digital asset for transactions and as a store of value within the crypto ecosystem. The coexistence of stablecoins and traditional banking systems is more likely, rather than a complete replacement.


**10. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS scheme is only applicable to complaints related to commercial banks, excluding other financial institutions.
2. The RB-IOS scheme offers a paid grievance redressal service, charging fees based on the complexity of the complaint.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS scheme covers a wide range of regulated entities beyond just commercial banks.  It includes regional rural banks, scheduled and non-scheduled primary (urban) cooperative banks (meeting specific criteria), non-banking financial companies (with certain asset size limits), payment system participants, and credit information companies.  The broad coverage of the scheme is designed to address grievances across the financial sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RB-IOS scheme provides a cost-free redressal of customer complaints.  This accessibility is crucial for ensuring that all customers, regardless of their financial status, can access the scheme for resolving their grievances. The free-of-charge nature of the scheme is an important aspect of its design.

**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's primary regulatory role over card networks stems from the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, designating it as the overseeing authority.
2.  The RBI's surplus profits, not subject to income tax, are transferred to the Union government based on the provisions of Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934, with the amount varying significantly year to year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSS Act, 2007) explicitly designates the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as the primary regulatory authority for payment systems in India, including card networks. This act provides the legal framework for the RBI's oversight and regulation of these systems, ensuring their smooth and secure operation.  The Act's objective is to regulate and supervise payment systems, and the RBI's role is central to this objective.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The RBI, being exempt from income tax, transfers its surplus profits to the Union government as per Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934. The amount transferred fluctuates considerably depending on the RBI's financial performance each fiscal year.  This transfer mechanism reflects the RBI's position as a government institution and its responsibility to contribute to the nation's finances.  The significant year-to-year variation highlights the dynamic nature of the RBI's financial operations and the impact of economic factors on its profitability.


**2. With reference to Cooperative Banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The dual control of Cooperative Banks involves the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulating banking aspects and the Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) overseeing management-related aspects, with the RBI’s jurisdiction extending to all cooperative banks regardless of size.
2.  The NUCFDC, an Umbrella Organisation (UO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), functions as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) and offers liquidity and capital support, aiming to improve economies of scale for smaller UCBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While it's true that Cooperative Banks in India are under the dual control of the RBI and the RCS of respective state or central governments, the RBI's regulatory reach is not universal.  The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Banking Laws (Application to Co-operative Societies) Act, 1965, empower the RBI to regulate banking aspects, but this does not apply to all cooperative banks.  Specifically, Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) and certain other long-term credit co-operatives are excluded from the RBI's purview.  The RCS retains primary regulatory power over these entities.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) acts as an Umbrella Organisation (UO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), functioning as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO).  Its key functions include providing liquidity and capital support to UCBs, particularly smaller ones, to enhance their operational efficiency and economies of scale. This aligns with the RBI's expert committee report (2021) suggesting alternatives to mergers for smaller banks to achieve improved economies of scale.


**3. With reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), consider the following statements:**

1. The LCR, a critical metric for banks, measures a bank's ability to meet short-term liquidity needs during a crisis by mandating that banks hold a minimum of 100% High-quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) relative to their short-term liabilities.
2.  Recent RBI proposals aim to tighten the LCR by increasing the mandated percentage of HQLA to a range between 113% and 116%, effective from April 1, 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the LCR does measure a bank's short-term liquidity resilience during crises and mandates holding High-quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), the minimum requirement is not 100%.  The LCR aims to ensure banks have sufficient liquid assets to cover their short-term liabilities during a stress scenario.  The exact percentage varies depending on regulatory frameworks and is not a fixed 100%.  A figure of 100% is merely a goal, not a strict legal minimum.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI has recently proposed adjustments to the LCR, aiming to tighten liquidity requirements for banks.  These proposals intend to reduce the LCR to a range between 113% and 116%, representing a tightening of the ratio and potentially influencing banks' liquidity management strategies. This move is likely intended to enhance financial stability and mitigate risks associated with short-term liquidity shortages.  The proposed effective date of April 1, 2025, indicates a phased implementation.


**4. With reference to the National Pension System (NPS) Trust, consider the following statements:**

1. The NPS Trust, created by the PFRDA under the Indian Trusts Act of 1882, is an intermediary responsible for managing NPS funds, with its governance structure strictly adhering to the Companies Act, 2013.
2. Recent amendments to the NPS regulations increased compliance requirements for pension funds, including enhanced disclosures and the implementation of fraud prevention policies by Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NPS Trust was indeed created by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) under the Indian Trusts Act of 1882, and it does act as an intermediary managing NPS funds, its governance structure doesn't solely follow the Companies Act, 2013.  The governance structure of the Trust is a blend of the Indian Trusts Act and specific regulations set by the PFRDA.  The statement oversimplifies the complex governance framework.

Statement 2 is correct. Recent amendments to the National Pension System (NPS) regulations have introduced stricter compliance requirements for pension funds.  These include a greater emphasis on transparency through enhanced disclosures, along with the implementation of robust fraud prevention and mitigation policies by the Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs).  These measures aim to strengthen the integrity and security of the NPS system.


**5. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID, established in 2021 by an Act of Parliament, is a specialized Development Finance Institution (DFI) regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI).
2.  NaBFID's objective is to address gaps in long-term non-recourse finance for infrastructure development and to strengthen the development of bonds and derivatives markets in India, with its shareholding exclusively held by the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NaBFID was indeed established in 2021 by an Act of Parliament and is a specialized DFI aimed at bolstering India's infrastructure sector.  However, it is *not* regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).  Its regulatory oversight comes from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI), under sections 45L and 45N of the RBI Act, 1934.  The statement incorrectly attributes regulatory responsibility to SEBI.

Statement 2 is correct.  NaBFID's primary objectives are to bridge the funding gap for long-term, non-recourse infrastructure financing and to foster the growth of India's bond and derivatives markets.  Currently, the entire shareholding of NaBFID is held by the Government of India, though the NaBFID Act allows for participation from other entities like multilateral institutions and sovereign wealth funds.  The statement accurately reflects NaBFID's core mandate and current shareholding structure.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the  Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) 2024:**

1.  The UCPMP 2024, issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, mandates that all promotional material for pharmaceuticals must be pre-approved by a designated government body before release.
2. The code prohibits the use of brand names of competing pharmaceutical products in promotional material without prior consent, and comparisons between drugs must be factual, fair, and verifiable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UCPMP 2024, issued by the Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers (and not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare),  sets stringent guidelines for pharmaceutical marketing, it does *not* mandate pre-approval of all promotional materials by a government body. The code focuses on ensuring the information provided is balanced, accurate, and does not mislead consumers.  The statement misrepresents the regulatory approach by implying a mandatory pre-approval process for all promotional materials.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UCPMP 2024 explicitly prohibits the unauthorized use of competing pharmaceutical brands in promotional materials.  Furthermore, it mandates that any comparisons made between drugs must be factually accurate, fair, and supported by verifiable evidence.  This provision aims to prevent misleading or deceptive marketing practices in the pharmaceutical sector and promotes fair competition.


**7. With reference to the  Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (ICRR), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICRR, a tool used by the RBI to manage liquidity, is a percentage of a bank's total assets that must be maintained with the RBI as liquid cash reserves, earning interest at a rate determined by the RBI.
2. The implementation of ICRR can lead to decreased lending by banks, potentially impacting aggregate demand and inflation in the economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICRR is not calculated as a percentage of a bank's total assets.  It's applied to a bank's Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL), representing the difference between a bank's total liabilities and certain assets.  Furthermore, banks do *not* earn interest on the funds maintained under the ICRR; it's a tool to absorb excess liquidity.  The statement incorrectly defines the base for ICRR calculation and the interest earned.

Statement 2 is correct.  The imposition of ICRR reduces the amount of money banks have available for lending. This reduction in lending capacity can have a ripple effect on the economy, potentially lowering aggregate demand and exerting downward pressure on inflation.  This is a key mechanism through which the ICRR helps to control inflation and manage overall liquidity in the financial system.  The statement accurately reflects the macroeconomic impact of ICRR.


**8. With reference to the  London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition, consider the following statements:**

1. The global transition away from LIBOR was initiated by the Indian government in 2017 due to concerns about manipulation of the benchmark interest rate by some major international banks.
2. The RBI has advised banks to incorporate fallback clauses in all remaining LIBOR-referenced contracts to ensure a smooth transition and maintain transparency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The decision to phase out LIBOR was not initiated by the Indian government.  It was the British financial authorities who, in 2017, decided to phase out LIBOR after discovering evidence of manipulation of the benchmark interest rate by several major international banks.  The Indian government and RBI subsequently responded to this global initiative. The statement wrongly attributes the initiation of the LIBOR transition to the Indian government.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI has indeed issued advisories to banks and other regulated entities urging them to include fallback clauses in all remaining contracts that reference LIBOR.  These fallback clauses are crucial for ensuring a seamless transition to alternative reference rates and for maintaining transparency and consistency in financial transactions.  The statement accurately reflects the RBI's proactive approach to managing the LIBOR transition in India.



**9. With reference to the  Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPI, developed by the RBI in 2016, enables users to link multiple bank accounts to a single mobile application, facilitating fund transfers and other banking functions.
2.  Recent RBI regulations have increased the transaction limit for UPI payments for hospitals and educational institutions to ₹5 lakh, while maintaining a general limit of ₹1 lakh for most other categories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the UPI does allow users to link multiple bank accounts to a single mobile application, simplifying fund transfers and other banking services, it was *not* developed by the RBI.  It was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016, building upon the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) infrastructure. The statement incorrectly attributes the development of UPI to the RBI.

Statement 2 is correct.  Recent RBI regulations have indeed raised the transaction limit for UPI payments in specific sectors, such as hospitals and educational institutions, to ₹5 lakh.  This increase aims to facilitate larger transactions in these sectors.  The general transaction limit for most other categories remains capped at ₹1 lakh, with some exceptions.  The statement accurately describes the recent changes in UPI transaction limits.



**10. With reference to the  National Insurance Academy (NIA) report on the Indian insurance landscape, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIA report highlighted a significant Health Protection Gap (HPG) of approximately 73%, indicating that a majority of the Indian population lacks adequate health insurance coverage, with the Life Insurance Protection Gap (IPG) being significantly lower.
2. The report also revealed a high Mortality Protection Gap (MPG), exceeding 90% in certain age groups, and a low penetration of natural catastrophe insurance coverage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NIA report did highlight a substantial Health Protection Gap (HPG) of approximately 73%, reflecting inadequate health insurance coverage for a large segment of the population. However, the Life Insurance Protection Gap (IPG) is also very high according to the report and is not significantly lower than the HPG. The statement misrepresents the relative magnitudes of the HPG and IPG.

Statement 2 is correct. The NIA report did indeed reveal a high Mortality Protection Gap (MPG), exceeding 90% in specific age demographics, reflecting insufficient life insurance coverage in these groups.  Moreover, the report also pointed out the very low penetration of natural catastrophe insurance in India, indicating a significant vulnerability to such events. The statement accurately summarizes key findings of the report regarding life insurance and disaster coverage.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1.  The UPSC's recommendations regarding the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner are binding on the President of India.
2.  The President of India appoints all members of the UPSC, including the Chairman, without any consultation with other bodies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UPSC does recommend candidates for the post of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), the President of India ultimately makes the appointment.  The President’s decision is not bound by the UPSC's recommendation. The President has the discretion to accept or reject the recommendation. This reflects the President's role as the head of state and the independent nature of the Election Commission.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The President of India appoints the Chairman and members of the UPSC, but this appointment is not made solely at the President's discretion.  The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet advises the President on these appointments, signifying a degree of collective executive involvement in the process.  Therefore, the President does not act independently in this matter.  The consultation process ensures transparency and accountability in the selection of individuals for such crucial constitutional positions.


**2. With reference to Money Bills in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill, once passed by the Lok Sabha, automatically becomes law even without the Rajya Sabha's concurrence.
2.  The Rajya Sabha can amend a Money Bill and return it to the Lok Sabha for reconsideration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A Money Bill, after being passed by the Lok Sabha, is sent to the Rajya Sabha for its recommendations. However, the Rajya Sabha's power is limited to recommending amendments within 14 days of receiving the bill.  The Lok Sabha is not bound to accept these recommendations.  If the Rajya Sabha fails to return the bill within 14 days or if the Lok Sabha rejects the recommendations, the Money Bill is deemed passed by both Houses and is presented to the President for assent, effectively bypassing the Rajya Sabha's power of veto. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary role in financial matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to amend a Money Bill. Its role is restricted to offering recommendations, which the Lok Sabha may choose to accept or reject. The Rajya Sabha cannot veto or significantly alter a Money Bill. This constitutional arrangement underscores the Lok Sabha's dominance in matters of finance.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the Lok Sabha:**

1. The Lok Sabha's term can be extended beyond five years only during a period of national emergency, and such extension must be approved by a special majority in the Lok Sabha itself.
2.  The President of India can dissolve the Lok Sabha at any time, without the need for any recommendation from the Prime Minister or the Council of Ministers.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Lok Sabha's term can be extended beyond five years only during a state of national emergency declared under Article 352 of the Constitution.  However, this extension is not contingent upon the Lok Sabha’s approval by a special majority.  The extension is a consequence of the emergency declaration itself, and the Lok Sabha's continued functioning during this period is a constitutional necessity. The President's decision to extend the term is final.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha, this power is not exercised arbitrarily. The President typically acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, who, in a parliamentary system, needs the support of the Lok Sabha to govern.  Dissolving the Lok Sabha without the Prime Minister's advice would be a breach of constitutional conventions. Therefore, the President’s decision is usually in agreement with the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, reflecting the principles of responsible governance in a parliamentary democracy.


**4. With reference to the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor can pardon a death sentence without the need for any consultation with the President of India.
2.  The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President, and can be removed by the President at any time.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Governor possesses pardoning powers under Article 161 of the Constitution, similar to the President's powers under Article 72,  the Governor cannot pardon a death sentence. Only the President holds the power to pardon a death sentence. This distinction reflects the gravity of the death penalty and the need for a higher level of executive authority in such matters.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President of India.  This means the President can remove the Governor at any time, without assigning any reason.  This provision reflects the Centre's ultimate authority over the states, maintaining the unity and integrity of the nation.  Although the removal is technically discretionary, it is generally done only on grounds of serious misconduct or gross negligence.  This mechanism ensures accountability of the state executive to the Union government.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Finance Commission of India:**

1.  The Finance Commission is a constitutional body whose members are appointed by the Prime Minister of India.
2.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State Governments.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission is a constitutional body established under Article 280 of the Constitution. However, its members are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  The President's role in this appointment highlights the independent and impartial nature of the Finance Commission. The President usually acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, but this does not diminish the significance of the presidential involvement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations are not legally binding on the Union and State Governments.  They are, however, highly influential and generally followed by both levels of government.  The non-binding nature of recommendations allows for flexibility and the incorporation of other relevant considerations while formulating fiscal policies. The government can deviate from the recommendations but must provide reasons for doing so. This balances the importance of expert advice with the government’s autonomy in financial matters.


**6. With reference to the Law Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Law Commission is a constitutional body established under Part XIV of the Constitution of India.
2.  The Law Commission's reports are legally binding on the Parliament and the Government of India.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Law Commission of India is not a constitutional body. It is a non-statutory body constituted by the Government of India from time to time by a resolution of the Ministry of Law and Justice.  Its constitution is not mentioned in the Constitution, reflecting the government's flexibility in determining its structure and mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Law Commission's reports are not legally binding on the Parliament or the Government of India. However, they carry significant weight and influence lawmaking and policy formulation.  The non-binding nature allows the government to consider the reports in conjunction with other factors before making final decisions.  This arrangement ensures that the government retains the ultimate authority in law-making while benefiting from the Law Commission's expertise and recommendations.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the National Green Tribunal (NGT):**

1. The NGT is a constitutional body established under Part IX-A of the Constitution of India.
2. The NGT has the powers of a civil court while trying cases related to environmental protection and conservation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is not a constitutional body. It was established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, a statutory body, not a constitutional one. Its creation is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  This approach allows for more flexibility in adapting the Tribunal's structure and jurisdiction to evolving environmental concerns.

Statement 2 is correct. The NGT possesses the powers of a civil court while trying cases related to environmental protection and conservation. This includes the power to summon witnesses, examine evidence, and issue orders for remediation and compensation.  Granting such powers to the NGT ensures its effectiveness in addressing environmental violations and promoting environmental justice.  The broad powers of the NGT are crucial for the implementation of environmental laws and regulations.


**8. With reference to the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPA is a constitutional body established under Part IX-B of the Constitution of India.
2.  The CCPA is empowered to conduct investigations into unfair trade practices and misleading advertisements.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) is not a constitutional body.  It is a statutory body established under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.  Its establishment is not enshrined in the Constitution, allowing the government to modify its structure and responsibilities as per changing consumer needs and market dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct. The CCPA is indeed empowered to conduct investigations into unfair trade practices and misleading advertisements.  It has broad investigative and enforcement powers to protect consumer rights and ensure fair market practices.  These powers are crucial for safeguarding consumer interests and preventing businesses from engaging in deceptive or exploitative practices.  The CCPA's mandate reflects the growing emphasis on consumer protection and market regulation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Right to Information Act, 2005, mandates imprisonment as the sole penalty for non-compliance with its provisions.
2. The Department of Personnel and Training is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the Central Information Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Right to Information Act, 2005, provides for a range of penalties for non-compliance, including fines and imprisonment, depending on the severity of the violation.  Imprisonment is not the *sole* penalty. The Act allows for a flexible approach to enforcement, enabling the Information Commissions to tailor penalties to the specific circumstances of each case. This reflects the nuanced nature of information disclosure and the need for proportionate responses to varying degrees of non-compliance.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) plays a crucial role in the overall administration of the RTI Act,  it doesn't directly manage the day-to-day functioning of the Central Information Commission (CIC).  The CIC is an independent body responsible for its own operations. The DoPT's role is more supervisory and related to policy and resource allocation.  The distinction between oversight and direct management is key to understanding the autonomy of the CIC.


**2. With reference to the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President's power to grant pardons extends to offenses under State laws but excludes those under Union laws.
2.  The President's emoluments are determined by the Supreme Court of India and are subject to judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's pardon power, as defined in Article 72 of the Constitution, extends to punishments or sentences awarded by any court, tribunal, or authority within India, including those under both Union and State laws.  There is no such limitation specified in the Constitution.  The President's power in this area is broad and encompasses a wide range of offenses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's emoluments are fixed by Parliament, not the Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court can review actions of the government concerning the President, the determination of the President's salary is a legislative matter under the purview of Parliament.  The emoluments are not subject to judicial review in the sense of being challenged in court regarding their actual amount.


**3. With reference to Money Bills, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Rajya Sabha by a Minister, following the President's recommendation.
2.  The Rajya Sabha's power to make recommendations on a Money Bill is limited to a period of 14 days.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. This is a fundamental aspect of the Indian parliamentary system's structure, designed to ensure the Lok Sabha's primary control over financial matters. The President's recommendation is required, but the introduction is exclusively in the Lok Sabha.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations on a Money Bill and must return it to the Lok Sabha within 14 days.  This limited timeframe reflects the Rajya Sabha's subordinate role in financial legislation, ensuring that the legislative process regarding Money Bills does not get unduly delayed.  The 14-day limit is crucial for the timely passage of essential financial legislation.


**4. With reference to the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), consider the following statements:**

1. The Vice-Chairperson of NITI Aayog is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years.
2. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, which was established in 1950.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vice-Chairperson of NITI Aayog is appointed by the Prime Minister, not the President. The Prime Minister's role reflects the executive nature of the appointment and the government's direct control over NITI Aayog's leadership. The term is not fixed at five years, but it is co-terminus with the government's term.

Statement 2 is correct.  NITI Aayog was formed to replace the Planning Commission, which was indeed established in 1950. This change represented a shift in India's approach to economic planning, moving from a centralized, command-economy model to a more cooperative and decentralized one. The replacement signified a major policy shift.


**5. With reference to the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTs are constitutional bodies established under Article 323A of the Indian Constitution.
2. The FTs’ powers include summoning witnesses and examining them under oath.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) are not constitutional bodies. They were established through the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, under the Foreigners Act, 1946.  They are statutory bodies, not established by the Constitution.  The difference between constitutional and statutory bodies is critical in understanding their powers and limitations.

Statement 2 is correct. FTs possess quasi-judicial powers, including the authority to summon and examine witnesses under oath, to ensure a fair and thorough process for determining the citizenship status of individuals. This power is essential for their function in resolving complex cases related to citizenship.


**6. With reference to the Scheduled Caste list, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 341 of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to make changes to the Scheduled Caste list.
2.  Once notified by the President, changes to the Scheduled Caste list can only be made through a Constitutional Amendment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the President initially specifies the Scheduled Castes under Article 341, Parliament has the power to amend the list through legislation. This reflects the dynamic nature of social classifications and the need for flexibility in addressing evolving social realities. The legislative process ensures a transparent and accountable method for making changes to the list.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Changes to the Scheduled Caste list require parliamentary legislation, not a Constitutional Amendment.  A Constitutional Amendment is a far more significant process and is not necessary for changes to the list of Scheduled Castes.  The use of parliamentary legislation reflects the balance between the need for flexibility and the preservation of the Constitution's core structure.


**7. With reference to the Governor's powers regarding Bills, consider the following statements:**

1. If a Governor reserves a Bill for the President's consideration, the President is bound to either give assent or return the Bill for reconsideration.
2. A Governor can withhold assent to a Bill passed by the State Legislature, effectively preventing it from becoming law.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the President can withhold assent to a reserved bill, they cannot return it for reconsideration. The President's decision is final in this regard. This reflects the President's ultimate authority in such matters.  The power to withhold assent is a significant check on state legislative power, but the lack of power to return the bill for reconsideration limits the President's role to a straightforward approval or rejection.

Statement 2 is correct.  A Governor has the power to withhold assent to a Bill, preventing it from becoming law. This power acts as a check and balance within the state's legislative process, enabling the Governor to review legislation before it becomes law. However, the Governor's power is not absolute and is subject to certain constitutional limitations and conventions.



**8.  With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC Chairman and members are appointed by the Prime Minister for a term of six years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2.  The UPSC conducts the civil services examination to select officers for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), the Indian Foreign Service (IFS), and the Indian Police Service (IPS), among others.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India, not the Prime Minister. This reflects the constitutional position of the UPSC and its independence from the executive branch of government. The appointment process emphasizes the importance of an independent and impartial selection process for the Commission. The term is six years or until 65, whichever is earlier.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UPSC is responsible for conducting the civil services examination, a crucial process for selecting officers for the All India Services (IAS, IPS, IFS) and other central services.  The examination's importance in recruiting high-quality civil servants for the Indian government is widely recognized.  The UPSC's role underlines its importance in maintaining the quality and integrity of the civil services.


**9. With reference to the Right to Education Act, 2009, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates free and compulsory education for children between the ages of 6 and 18 years.
2. Article 21A of the Constitution, inserted by the 86th Amendment Act, 2002, forms the basis of the RTE Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTE Act mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14 years, not 6 to 18. The age range reflects the focus on providing basic education to children during their formative years.  The difference between these age ranges is significant in understanding the scope and limitations of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 21A, inserted by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002, guarantees the Right to Education, providing the constitutional basis for the RTE Act, 2009. This constitutional backing underscores the importance of education as a fundamental right in India. The Amendment Act provides the legal foundation for the RTE Act, which operationalizes this right.


**10. With reference to the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act decriminalizes over 200 provisions across 50 laws.
2. The Act introduces a mechanism for periodic revision of fines and penalties for various offenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Jan Vishwas Act significantly decriminalizes provisions, the number is 183, not over 200. The precise number is important in gauging the extent of the decriminalization effort. However, the substantial reduction in criminal offenses is a key feature of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act does indeed introduce a mechanism for periodic revision of fines and penalties, increasing the minimum amount by 10% every three years. This provision aims to ensure that penalties remain relevant and effective over time. The periodic review mechanism demonstrates a commitment to adapting the legal framework to changing circumstances.


**11. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG is appointed by the Prime Minister of India.
2. The CAG audits the accounts of the Union and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG is appointed by the President of India. The presidential appointment underscores the independence and constitutional status of the CAG.  The appointment process is designed to ensure the CAG's impartiality and objectivity.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG audits the accounts of both the Union and State Governments to ensure transparency and accountability in public finances.  The CAG's audit function is a crucial element of India's system of checks and balances.  The scope of the audit includes a vast range of government spending and activities.


**12. With reference to the powers of the President and Governor to promulgate Ordinances, consider the following statements:**

1. An ordinance promulgated by the Governor ceases to operate after six months from the commencement of the next session of the State Legislature.
2. A Governor can promulgate an ordinance on any matter on which the State Legislature can make laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  An ordinance promulgated by the Governor (or President) ceases to operate after six weeks, not six months, from the commencement of the next session of the State Legislature (or Parliament). The six-week time limit is a critical aspect of the ordinance-making power, designed to ensure that temporary laws do not remain in effect indefinitely.

Statement 2 is correct.  A Governor can indeed promulgate an ordinance on any matter on which the State Legislature has the power to make laws.  This power, however, is subject to certain restrictions and is intended for use only when the Legislature is not in session.  The limitations on the ordinance-making power are important to understand the scope of this emergency legislative mechanism.


**13. With reference to the Secretariat of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recruitment and conditions of service of the Lok Sabha Secretariat staff are governed by a law passed by Parliament.
2. The Secretary-Generals of both Houses of Parliament hold ranks equivalent to that of the Cabinet Secretary and are placed at the same position in the table of precedence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Parliament has the power to regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of the secretarial staff of both Houses, no such law has been enacted thus far.  The absence of such a law is a significant feature of the current system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Secretary-Generals of both houses hold ranks equivalent to the Cabinet Secretary, they are not placed at the same position in the table of precedence. The Cabinet Secretary holds a higher position. The difference in precedence reflects the differing roles and responsibilities within the governmental hierarchy.


**14. With reference to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd Amendment Act added Part IX-A to the Constitution, dealing with urban local governments.
2. The 74th Amendment Act added the 12th Schedule to the Constitution, listing the functional items of municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd Amendment Act added Part IX to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayati Raj Institutions.  Part IX-A, dealing with urban local governments, was added by the 74th Amendment Act. The distinction between these two parts is crucial to understanding the scope of each Amendment.

Statement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act indeed added the 12th Schedule to the Constitution, listing the functional items of municipalities.  The 12th Schedule details the functions of urban local bodies, providing a framework for their operation.


**15. With reference to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIS was established under the BIS Act, 2016, replacing the Indian Standards Institution (ISI).
2. The Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution acts as the Vice-President of the BIS Governing Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The BIS was initially established under the BIS Act, 1986, replacing the ISI.  The BIS Act, 2016, was a subsequent restructuring, not the original establishment. The difference in years is significant in understanding the evolution of the BIS.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution acts as the *President*, not the Vice-President, of the BIS Governing Council. The President's role reflects the government's oversight of the BIS.  The distinction between President and Vice-President reflects the power structure within the BIS's governing body.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a "difficult" level by employing misleading information and plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  A Money Bill, once passed by the Lok Sabha, is automatically deemed passed by the Rajya Sabha after 14 days, even without its concurrence.
2. The President of India can return a Money Bill to the Parliament for reconsideration if he/she finds it constitutionally problematic.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A Money Bill, after being passed by the Lok Sabha, is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations within 14 days; it cannot reject or amend the bill.  After the 14-day period, the bill is deemed passed by both houses, even if the Rajya Sabha hasn't explicitly agreed. This reflects the Lok Sabha's primary power over financial matters.  The power of the Rajya Sabha is restricted to only offering suggestions, not rejecting or altering the bill.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's power regarding Money Bills is limited to either giving assent or withholding assent. The President *cannot* return the bill to the Parliament for reconsideration. This is a crucial aspect of the Money Bill's legislative process, designed to prevent delays in crucial financial legislation. The President's role is purely one of assent or rejection, not of amendment or return for reconsideration.  This is a significant difference between Money Bills and other types of bills.


**2. With reference to the powers of the Governor of a State, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor can promulgate an ordinance even if the State Legislative Assembly is in session, provided the President of India gives prior consent.
2.  A bill passed by the State Legislature automatically becomes law upon the Governor's signature, regardless of its content or potential constitutional issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Governor's power to promulgate ordinances is specifically limited to situations where the State Legislature is *not* in session.  While the President's consent might be required in specific circumstances (like those affecting the powers of the High Court), the Legislature being in session inherently negates the need for an ordinance. Ordinances are meant to address urgent matters when the legislature is not functioning, and not a routine legislative tool.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Governor's assent is necessary for a bill to become law, but it's not automatic or unconditional. The Governor has several options: giving assent, withholding assent, returning the bill for reconsideration, or reserving it for the President's consideration. The Governor's decision is influenced by the bill's content and can be challenged if it is deemed unconstitutional. The Governor's power is not absolute; there are checks and balances in place.


**3. With reference to Lok Adalats, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lok Adalats can adjudicate on all types of civil and criminal cases, including those involving non-compoundable offences.
2. The awards (decisions) of Lok Adalats are final and binding, with no provision for appeal to any court of law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Adalats primarily aim for amicable settlements. While they can handle both civil and criminal matters (within the jurisdiction of the court they are established under), they *cannot* deal with non-compoundable offenses. These are offenses where the parties cannot reach a compromise without court intervention, requiring a judicial determination. Lok Adalats are designed to resolve disputes through compromise, and the nature of non-compoundable offenses prevents this.

Statement 2 is correct.  The awards of Lok Adalats are indeed deemed final and binding under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.  There is no avenue for an appeal against a Lok Adalat's decision. However, if parties remain dissatisfied, they retain the right to initiate fresh litigation in the appropriate court. The finality of Lok Adalat decisions is a key feature of this alternative dispute resolution mechanism, designed to promote efficiency and speed in resolving cases.


**4. With reference to the Tribunal System in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 42nd Constitutional Amendment of 1976 introduced the concept of tribunals, completely replacing the existing judicial system for certain specified matters.
2. The Supreme Court's 2010 ruling restricted the creation of tribunals to only those subject matters explicitly listed under Article 323B.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 introduced the term "tribunal" and Articles 323A and 323B into the Constitution, enabling the creation of tribunals. However, it did *not* replace the existing judicial system. Tribunals were introduced as an alternative mechanism to address specific types of disputes, primarily administrative in nature, to reduce the burden on the regular courts.  The judicial system continues to operate alongside the tribunal system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2010 clarification actually broadened, not restricted, the scope of tribunal creation.  It stated that the subject matters under Article 323B are not exclusive; legislatures can establish tribunals on any subject within their purview (as defined in the Seventh Schedule).  This decision increased the legislative flexibility in establishing tribunals.


**5. With reference to the Ordinance-making power of the President and Governor, consider the following statements:**

1.  An ordinance promulgated by the Governor of a State remains in effect indefinitely unless explicitly revoked.
2. The President can issue an ordinance on any subject, irrespective of whether Parliament has the power to legislate on that subject.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ordinances, whether issued by the President or Governor, are temporary laws. They cease to operate after six weeks from the commencement of the next session of the Parliament or State Legislature, whichever is later. They can also lapse earlier if withdrawn by the President/Governor or if disapproved by a resolution of the legislature.  The temporary nature of ordinances is a critical aspect of this legislative tool, preventing the bypassing of the regular legislative process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Both the President and Governor can only issue ordinances on matters on which the Parliament or State Legislature respectively has the power to make laws.  The ordinance-making power is not a carte blanche to legislate on any subject; it remains subject to the same constitutional limitations as the regular legislative process.  This is a key constraint on the use of ordinances, preventing arbitrary legislative action.


**6. With reference to the Law Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Law Commission of India is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament, and its recommendations are legally binding.
2. The Law Commission's primary role is to proactively identify and propose legal reforms, rather than merely reacting to existing issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Law Commission of India is a *non-statutory* body constituted by the Government of India. Its recommendations are advisory in nature and are not legally binding.  The government can choose to accept or reject the Commission's recommendations.  The non-binding nature of the recommendations allows for flexibility and consideration of diverse viewpoints in the law-making process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Law Commission primarily recommends reforms in existing laws, making its role largely *reactive*. While it might identify areas needing reform, its primary function is to respond to requests for legal changes and propose improvements to existing legislation. Its recommendations are based on detailed analysis and consultations but are not binding.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX-A to the Constitution, dealing with Panchayati Raj Institutions.
2.  The 12th Schedule to the Constitution, added by the 74th Amendment Act of 1992, lists the functional items for Municipalities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 73rd Amendment Act, 1992, indeed added Part IX to the Constitution, which deals with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). This part contains Articles 243 to 243O. This constitutionalization of PRIs was a major step in decentralizing power in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act of 1992 added Part IX-A to the Constitution, which pertains to the constitutionalization of urban local governments.  Additionally, it added the 12th Schedule, listing the 18 functional items of Municipalities.  This amendment aimed to strengthen urban local governance across India.  The 12th Schedule provides the functional items of Municipalities, thereby outlining the scope of their powers and responsibilities.


**8. With reference to the Centre-State relations in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor of a State can withhold assent to a bill passed by the State Legislature indefinitely.
2.  The President of India can direct the Governor to return a bill passed by the State Legislature for reconsideration, even if the bill does not concern matters requiring Presidential sanction.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Governor can withhold assent to a bill, it’s not indefinite. If the State Legislature re-passes the bill in its original or a modified form, the Governor *must* give assent.  The Governor's power to withhold assent is not absolute and is subject to checks and balances.  This ensures that the legislative process is not unduly obstructed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President can direct the Governor to return a bill only in specific situations, mainly when the bill needs prior Presidential sanction for introduction or when the Governor has reserved the bill for Presidential consideration. The President does not have general authority to intervene in the State Legislature’s legislative process.  The President's power is limited to those matters explicitly reserved for their consideration.


**9. With reference to Cooperative Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 7th Schedule of the Constitution establishes a system of exclusive jurisdiction, where either the Centre or the States have sole authority over their respective lists of subjects.
2. The Inter-State Council, established under Article 263, has the power to make legally binding decisions to resolve disputes between States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 7th Schedule, while dividing subjects between the Centre and States, also includes a Concurrent List.  Subjects on the Concurrent List are under the jurisdiction of both, with the central laws prevailing in case of conflict.  The principle of cooperative federalism encourages joint action, not strictly exclusive jurisdiction. The division of power is not absolute, acknowledging the need for coordinated action between the Centre and States.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Inter-State Council's role is primarily advisory.  It investigates and discusses subjects of common interest and makes recommendations, but its decisions are not legally binding. The Council promotes cooperation and coordination, but the final decision-making power rests with the respective legislative bodies. The advisory nature of the Council’s role ensures that its recommendations consider diverse perspectives.


**10. With reference to Inter-State Water Disputes in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Entry 17 of the State List in the Seventh Schedule grants exclusive jurisdiction to State Governments over all matters related to water resources within their territory.
2.  Article 262 of the Constitution completely bars the Supreme Court from adjudicating on any inter-state river water disputes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Entry 17 of the State List grants States power over water resources, but this is subject to Entry 56 of the Union List, which allows the Centre to legislate on the regulation and development of inter-state rivers and river valleys. This reflects the shared nature of water resources, recognizing the need for both state and central level governance.  The concurrent jurisdiction acknowledges the inter-state nature of many water bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 262 generally prevents the Supreme Court from adjudicating inter-state river water disputes, it doesn't create an absolute bar.  Article 136 allows the Supreme Court to hear appeals against tribunal orders on such disputes.  This exception ensures that the Supreme Court can intervene if there are substantial legal issues with the decisions of water disputes tribunals.  This provision acts as a check on the decisions made by the tribunals.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the geographical features of the Ganges River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ganges River's principal source is the Bhagirathi River, originating from the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas.
2. The confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers creates the Sunderbans delta, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its unique mangrove ecosystem.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Ganges River system is complex, with multiple headstreams, the Bhagirathi River, originating from the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas, is widely considered the main source of the Ganges.  The other headstream, the Alaknanda, joins the Bhagirathi to form the Ganges.  The statement accurately reflects this key geographical fact.

Statement 2 is also correct. The confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, along with other rivers, forms the vast Sunderbans delta, a unique ecosystem renowned for its mangrove forests and rich biodiversity.  Its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site underscores its global ecological significance.  The statement accurately connects the confluence to the delta and its heritage status.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are factually accurate. Option (d) is incorrect as it contradicts the established geographical facts about the Ganges River system.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Arabian Sea:**

1. The Arabian Sea receives significantly less rainfall compared to the Bay of Bengal due to the influence of the monsoon winds.
2. The Narmada River, one of the major west-flowing peninsular rivers of India, drains into the Arabian Sea, contributing significantly to its water volume.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The monsoon winds play a crucial role in determining rainfall patterns in the Indian subcontinent. The Bay of Bengal receives substantially higher rainfall than the Arabian Sea during the southwest monsoon season. This difference is primarily due to the orographic effect of the Western Ghats and the direction of the monsoon winds, which bring more moisture to the Bay of Bengal.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Narmada River is a significant west-flowing river in peninsular India, and its drainage basin encompasses a large area. The river's eventual confluence with the Arabian Sea contributes substantially to the sea's overall water volume and hydrological characteristics.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements reflect accurate geographical and hydrological information. Option (d) is incorrect as it negates well-established facts about the Arabian Sea's rainfall and river systems.


**3. With reference to the geographical location of the Chagos Islands, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chagos Islands are situated north of the Maldives archipelago, a significant island nation in the Indian Ocean.
2. The UK's claim of sovereignty over the Chagos Islands remains a point of contention between the UK and Mauritius, leading to ongoing diplomatic disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chagos Archipelago is located south of the Maldives, not north. This is a crucial geographical detail that distinguishes the location of these two island groups in the Indian Ocean.  The statement misrepresents their relative positions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chagos Islands' sovereignty is a long-standing point of contention between the UK and Mauritius. Mauritius claims that the UK's detachment of the Chagos Islands before independence was illegal. This dispute has involved international legal proceedings and continues to strain relations between the two nations. The statement accurately reflects the ongoing political and legal struggle. Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is geographically inaccurate. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is factually accurate regarding the ongoing dispute.


**4. With reference to the countries bordering Ivory Coast, consider the following statements:**

1. Liberia and Guinea share a land border with Ivory Coast.
2. Burkina Faso and Ghana are among the countries that do not share a land border with Ivory Coast.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Liberia and Guinea are both direct neighbors of Ivory Coast, sharing land borders with it. This is a straightforward geographical fact easily verifiable on any map of West Africa.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Burkina Faso and Ghana *do* share land borders with Ivory Coast.  This statement presents a false claim about the bordering countries, intending to mislead the examinee. Option (b) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is true.


**5.  With reference to the characteristics of El Niño and La Niña, consider the following statements:**

1. El Niño is characterized by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, leading to significant global climate anomalies.
2. La Niña is associated with cooler-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, often resulting in contrasting climate effects compared to El Niño.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. El Niño is a climate pattern characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This warming disrupts normal atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to significant weather anomalies globally, including changes in rainfall patterns, temperature fluctuations, and increased frequency of extreme weather events.

Statement 2 is also correct. La Niña represents the opposite phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. During La Niña, sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific are cooler than average. This leads to climate effects often opposite to those of El Niño, such as increased rainfall in some regions and droughts in others. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately describe the defining characteristics of El Niño and La Niña. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are correct descriptions of these significant climate patterns.


**6. With reference to the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCZ is a region in the Pacific Ocean known for its abundance of marine mammals such as whales and dolphins.
2. The CCZ is primarily characterized by significant deposits of polymetallic nodules, valuable mineral resources found on the seabed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CCZ does have some marine life, it is not primarily known for its abundance of marine mammals. The statement overemphasizes the presence of marine mammals in the CCZ.

Statement 2 is correct. The Clarion-Clipperton Zone is a vast area in the Pacific Ocean that is particularly rich in polymetallic nodules. These nodules are potato-sized mineral formations containing valuable metals like manganese, cobalt, nickel, and copper.  The significant presence of these mineral resources makes the CCZ a focus of international interest and potential deep-sea mining activities. Option (a) is incorrect as statement 1 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect as statement 2 correctly identifies the primary characteristic of the CCZ.


**7. With reference to rogue waves, consider the following statements:**

1. Rogue waves are unpredictable and can appear twice the height of surrounding waves, posing a significant hazard to ships and coastal structures.
2. The formation of rogue waves is solely attributed to underwater earthquakes, leading to sudden and dramatic changes in sea level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rogue waves are exceptionally large, spontaneous ocean waves that can appear unexpectedly, even in otherwise calm seas. They are known to be significantly higher than surrounding waves, often reaching double their height or even more. These waves pose a considerable threat to ships and coastal infrastructure due to their unpredictable nature and immense power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While underwater earthquakes can generate tsunamis, they are not the sole cause of rogue waves.  Rogue waves can form through various mechanisms, including the constructive interference of multiple wave systems, strong currents, and atmospheric conditions.  Attributing their formation solely to earthquakes is a significant oversimplification. Option (b) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is a correct description of rogue waves.


**8. With reference to the countries sharing borders with Liberia, consider the following statements:**

1. Guinea and Sierra Leone are among the countries that share land borders with Liberia.
2. Mauritania and Burkina Faso are located in a different geographical region and thus do not share land borders with Liberia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Guinea and Sierra Leone are both direct neighbors of Liberia, sharing land borders with it. This is a basic geographical fact.

Statement 2 is also correct. Mauritania and Burkina Faso are situated in a different part of West Africa than Liberia;  they are not geographically close to Liberia and do not share land borders with it.  The statement correctly identifies the geographical separation and lack of border sharing. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are true. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are correct.


**9. With reference to the countries comprising the ‘Lithium Triangle’, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lithium Triangle comprises Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, three South American nations with significant lithium reserves.
2. Brazil, known for its vast natural resources, is also a major part of the Lithium Triangle due to its substantial lithium deposits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Lithium Triangle" is a term used to refer to the region encompassing Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, three South American countries that collectively possess the world's largest reserves of lithium. This concentration of lithium resources in this specific region makes it a crucial area for lithium extraction and global lithium supply chains.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Brazil has abundant natural resources, it is not considered part of the Lithium Triangle. The term specifically denotes the interconnected region of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, characterized by their shared geological formations and high concentration of lithium deposits. The inclusion of Brazil is factually inaccurate. Option (b) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is a correct description of the Lithium Triangle.


**10. With reference to notified disasters in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Disasters declared as 'notified disasters' under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, are eligible for financial assistance from the central government.
2.  Heatwaves have recently been classified as a notified disaster by the Union government, reflecting their increasing severity and impact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, provides a framework for disaster management in India.  Disasters categorized as "notified disasters" under this Act are eligible for financial assistance and other forms of support from the central government to affected states and regions.

Statement 2 is also correct. Recognizing the growing threat posed by heatwaves, the Union government has recently included them in the list of notified disasters. This decision reflects the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves in India, leading to significant loss of life and economic disruption.  The classification as a notified disaster makes heatwave-affected areas eligible for government relief and mitigation efforts.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Disaster Management Act and the recent inclusion of heatwaves as a notified disaster. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are true.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Siang River, known as the Tsangpo in Tibet, originates near Mount Kailash and flows eastward for over 1000 km before entering Arunachal Pradesh.
2.  The Siang River is a major tributary of the Brahmaputra River, joining it in Assam after receiving the Lohit and Dibang rivers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Siang River does originate in Tibet, where it's known as the Yarlung Tsangpo (not just Tsangpo), and it does flow eastward for a considerable distance before entering Arunachal Pradesh. The slight inaccuracy regarding the specific name in Tibet and the precise length doesn't invalidate the core factual accuracy of the statement.  The statement provides a good overview of the river's upper course.

Statement 2 is incorrect in its details. While the Siang River is indeed a major tributary of the Brahmaputra, the assertion that it joins *after* receiving the Lohit and Dibang rivers is misleading. The confluence of the Siang, Dibang and Lohit rivers occurs *before* the combined flow is considered the Brahmaputra River. The order of confluence is crucial geographical detail.  The statement presents an inaccurate sequencing of events impacting the river's course.  Therefore, only statement 1 is substantially correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the origin of the rivers. While the Lohit and Dibang rivers *are* major tributaries of the Brahmaputra, they do not originate in Arunachal Pradesh; their sources lie in the Eastern Himalayas, extending into Tibet. This incorrect detail about their origin makes the statement factually flawed.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Dhansiri River does originate in Nagaland, and it does indeed form a natural boundary between Nagaland and Assam before joining the Brahmaputra River. This statement accurately describes the river's course and its significance as a boundary marker.  Thus, only statement 2 is correct.



**4.  Consider the following statements:**

1. The Yarlung Tsangpo River, after flowing through Tibet, enters India as the Brahmaputra River.
2.  The Siang River is an alternative name for the Brahmaputra River only in its upper reaches in Arunachal Pradesh.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Yarlung Tsangpo River, a major river of Tibet, does indeed enter India and is then known as the Brahmaputra River.  The statement accurately describes a significant aspect of the Brahmaputra's transboundary nature.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Siang is a part of the Brahmaputra River system,  it's specifically recognized as an alternate name for the Brahmaputra in its upper reaches within Arunachal Pradesh. This clarifies that the name "Siang" is regionally specific, not a universal synonym for the entire Brahmaputra.  Both statements are accurate reflections of the river's geographical features and nomenclature.


**5. With reference to the major rivers of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sutlej River, originating near Lake Rakshastal in Tibet, is the easternmost tributary of the Indus River.
2. The Chenab River, a major tributary of the Indus River, receives the Ravi River as its tributary *after* flowing through Jammu and Kashmir.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sutlej River does originate near Lake Rakshastal in Tibet and is considered the easternmost major tributary of the Indus River.  The statement correctly identifies the river's origin and its position within the Indus River system.

Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the confluence point. While the Chenab River is a major tributary of the Indus and does receive the Ravi River, the Ravi joins the Chenab *before* the Chenab flows through the entirety of Jammu and Kashmir.  The statement incorrectly positions the confluence. This subtle inaccuracy makes the statement factually incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Tizu River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tizu River originates in the central part of Nagaland and flows into the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar.

2.  The Pampas, a vast fertile plain, is the location of Argentina's densest rail network, facilitating agricultural trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Argentina's political structure is indeed based on a federal system, mirroring the United States or Canada.  The constitution divides powers between a central government and its constituent provinces, each with its own legislature and executive branches.  This decentralization is a crucial aspect of Argentina's governance. The Pampas region, known for its extensive agricultural production, has historically been a key area for infrastructure development. The dense rail network in the Pampas reflects the historical and ongoing importance of this region in Argentina's economy, particularly in facilitating the transport of agricultural goods to domestic and international markets.  The combination of fertile land and efficient transportation infrastructure has greatly contributed to Argentina's agricultural output and economic development. Therefore, both statements are accurate.


**2. With reference to Argentina's international relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Argentina has signed a significant lithium exploration agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a major Indian defense company.
2.  Argentina's bilateral agreements with India primarily focus on defense collaborations, overlooking economic partnerships.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Argentina and India have strong bilateral relations, including defense cooperation, the lithium exploration agreement is between the governments of Argentina and India, not HAL. HAL might be involved in subsequent projects related to the lithium extraction and processing, but the initial agreement is government-to-government. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. Although Argentina and India do have significant defense collaborations, their bilateral relationship extends considerably to economic partnerships as well.  These economic ties encompass trade, investment, and cooperation in various sectors beyond just defense.  The focus on defense cooperation is significant, but to say it overshadows economic partnerships is an oversimplification of the multifaceted nature of their relationship. The correct statement is that Argentina has a bilateral agreement with India, which includes the exploration of lithium.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chile recently underwent a constitutional reform process culminating in the adoption of a new constitution. This new constitution represents a significant shift from the previous Pinochet-era constitution, introducing changes to governance structures, social rights, and economic policies. The adoption of the new constitution marks a pivotal moment in Chile's political history, altering the fundamental framework of the state. The Atacama Desert is indeed located in northern Chile.  Its extreme aridity is largely due to the rain shadow effect created by the Andes Mountains, which block moisture-bearing winds from the Pacific Ocean.

**1. With reference to the Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (2021), consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme consolidated the Banking Ombudsman Scheme (2006), the Ombudsman Scheme for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) (2018), and the Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions (2019) under a single framework by 2020.
2.  The RBI's primary objective in integrating these schemes was to streamline the complaint resolution process for consumers, improve operational efficiency, and ensure consistent, equitable redressal across all three sectors, while simultaneously reducing the overall cost of operation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (2021) did indeed bring together the three previously separate schemes mentioned, the integration was completed in 2021, not 2020.  The timeline provided in the source material clearly indicates a 2021 launch.  The year 2020 is a distractor designed to test the candidate's attention to detail and precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The source text explicitly states that the RBI aimed to simplify the process for consumers, enhance efficiency, and ensure consistent and fair resolution of complaints. These are the core objectives of integration, aligning with the concept of improved efficiency and equitable redressal.  The mention of cost reduction, while plausible, is not explicitly stated in the source and serves as a potential distractor. The question tests the ability to differentiate between stated objectives and implied benefits.


**2. With reference to the Asmita Project, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Asmita Project aims to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages over *five* years, not ten.  The timeframe is crucial information, deliberately altered to create a misleading statement. The alignment with the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is accurate. The launch year is also a distractor, as the provided text doesn't specify the exact launch date.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UGC is indeed involved in implementing the Asmita Project, the Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti (BBS), not the National Book Trust (NBT), is the other key implementing agency. This substitution of a closely related but incorrect organization highlights the importance of precise knowledge of government bodies and their roles. The focus on promoting multilingualism and accessibility is also accurately reflected in the source text.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), consider the following statements:**

2.  The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is the nodal ministry responsible for the implementation and monitoring of this centrally sponsored scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMGSY was launched in 2000, not 2005. The population thresholds are also incorrect. The scheme aims to connect habitations with populations above 250 in plain areas and 100 in special category states, not 500 and 150 respectively. These numerical discrepancies are deliberate distractors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ministry of Rural Development, and not the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, is the nodal ministry for PMGSY.  This substitution of a closely related ministry tests the candidate's understanding of the organizational structure of the Indian government and the specific responsibilities of each ministry.  The fact that the scheme is centrally sponsored is accurate.


**4.  With reference to the Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana, consider the following statements:**

2. The primary objective of the scheme is to enhance the employability of young people by equipping them with practical work experience and essential skills relevant to the current job market, while promoting inclusive growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The internship duration is six months, not twelve. The age limit is correctly stated as 18-35 years. The stipend amounts are also slightly altered; the actual stipends are ₹6,000, ₹8,000, and ₹10,000.  The changes in numbers serve as effective distractors.

Statement 2 is correct.  The scheme's aim, as stated in the source, is to provide valuable internship opportunities, equip young individuals with essential skills, and enhance their employability. This aligns directly with the statement's description of the scheme's objective. The mention of inclusive growth is a plausible addition that isn't explicitly mentioned but aligns with the general policy goals of such schemes.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While the age range is slightly different (9-18 years in the source, 10-19 years in the statement), the core idea of targeting school children and using sports to curb addiction is accurately reflected. The slight alteration in age range acts as a subtle distractor.

Statement 2 is also correct. The scheme's reliance on modern ICT tools and global best practices for integrated talent identification and its pan-India reach are accurately described.  This statement directly mirrors the information given in the source text.

2.  Recognizing Sikkim's strategic importance due to its proximity to the Siliguri Corridor, the Indian government has implemented several initiatives to enhance the state's infrastructure and tourism sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sikkim became the first Indian state to ban disposable plastic bags in 1998, not 2008, and achieved 100% organic status in 2016, not 2018. The incorrect years are deliberately included to test factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The source text highlights Sikkim's strategic importance due to its proximity to the Siliguri Corridor. While the statement doesn't specify particular initiatives, the underlying idea of infrastructure and tourism development as a consequence of strategic importance is valid and aligns with general government policy.


**7. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. Inaugurated in 2023, iCAL, located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, aims to establish international benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies, serving as a collaborative platform for policymakers, administrators, and auditors.
2.  iCAL will function under the purview of the Ministry of Finance, enhancing the independence of local government auditors to ensure improved financial performance assessment, service delivery, and data reporting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Ahmedabad. The year is also a distractor, as the provided text doesn't specify the inauguration year.  The objective of setting global standards and serving as a collaborative platform is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. iCAL functions out of the office of the Accountant General, under the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, not the Ministry of Finance. This substitution tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian governmental structure and the role of the CAG. The focus on enhancing auditor independence and improving performance is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Union Budget 2024-25, consider the following statements:**

1. The budget proposed a new centrally sponsored scheme with a total outlay of ₹50,000 crore, aiming to skill 15 lakh youth over a five-year period, with a focus on employment generation and support for MSMEs.
2.  The budget increased the standard deduction for salaried employees from ₹50,000 to ₹70,000 and introduced the Purvodaya Plan for the comprehensive development of the eastern region of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The budget proposed a scheme with an outlay of ₹60,000 crore, aiming to skill 20 lakh youth, not 15 lakh. The numbers are deliberately altered to create a distractor. The focus on employment and MSMEs is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The standard deduction was increased to ₹75,000, not ₹70,000.  The Purvodaya Plan is accurately mentioned. The discrepancies in the numerical data create a significant challenge for candidates.

1. Participation in the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission is mandatory for all public and private hospitals, aiming to create a unified digital health ecosystem for seamless portability of health records across India.
2. The mission ensures universal health coverage by mandating participation from every citizen, thereby preserving medical records digitally and preventing their loss.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Participation in the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission is voluntary, not mandatory, for both public and private hospitals. The statement incorrectly asserts mandatory participation. The aim for seamless portability of health records is correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the mission aims for universal health coverage, participation is voluntary for citizens, not mandatory.  The statement falsely claims mandatory participation and universal coverage through mandatory enrollment. The preservation of medical records digitally is a goal, but not achieved through mandatory participation.


**10. With reference to the NIPUN Bharat Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIPUN Bharat Mission, launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, aims to ensure that every child achieves foundational literacy and numeracy skills by the end of Grade 5.
2. The mission's primary goal is to achieve universal Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) among children aged 3-10 years, focusing on reading, writing, and arithmetic skills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NIPUN Bharat Mission is launched by the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The grade level is also incorrect; the target is the end of Grade 3, not Grade 5.

Statement 2 is largely incorrect. The age range is slightly off; the target age group is 3-9 years, not 3-10 years. While the focus on FLN, reading, writing, and basic maths is correct, the minor inaccuracies in age and ministry make the statement incorrect.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI) scheme:**

1. The PM SHRI scheme, a state-sponsored initiative, aims to upgrade over 10,000 existing schools across India to provide high-quality education and infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM SHRI scheme is a *centrally* sponsored scheme, not state-sponsored. The number of schools to be upgraded is also incorrect; it is over 14,500, not 10,000.

Statement 2 is correct.  The statement accurately reflects the scheme's goals of establishing exemplar schools, providing diverse learning experiences, and ensuring access to good physical infrastructure and resources, all in line with NEP 2020.


**12. Consider the following statements about equivalent ranks in the Indian Defence Forces:**

1. The rank of Brigadier in the Army is equivalent to the rank of Commodore in the Navy and Air Commodore in the Air Force.
2. The rank of Lieutenant General in the Army is equivalent to the rank of Admiral in the Navy and Air Chief Marshal in the Air Force.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rank of Brigadier in the Army is equivalent to Commodore in the Navy and Air Commodore in the Air Force.  The statement is inaccurate regarding the Air Force equivalent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rank of Lieutenant General in the Army is equivalent to Vice Admiral in the Navy and Air Marshal in the Air Force. The statement incorrectly gives Admiral and Air Chief Marshal as equivalents.  The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of military ranks.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult'.


**1. With reference to India's economic history, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initial savings rate in India at the time of independence was approximately 10%, primarily driven by agricultural surplus.
2.  The adoption of indicative planning, as opposed to imperative planning, characterized India's economic strategy post-independence, aiming for a mixed economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The initial savings rate in India at independence was significantly lower than 10%, closer to 5%.  This low savings rate was a major constraint on capital formation and economic growth during the early years of independence.  The assertion that it was primarily driven by agricultural surplus is also misleading; while agriculture contributed, the overall savings rate was hampered by low incomes and limited investment opportunities.

Statement 2 is correct. India's post-independence economic strategy was indeed characterized by indicative planning, a system where the government sets broad economic goals and targets, but leaves the actual implementation to the private sector. This contrasted with imperative planning, common in centrally planned economies, where the government directly controls production and resource allocation.  The aim was to foster a mixed economy, combining elements of both the public and private sectors.  This approach was a conscious departure from purely capitalist or socialist models.  The successful implementation of Five Year Plans under this model further substantiates this point, showcasing the government's role in guiding but not dictating economic activity.


**2. With reference to India's foreign policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's "Look East Policy," later evolved into the "Act East Policy," primarily aimed at strengthening economic ties with Southeast Asian countries, while maintaining a non-aligned stance towards the West.
2.  India's participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) primarily focuses on counter-terrorism efforts and regional security, with lesser emphasis on economic cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  India's "Look East Policy," initiated in the early 1990s, and its successor, the "Act East Policy," were indeed designed to enhance economic and strategic engagement with Southeast Asia.  The policies aimed at expanding trade, investment, and connectivity with countries in the region. While India has maintained a non-aligned stance, these policies were also intended to diversify its strategic partnerships and reduce dependence on Western powers. The statement accurately reflects the core objectives of these policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While counter-terrorism and regional security are significant aspects of India's SCO engagement, economic cooperation forms a substantial part of the organization's agenda. The SCO promotes trade, investment, and connectivity among its member states. India actively participates in these economic initiatives within the SCO framework, making the statement's assertion about lesser emphasis on economic cooperation factually inaccurate.


**3. With reference to India's energy sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's proven natural gas reserves in 2018 were significantly higher than its natural gas consumption in the same year, indicating self-sufficiency in natural gas production.
2.  India's commitment to reducing emissions intensity involves a pledge to achieve a 45% reduction by 2030, primarily through a focus on renewable energy sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India possesses natural gas reserves, its consumption in 2018 far exceeded its domestic production.  India is a significant importer of natural gas, highlighting a substantial gap between its reserves and actual energy demand.  The claim of self-sufficiency is therefore inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement include a commitment to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030.  This commitment is largely driven by a focus on increasing the share of renewable energy in its energy mix.  The statement accurately reflects India's stated policy and commitment.


**4. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural export share in the global market in 2023 was approximately 10%, primarily dominated by rice and spices.
2.  India's agricultural R&D expenditure as a percentage of its agricultural GDP is consistently above the global average, demonstrating a strong commitment to technological advancement in agriculture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's agricultural export share is significantly lower than 10%, closer to 2.4%. While rice and spices are important export commodities, the overall share is much smaller due to several factors, including the dominance of other agricultural exporting nations and limitations in the value-added processing of agricultural products.  The statement overestimates India's global share.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While India invests in agricultural R&D, its expenditure as a percentage of its agricultural GDP is considerably lower than the global average.  This limited investment in R&D has implications for improving crop yields and productivity, making the statement's assertion of a strong commitment to technological advancement inaccurate.


**5. With reference to India's defense capabilities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed the Agni-V missile, a long-range ballistic missile,  with a range exceeding 5,000 km, significantly enhancing India's strategic nuclear deterrence.
2.  India's participation in multilateral military exercises like Exercise Malabar demonstrates its commitment to regional security, primarily focusing on countering China's growing naval influence in the Indo-Pacific.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While DRDO did develop Agni-V, the claim that its range exceeds 5000km is a simplification. While its range is indeed significant, the precise figure is classified and not publicly available. This makes the statement inaccurate for a UPSC exam, which expects precise information.  Furthermore, while Agni-V enhances India's nuclear deterrence,  ascribing a specific range to it makes the statement unreliable and potentially misleading.

Statement 2 is largely correct. India’s participation in Exercise Malabar, a joint naval exercise with the US, Japan, and Australia, is a clear demonstration of its commitment to maintaining regional security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.  The exercise enhances interoperability and strengthens strategic partnerships among participating nations. While countering China's influence is a factor, the exercise also focuses on broader aspects of naval cooperation, making the statement's emphasis on countering China a slightly narrow interpretation.


**6. With reference to India's legal framework, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, primarily focuses on preventing money laundering through the financial system, with provisions for stringent enforcement action.
2.  The Right to Information Act, 2005, grants citizens the right to access government information, promoting transparency and accountability, but excludes information related to national security and law enforcement agencies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, is a crucial piece of legislation aimed at tackling money laundering in India. It provides a framework for identifying, tracing, freezing, seizing, and confiscating proceeds of crime, and for prosecuting offenders. The Act also includes provisions for cooperation with other countries to combat money laundering.


Statement 2 is largely correct, although the phrasing is slightly misleading. The RTI Act does allow for the exemption of information related to national security and law enforcement agencies.  However, this exemption is not absolute and is subject to certain conditions and procedures.  The statement creates a misleading impression of a complete exclusion.  The Act still provides a robust mechanism for citizens to access government information, while acknowledging the limitations due to national security concerns. The key is that the exclusion isn't absolute; it's a carefully considered exception.



**7.  With reference to India's demographic trends, consider the following statements:**

1. India's total fertility rate (TFR) has been steadily declining since 2011, indicating a shift towards smaller family sizes, but the rate remains above the replacement level.
2.  While India experiences a significant level of internal migration, the rate of international migration, relative to the total population, is comparatively low.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's TFR has indeed shown a consistent downward trend since 2011. This reflects changing societal norms, increased access to family planning services, and rising levels of female education.  However, it is crucial to note that the TFR is still above the replacement level (around 2.1), meaning the population continues to grow although at a slower pace.

Statement 2 is also correct.  India experiences substantial internal migration, driven by factors like rural-urban movement and inter-state job opportunities.  However, relative to its massive population, the level of international migration is comparatively lower than many other countries.  This is partly due to stringent visa regulations and other factors affecting emigration.  The statement accurately captures the relative scales of internal and international migration in India.


**8. With reference to India's participation in international organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. India's membership in the Group of 20 (G20) is primarily focused on economic cooperation and global governance, with limited involvement in security and political discussions.
2. India's participation in the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) primarily focuses on advocating for the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" (CBDR-RC), highlighting the historical context of greenhouse gas emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India actively participates in G20 economic discussions, its involvement extends to security and political matters. The G20 addresses a wide range of issues, including global security, counter-terrorism, and political cooperation among member states.  India's engagement in these areas is substantial, making the statement's assertion about limited involvement inaccurate.


Statement 2 is largely correct. India's participation in the COP meetings consistently emphasizes the principle of CBDR-RC, arguing that developed countries bear greater responsibility for historical greenhouse gas emissions and should contribute more significantly to climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.  India's arguments often highlight the disparity between its historical contribution and its current development needs.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CITES does *not* prohibit all international trade in endangered species.  Instead, it regulates international trade to ensure it's sustainable and legal.  The convention categorizes species into three appendices based on their threat level, with Appendix I containing the most endangered species,  subject to the strictest trade controls.  Trade is not entirely banned, but highly regulated and permitted only under exceptional circumstances.  A complete prohibition would be counterproductive to conservation efforts in many cases, as it could drive illegal trade.  The focus is on sustainable management and legal trade where possible.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is indeed a signatory to CITES and has implemented national laws to help enforce its provisions (like the Wildlife Protection Act),  these national laws do *not* supersede CITES. CITES provides a framework, but each signatory nation is responsible for its own domestic legislation to implement the convention's guidelines.  National laws may be stricter than CITES requirements, but they don't replace the international treaty's obligations.  The two legal frameworks work in tandem, not in a hierarchical relationship.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the IUCN Red List:**

1. The IUCN Red List assigns only two conservation statuses:  "Least Concern" and "Critically Endangered."
2. The IUCN Red List solely focuses on the population size of a species when determining its conservation status.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IUCN Red List utilizes a far more nuanced system for categorizing species' conservation status.  It employs several categories, including "Least Concern," "Near Threatened," "Vulnerable," "Endangered," and "Critically Endangered," each representing a different level of extinction risk.  The categorization considers various factors beyond a simple binary classification.  A simplified approach would fail to capture the complexity of extinction risk assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IUCN Red List's assessment of a species' conservation status relies on multiple criteria, not just population size. These criteria include population size reduction, geographic range restriction, small population size and decline, and quantitative analysis of extinction risk.  Habitat loss, environmental pressures, and other threats are also significant factors considered in the comprehensive evaluation, making population size only one piece of a complex puzzle.


**3. With reference to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), consider the following statements:**

1. The IUCN drafted the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
2. The IUCN's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IUCN is a major player in global conservation and significantly contributes to biodiversity conservation efforts, it did *not* draft the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The CBD was a product of the United Nations and was adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.  The IUCN, however, is a key partner in the implementation of the CBD, providing scientific expertise and support to its conservation initiatives.  Attributing the CBD's drafting solely to the IUCN overlooks the significant role of the United Nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IUCN's headquarters are located in Gland, Switzerland, not Geneva.  Geneva is another important city in Switzerland, which may lead to confusion, particularly for those less familiar with the precise location of international organizations.  The correct location of the IUCN headquarters is a specific fact that requires precise knowledge.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES):**

1. CITES categorizes species into three appendices based on their level of threat, with Appendix III including the least threatened species.
2.  The CITES agreement replaces national laws related to the international trade of endangered species.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CITES does categorize species into three appendices based on their threat level, Appendix III does *not* contain the least threatened species. Appendix I lists the most endangered species,  Appendix II lists species not necessarily threatened with extinction but which may become so unless trade is controlled, and Appendix III lists species protected in at least one country and which require cooperation of other Parties in the control of trade. The placement of species within these appendices reflects the level of protection needed, not a simple ranking from least to most threatened.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  CITES does *not* replace national laws. It sets an international framework for regulating trade, but each signatory country is responsible for enacting and enforcing its own domestic legislation to comply with CITES.  National laws may be more or less stringent than CITES requirements, but CITES does not supplant national legal systems.  This is a crucial distinction for understanding the convention's operational mechanism.


**5. With reference to the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ZSI is primarily responsible for the assessment of proposals related to the commercial release of genetically modified (GM) crops in India.
2.  The ZSI's main function is the discovery and documentation of new plant species in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ZSI's mandate is focused on zoological research, not the assessment of GM crops. This responsibility falls under the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), which operates under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.  Confusing the roles of these two distinct organizations demonstrates a lack of understanding of their respective functions within India's scientific and regulatory framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ZSI does contribute to the discovery and documentation of new species, its scope is broader than just plants. It conducts research on India's diverse fauna, encompassing animals, including insects, fish, reptiles and birds.  The ZSI's work is crucial for understanding India's biodiversity, but limiting its role to plant species is an oversimplification.


**6.  With reference to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The GEAC operates under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
2. The GEAC approved the commercial release of Bt cotton in India in 2002.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GEAC operates under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.  This distinction highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory framework for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in India, where environmental concerns play a significant role alongside agricultural considerations.  The GEAC's function is to ensure that the release of GMOs does not pose significant environmental risks.

Statement 2 is correct. The GEAC did indeed approve the commercial release of Bt cotton in India in 2002. This decision marked a significant step in the adoption of genetically modified crops in Indian agriculture and has had substantial impacts on cotton production and the associated industry.  This is a significant event in the history of agricultural biotechnology in India.


**7. With reference to  "Miyawaki forests," consider the following statements:**

2.  Miyawaki forests are typically established on previously degraded land unsuitable for conventional forestry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Miyawaki method *does not* involve planting a single species. A key principle of the Miyawaki method is the planting of diverse native species, typically two to four different types of indigenous trees within every square meter, mimicking the natural stratification of a forest.  This biodiversity is essential for the long-term health and resilience of the forest ecosystem.  A monoculture approach would be vulnerable to pests and diseases.

Statement 2 is correct.  Miyawaki forests are specifically designed for rapid afforestation on degraded lands that have been previously used for construction, agriculture, or other purposes where conventional forestry techniques might prove inefficient. The method aims to restore forest cover quickly and efficiently on sites that are otherwise difficult to reforest, making it a valuable tool for urban greening and ecological restoration.


**8.  With reference to the Pink Bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella), consider the following statements:**

1. The Pink Bollworm primarily damages sugarcane crops.
2.  The Pink Bollworm is native to Asia and has spread globally to nearly all cotton-growing regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pink Bollworm is a significant pest of *cotton*, not sugarcane.  It infests the developing cotton fruit, damaging the flower buds and bolls, which contain the cotton fibers.  The pest's life cycle is closely tied to cotton cultivation, and its presence is a major concern for cotton farmers worldwide.  Confusing it with a sugarcane pest reveals a misunderstanding of the pest's biology and agricultural impacts.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pink Bollworm is indeed native to Asia and has spread globally, now present in almost every region where cotton is grown.  Its cryptic nature, where damage is only apparent when the cotton bolls open, makes it a particularly challenging pest to control, highlighting the need for effective monitoring and management strategies in cotton cultivation.


**9. With reference to the Sarus crane, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Western Ghats moderates the tropical climate of the region and is home to over 325 globally threatened flora and fauna species; it is a 1,600-km long mountain range along the west coast of India, running from the river Tapi in the north to Kanyakumari in the south.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Western Ghats span *six*, not seven states. The percentage of the range in Karnataka is correctly stated.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Western Ghats' geographical extent, climatic influence, and biodiversity significance, making it the most appropriate answer.  The statement correctly specifies the range's length and endpoints.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is assessed as "difficult" for each question due to the intricate factual nature and the inclusion of plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Western Ghats:**

1. The Gadgil Committee report primarily focused on the economic benefits derived from the Western Ghats' rich biodiversity, recommending strategies for sustainable resource extraction.
2.  The Western Ghats are characterized by a steep gradient, causing rapid water flow and contributing to the formation of a significant water divide in peninsular India, influencing regional wind patterns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Gadgil Committee did consider economic aspects, its primary focus was on the ecological sensitivity of the Western Ghats and the need for stringent conservation measures to protect its biodiversity.  The committee's recommendations emphasized limiting human activity and development to minimize environmental impact, rather than promoting resource extraction.  The report highlighted the vulnerability of the region to landslides and deforestation, advocating for sustainable development practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The Western Ghats are indeed characterized by a steep gradient, leading to rapid water flow and the formation of a significant water divide. This orographic effect is crucial for the region's hydrology and influences the direction and intensity of regional wind patterns, impacting rainfall distribution across peninsular India.  The steep slopes also make the region susceptible to landslides, a major environmental concern. The statement accurately reflects the geographical characteristics and their cascading effects on the environment.


**2. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri range, converge with the Eastern Ghats near the Godavari River basin, forming a continuous mountain range across peninsular India.
2. The Western Ghats are primarily composed of laterite soils, formed during the Late Cenozoic period, supporting a unique biome including Sub-tropical Moist Pine Forests and Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Western Ghats are indeed known as the Sahyadri range, they do *not* converge with the Eastern Ghats to form a continuous range. There's a significant gap between the two ranges.  The Godavari River basin lies in the region between the Western and Eastern Ghats, highlighting the distinct nature of these two mountain systems.  They are geographically separate entities, though both contribute to the overall topography of peninsular India.

Statement 2 is largely correct, although it simplifies a complex reality.  Laterite soils are prevalent in the Western Ghats, and their formation is indeed linked to the geological processes of the Late Cenozoic era.  The Western Ghats do support diverse biomes, including those mentioned (Sub-tropical Moist Pine Forests and Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests), along with other types of forests and vegetation depending on altitude and rainfall. However,  the statement's implication that *only* laterite soils are present is an oversimplification.  Other soil types also exist within the Western Ghats.


**3. With reference to the ecological significance of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats' high rainfall contributes to the formation of numerous rivers, including the Cauvery, Sharavati, and Pamba, which are vital for the region's agricultural production and support a rich diversity of flora and fauna.
2. The rain-shadow effect created by the Western Ghats results in significantly lower rainfall on the Arabian Sea coast compared to the Bay of Bengal coast, leading to the development of distinct ecological zones along the Western Coastal Plain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats receive exceptionally high rainfall, acting as a crucial water divide.  This high precipitation fuels numerous rivers, including the Cauvery, Sharavati, and Pamba, which are essential for agriculture and support the region's biodiversity.  The rivers originating in the Western Ghats contribute significantly to the irrigation needs of the surrounding plains, supporting various crops and sustaining diverse ecosystems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rain-shadow effect caused by the Western Ghats results in *lesser* rainfall on the leeward (eastern) side, impacting the ecological zones of the Deccan Plateau. However, the statement incorrectly suggests that the Arabian Sea coast (the western side, which is the windward side) experiences less rainfall than the Bay of Bengal coast. In reality, the windward side (Arabian Sea coast) receives considerably more rainfall due to the orographic effect. The statement misrepresents the direction of the rain-shadow effect.


**4. With reference to conservation efforts related to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), chaired by Madhav Gadgil, recommended the establishment of a Western Ghats Ecology Authority (WGEA) with extensive powers to regulate development activities in the region.
2. The Kasturirangan Committee report, while acknowledging the ecological significance of the Western Ghats, proposed a more moderate approach to conservation compared to the WGEEP report, focusing on Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) rather than a blanket ban on development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), headed by Madhav Gadgil, indeed proposed the creation of a Western Ghats Ecology Authority (WGEA) with significant regulatory powers to oversee development and conservation within the Western Ghats region. This was a key recommendation of the report. The suggested authority was intended to play a strong role in balancing developmental interests with environmental protection.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Kasturirangan Committee report, while advocating for the conservation of the Western Ghats, proposed a less stringent approach than the WGEEP. Instead of a blanket ban on development in the entire Western Ghats region, the Kasturirangan report suggested identifying and protecting specific Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs), allowing for more flexibility in development outside these designated zones. This represents a different approach to conservation, focusing on targeted protection rather than a complete restriction.  Both committees aimed at Western Ghats conservation, but differed in their approach.


**5. With reference to the UNESCO World Heritage status of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2012, primarily for their exceptional biodiversity, including a significant number of endemic species of flora and fauna.
2. The UNESCO World Heritage inscription of the Western Ghats has led to a complete cessation of all development activities within the designated World Heritage Site, ensuring the region's pristine ecological integrity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Western Ghats were indeed inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2012.  The primary reason for this recognition was the region's exceptional biodiversity, characterized by high levels of endemism (species found nowhere else). The Western Ghats are a biodiversity hotspot, home to a vast array of unique plant and animal species. The UNESCO designation highlights the global importance of this ecological region.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the UNESCO World Heritage status provides a framework for conservation and sustainable management, it does *not* automatically lead to a complete halt of all development activities within the site.  The inscription calls for responsible management that balances conservation needs with the socio-economic needs of local communities.  Development projects may still be allowed, provided they meet stringent environmental standards and do not compromise the integrity of the World Heritage Site.  Balancing development and conservation is a key challenge.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UPSC conducts examinations for all-India services, central services, and public services of the centrally administered territories, but excludes selection for Commissions/Tribunals and diplomatic posts.
2.  The UPSC's advice on appointments to civil services can be rejected by the Ministry/Department concerned if deemed unsuitable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The UPSC is indeed responsible for recruiting to All-India Services, Central Services, and public services of centrally administered territories. However, the statement incorrectly states that it *excludes* selection for Commissions/Tribunals and diplomatic posts. While the UPSC doesn't directly handle these appointments in all cases, its role in the selection process for some of these positions can vary depending on the specific requirements and government decisions.  The UPSC's primary focus is on merit-based recruitment to the civil services, but its influence extends to other areas.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies a nuanced reality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UPSC's advice on appointments to civil services generally carries significant weight and is rarely rejected.  While the final appointing authority rests with the President of India, the UPSC's recommendations are crucial and form the backbone of the merit-based selection process. The Constitution safeguards the UPSC's independence to a large degree, ensuring its advice is not lightly disregarded.  The government can, in certain exceptional circumstances, depart from UPSC recommendations, but this is rare and subject to scrutiny.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1.  The RBI manages the nation's currency, including banknotes (except the one-rupee note) and coins, but does not have any liability for e-Rupee.
2.  The RBI regulates the Indian banking system, including Scheduled Commercial Banks and Urban Cooperative Banks,  but does not regulate Payment Banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The RBI is responsible for the management of India's currency, including the issuance of banknotes (excluding the one-rupee note, which is issued by the Ministry of Finance) and coins. However, the statement is misleading in stating that the RBI has *no* liability for e-Rupee. While the liability for physical currency is clearly defined, the liability structure for the e-Rupee is a complex evolving aspect of the digital currency's introduction. The RBI's role in managing the digital rupee includes ensuring its stability and security, hence carrying implicit liability. The statement oversimplifies this complex issue.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI’s regulatory function extends to a vast spectrum of financial institutions. While it indeed regulates Scheduled Commercial Banks and Urban Cooperative Banks, it also plays a crucial role in regulating and licensing Payment Banks.  These banks, while operating under a different framework, are still subject to RBI oversight regarding their operations, financial health, and compliance with regulations.  The omission of Payment Banks from the statement renders it inaccurate.


**3. With reference to the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RDSS aims to reduce Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% and the Average Cost of Supply (ACS)-Average Revenue Realised (ARR) gap to zero by 2024-25, excluding private sector DISCOMs.
2.  RDSS subsumes schemes like the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), and the Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP)-2015, and prioritizes smart metering in all Union Territories.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in its aim to reduce AT&C losses and the ACS-ARR gap.  However, the claim that it *excludes* private sector DISCOMs is incorrect. While the primary focus is on improving the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of DISCOMs, the RDSS does not explicitly exclude private sector DISCOMs from participation or benefits.  The scheme's eligibility criteria and implementation might vary depending on the DISCOM's structure, but it doesn't inherently exclude private entities.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that RDSS does indeed subsume IPDS, DDUGJY, and PMDP-2015.  However, the assertion that it prioritizes smart metering in *all* Union Territories is an overstatement. While the RDSS strongly encourages and supports smart metering across the country, including UTs,  the prioritization isn't absolute and may depend on factors like existing infrastructure, AT&C losses, and other relevant criteria. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the scheme's priorities.


**4. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative, aims to enable instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic Fast Payments Systems (FPS) across all ASEAN countries.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) joined Project Nexus, and as a result, India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) will be interlinked with FPSs of Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Project Nexus does aim to enable instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic FPSs, its scope is not limited to *all* ASEAN countries.  The initiative involves a select group of countries initially, focusing on building a functional framework before expanding.  The statement presents an overbroad generalization of the project's current reach.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's participation in Project Nexus is accurate, and the interlinking of India's UPI with the specified ASEAN countries' FPSs is a direct outcome of this participation.  This reflects a significant step towards facilitating faster and more efficient cross-border payments, leveraging the success of India's UPI system on the global stage.  This statement accurately reflects a specific, verifiable fact.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the India Meteorological Department (IMD):**

1. The IMD, established in 1875, is a Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre under the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and operates under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, having 6 regional centers.
2. Recent IMD initiatives include the National Framework of Climate Services (NFCS) and an Indigenously Developed Decision Support System (WAFES), but exclude a mobile application for weather-related services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IMD's establishment date, its status as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre of the WMO, and its operational structure under the Ministry of Earth Sciences are all accurate. The number of regional meteorological centers is also correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement correctly identifies NFCS and WAFES as recent IMD initiatives. However, it wrongly claims that IMD *excludes* a mobile application for weather-related services. In reality, the IMD has indeed launched a mobile application (MAUSAM) providing weather-related services, making the statement inaccurate.  The omission of a key initiative undermines the accuracy of the statement.


These questions demand detailed knowledge of specific facts and figures related to various organizations and schemes, making them challenging for examinees while testing their factual recall and analytical abilities.  The distractors are designed to be plausible and require careful consideration of the details provided.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to B cells and T cells, consider the following statements:**

1.  B cells differentiate into plasma cells, which are responsible for producing antibodies, and memory B cells, which provide long-term immunity.
2.  Helper T cells (Th) directly destroy infected cells, while cytotoxic T cells (Tc) assist in activating B cells and other T cells.
3.  Both B cells and T cells originate in the bone marrow and are crucial components of the adaptive immune system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. B cells are indeed a crucial part of the adaptive immune response. Upon activation by an antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells, which are antibody factories, and memory B cells, providing immunological memory for faster and more effective responses to future encounters with the same antigen.  This is a fundamental aspect of humoral immunity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The roles of Helper T cells (Th) and Cytotoxic T cells (Tc) are reversed. Helper T cells are crucial for activating both B cells and cytotoxic T cells. They release cytokines that stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Cytotoxic T cells (Tc), on the other hand, are the primary effectors of cell-mediated immunity, directly killing infected or cancerous cells.

Statement 3 is correct. Both B cells and T cells originate in the bone marrow, a primary lymphoid organ. While T cells mature in the thymus,  their initial development begins in the bone marrow.  They are both key players in the adaptive immune response, providing specific and targeted immunity against pathogens.


**2. With reference to fungi and their ecological roles, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fungi are exclusively heterotrophic organisms, incapable of producing their own food through photosynthesis.
2.  All species of fungi form mycorrhizal associations with plant roots, benefiting both the fungus and the plant.
3.  Fungi play a vital role in nutrient cycling, particularly in the decomposition of organic matter, thereby releasing essential nutrients back into the ecosystem.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms; they cannot produce their own food through photosynthesis like plants. They obtain nutrients by absorbing organic matter from their environment, either as saprophytes (decomposers), parasites, or symbionts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many fungal species do form mycorrhizal associations—mutually beneficial relationships with plant roots—this is not true for all fungal species.  Many fungi are saprophytic, parasitic, or engage in other symbiotic relationships.  The statement overgeneralizes the ecological interactions of fungi.

Statement 3 is correct. Fungi are essential decomposers in most ecosystems. They secrete enzymes that break down complex organic molecules, releasing simpler nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus back into the soil. This process is crucial for nutrient cycling and the overall health of ecosystems.  Their role in decomposition is a key component of many biogeochemical cycles.


**3. With reference to  CAR T-cell therapy, consider the following statements:**

1. CAR T-cell therapy involves genetically modifying a patient's own T cells to target cancer cells expressing specific antigens like CD19.
2.  The modified T cells in CAR T-cell therapy are primarily B cells, which are then infused back into the patient to eliminate cancerous cells.
3.  A significant risk associated with CAR T-cell therapy is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potentially life-threatening complication caused by an overactive immune response.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. CAR T-cell therapy is a revolutionary cancer treatment that harnesses the power of a patient's own immune system.  T cells are extracted, genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting specific cancer antigens (like CD19), and then re-infused.  These modified T cells then specifically recognize and destroy cancer cells.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The T cells used in CAR T-cell therapy are T lymphocytes, not B cells.  B cells produce antibodies, while T cells directly attack infected or cancerous cells. The confusion might arise from the fact that both cell types are involved in the immune response, but CAR T-cell therapy specifically targets T cells.

Statement 3 is correct. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a significant side effect of CAR T-cell therapy.  The massive activation of T cells leads to a surge in cytokine production, causing a potentially dangerous inflammatory response that can affect multiple organs.  Managing CRS is a crucial aspect of CAR T-cell therapy.


**4. With reference to Lichen, consider the following statements:**

1. Lichens are symbiotic organisms composed of a fungus and an alga, with the fungus providing structure and the alga providing food through photosynthesis.
2. Lichens are highly sensitive to air pollution, making them valuable bioindicators of environmental quality.
3. Lichens reproduce primarily through the production of spores, similar to how fungi reproduce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lichens are a classic example of a mutualistic symbiotic relationship. The fungal component provides structure and protection for the algal partner, while the alga, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium, produces food through photosynthesis. This partnership allows them to thrive in diverse and often harsh environments.

Statement 2 is correct. Lichens are extremely sensitive to air pollution, particularly sulfur dioxide and other pollutants. Because of this sensitivity, their presence or absence can be a good indicator of air quality.  They are often used as bioindicators in environmental monitoring programs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While lichens do produce structures called soredia that aid in reproduction, these are not spores in the same way fungi produce spores. Soredia contain both fungal hyphae and algal cells, representing a vegetative form of reproduction.  The statement oversimplifies the complex reproductive mechanisms of lichens.


**5. With reference to  Probiotics, consider the following statements:**

1. Probiotics consist solely of beneficial bacteria; yeasts are not considered probiotics.
2. Probiotics are only effective when ingested; they cannot naturally colonize the gut.
3. Probiotics can aid in the digestion of lactose (milk sugar) by producing enzymes that break down lactose.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many probiotics are bacterial, some are yeast-based. The definition of a probiotic is broader than just bacteria. It encompasses live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While probiotics are often ingested through foods like yogurt, some strains can naturally colonize the gut, even if their presence may be transient.  The effectiveness of probiotics is not solely dependent on ingestion.

Statement 3 is correct.  Certain probiotic strains produce lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose. This can be beneficial for individuals with lactose intolerance, helping them digest dairy products more easily.  This is a well-established application of probiotics.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding heavy metal pollution:**

1.  The primary source of heavy metal contamination in groundwater is industrial discharge, specifically from facilities like the Thoothukudi plant.
2.  Aquatic plants, such as water hyacinth, effectively absorb and remove heavy metals from water bodies, contributing to bioremediation efforts.
3.  The Indian Standard (IS) 10500 sets stringent limits on heavy metal concentrations in drinking water, ensuring public health safety.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplified. While industrial discharges, including those from the Thoothukudi plant, are significant contributors to heavy metal contamination in groundwater,  other sources like mining activities, agricultural runoff (pesticides and fertilizers), and even leaching from scrapped electronic components also play a substantial role.  Focusing solely on industrial discharge ignores the multifaceted nature of heavy metal pollution.

Statement 2 is correct.  Aquatic plants, including water hyacinth, possess a remarkable ability to absorb heavy metals from their environment. This phytoremediation technique is actively explored for cost-effective and environmentally friendly cleanup of contaminated water bodies.  Water hyacinth's high biomass and efficient uptake of heavy metals make it a particularly useful tool in bioremediation.

Statement 3 is correct.  IS 10500 is an Indian Standard that specifies permissible limits for various contaminants, including heavy metals, in drinking water.  Adherence to these standards is crucial for ensuring the safety and potability of water supplies and safeguarding public health.  The standard sets maximum allowable concentrations to prevent adverse health effects associated with heavy metal ingestion.


**2. With reference to Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) pollution, consider the following statements:**

1.  SO2 primarily contributes to acid rain through its conversion into sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, impacting water bodies and ecosystems.
2.  Coal-fired power plants are the most significant anthropogenic emitters of SO2, posing a substantial threat to air quality.
3.  Wet scrubbers are an effective technology for removing SO2 from industrial emissions, mitigating its environmental impact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  SO2 reacts with atmospheric water vapor and oxygen to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a primary component of acid rain.  Acid rain causes significant environmental damage, including acidification of lakes and streams, soil degradation, and damage to vegetation and infrastructure.  The process involves complex atmospheric chemistry.

Statement 2 is correct.  Coal combustion in power plants releases large quantities of SO2 into the atmosphere.  Coal is a significant source of sulfur, and its burning without adequate pollution control measures contributes substantially to SO2 pollution, particularly in areas with high concentrations of coal-fired power plants.  This is a major concern for air quality management.

Statement 3 is correct.  Wet scrubbers are a widely used technology for removing SO2 from industrial flue gases.  These systems utilize a liquid scrubbing agent (often a slurry of lime or limestone) to absorb SO2, effectively reducing its emissions.  Wet scrubbers are a critical component of many industrial pollution control strategies, helping to meet environmental regulations.


**3. With reference to the applications of steel slag, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hepatitis B virus is transmitted primarily through sexual contact, while HIV transmission occurs solely through blood contact.
2.  A vaccine exists for Hepatitis B, but there is currently no effective vaccine available for Hepatitis C.
3.  The global prevalence of Hepatitis B and C infections is significantly lower than that of HIV.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both Hepatitis B and HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact, although the efficiency of transmission varies.  Hepatitis B is also transmitted through percutaneous exposure (e.g., sharing needles) and perinatal transmission (mother to child). HIV transmission is primarily through sexual contact, blood-to-blood contact (e.g., sharing needles), and mother-to-child transmission.  The statement oversimplifies the complex transmission routes of both viruses.

Statement 2 is correct. A vaccine exists for Hepatitis B, offering effective protection against infection.  However, currently, there is no licensed vaccine for Hepatitis C.  Significant research is ongoing to develop a Hepatitis C vaccine, but none have proven effective enough for widespread use.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Globally, the number of people chronically infected with Hepatitis B and C viruses far surpasses the number of people living with HIV.  Hepatitis B and C represent a significant global health burden, affecting millions more than HIV.  The World Health Organization (WHO) considers both major public health challenges requiring substantial global efforts for prevention, treatment and elimination.


**2. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are primarily used to treat bacterial infections, while antiviral medications are the standard treatment for HIV.
2.  Egypt has made significant progress toward eliminating Hepatitis C, while the global elimination of HIV remains a distant goal.
3.  The National Viral Hepatitis Control Program (2019) primarily focuses on eliminating Hepatitis B, while other programs address HIV.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a type of targeted therapy used to treat various conditions, including certain cancers and some viral infections. While they are not a primary treatment for bacterial infections, they are effective against specific viral infections, including some cases of HIV. Antiviral medications are the cornerstone of HIV treatment, but mAbs also play a role in specific therapeutic strategies.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Egypt has shown remarkable success in reducing the prevalence of Hepatitis C through large-scale screening and treatment programs.  While progress is being made globally towards HIV elimination, a complete eradication is still a long-term goal due to the complexities of transmission and the challenges of reaching vulnerable populations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Viral Hepatitis Control Program (2019) is explicitly focused on the elimination of Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B. The statement wrongly attributes the program's focus solely to Hepatitis B and incorrectly suggests that HIV is addressed separately.  Many public health initiatives address both viral diseases simultaneously.


**3. With reference to viral infections and their treatment, consider the following statements:**

1.  Antiviral medications are highly effective in treating all types of viral infections, including Hepatitis B and C.
2.  The similarity in transmission routes between Hepatitis B and HIV necessitates similar preventative measures for both diseases.
3.  Cirrhosis and Hepato-cellular carcinoma are potential complications associated with both Hepatitis B and C infections.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While antiviral medications are crucial in treating Hepatitis C and improving outcomes, their effectiveness varies across viral infections.  The treatment for Hepatitis B is different and includes interferon-alpha and nucleoside/nucleotide analogs.  There are no "cure-all" antiviral medications effective against all viruses.

Statement 2 is correct.  The transmission routes of Hepatitis B and HIV share similarities, particularly concerning sexual transmission and parenteral transmission (through blood or other bodily fluids).  Therefore, preventative measures such as safe sex practices and avoiding sharing needles are crucial for preventing both infections.

Statement 3 is correct.  Cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and Hepato-cellular carcinoma (liver cancer) are severe, long-term complications that can develop in individuals chronically infected with both Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.  These complications highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to mitigate these risks.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment is a significant risk factor for Hepatitis B transmission, but not for Hepatitis C.
2.  Both Hepatitis B and C infections often present with easily identifiable symptoms in the early stages of infection.
3.  The development of effective vaccines for Hepatitis A and B has significantly reduced the global incidence of these viral infections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, particularly needles and syringes, is a significant transmission route for *both* Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.  The statement incorrectly limits this risk factor to Hepatitis B.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Many individuals infected with Hepatitis B and C are asymptomatic (show no symptoms) for extended periods, sometimes for years or even decades.  The lack of early symptoms contributes to the difficulty in controlling the spread of these infections.

Statement 3 is correct.  The development and widespread use of effective vaccines for Hepatitis A and B have significantly reduced the incidence and prevalence of these diseases globally.  Vaccination programs have been instrumental in preventing infections and their associated complications.  This contrasts with the lack of a vaccine for Hepatitis C which continues to pose a significant challenge.

Statement 3 is correct.  Boron is a micronutrient that enhances calcium absorption and utilization in the body, impacting bone health and other physiological processes.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, making (d) the appropriate choice.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of the accurate statements.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding thorium-based nuclear reactors:**

1. Thorium reactors inherently operate at significantly higher pressures than uranium-based reactors, enhancing safety.
2.  The primary advantage of thorium over uranium is its greater abundance and lower cost of extraction.
3. Thorium-based breeder reactors (like the Stage 3 Reactor) produce significantly less long-lived radioactive waste compared to uranium-based reactors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Thorium reactors, particularly molten salt reactors, are designed to operate at atmospheric pressure or near-atmospheric pressure, a key safety feature. Higher pressure is associated with increased risk in nuclear reactors.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that thorium is more abundant than uranium. However, the "lower cost of extraction" part is an oversimplification. While thorium is abundant, the extraction and processing of thorium from monazite sand can be complex and costly, potentially negating some of the cost advantage.  The main advantage is abundance, leading to enhanced energy security.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. With reference to the chemical compound Aspartame, consider the following statements:**

1. Aspartame's low-calorie nature stems from its rapid conversion into non-caloric metabolites within the human body.
2.  The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has explicitly prohibited the use of Aspartame in food products due to potential health risks.
3. Aspartic acid and phenylalanine are the primary amino acids constituting Aspartame.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aspartame, while composed of amino acids and providing calories theoretically, is metabolized differently than other amino acids.  It breaks down into aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol.  These metabolites yield negligible calories, making it suitable as a low-calorie sweetener.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified aspartame as "possibly carcinogenic to humans," this classification does not constitute an outright ban.  FSSAI, like many regulatory bodies worldwide, allows its use within permitted daily intake levels. The statement incorrectly asserts a complete prohibition.

Statement 3 is correct. Aspartic acid and phenylalanine are indeed the fundamental amino acids that constitute Aspartame.  This is a key component of its chemical structure and function.



**2. With reference to the Ionosphere and radio communication, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ionosphere's ability to reflect radio waves is primarily due to the presence of a high concentration of ozone molecules.
2. The Exosphere, located above the Ionosphere, significantly contributes to the reflection of radio waves used in terrestrial communication.
3.  Geomagnetic storms, often triggered by solar flares, can disrupt the Ionosphere, thereby affecting radio wave propagation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ozone plays a crucial role in the stratosphere (absorbing harmful UV radiation), the Ionosphere's ability to reflect radio waves is primarily due to the ionization of gases by solar radiation (Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and x-ray solar radiation).  The high concentration of charged particles in the ionosphere, not ozone, facilitates reflection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere and doesn't play a significant role in reflecting radio waves used for terrestrial communication.  The Ionosphere is the key player in this process.

Statement 3 is correct. Geomagnetic storms, caused by disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field due to solar activity, can significantly alter the density and distribution of charged particles in the Ionosphere. This disruption affects the propagation of radio waves, leading to signal fading or complete blackout.



**3. Consider the following statements regarding free radicals and environmental processes:**

1. Free radicals primarily accelerate the depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
2. The presence of free radicals in the troposphere contributes significantly to the formation of photochemical smog.
3.  Free radicals are exclusively produced through anthropogenic (human-induced) activities, such as industrial emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While free radicals can participate in ozone depletion, the primary mechanism involves catalytic cycles involving chlorine and bromine atoms (from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances). Free radicals play a secondary role compared to these catalytic cycles.

Statement 2 is correct. Free radicals are highly reactive chemical species that are crucial components of photochemical smog formation.  They initiate chain reactions involving nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, leading to the production of ozone and other secondary pollutants.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While human activities contribute significantly to free radical production (e.g., combustion processes), free radicals also occur naturally in the environment through various processes like UV radiation and lightning strikes.  They are not solely anthropogenic in origin.



**4. With reference to Neotame, consider the following statements:**

1. Neotame is a derivative of Aspartame, possessing a similar chemical structure but with enhanced sweetness.
2. Neotame is a low-calorie sweetener, metabolized in the body to produce significant amounts of calories.
3.  The IARC has classified Neotame as a potentially carcinogenic substance, similar to Aspartame.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Neotame is indeed a derivative of Aspartame. It's structurally similar but features a modified chemical structure that makes it significantly sweeter than Aspartame, requiring less to achieve the same level of sweetness.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Like Aspartame, Neotame is a low-calorie sweetener. Its metabolism yields very few calories because, similar to Aspartame, a significant portion is excreted unchanged. The statement wrongly claims it produces substantial calories.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The IARC has not classified Neotame as a potential carcinogen.  While Aspartame has been classified as "possibly carcinogenic,"  Neotame's safety profile has been assessed differently by regulatory bodies due to its structural differences and metabolic pathways.

**1. Consider the following statements about the Ionosphere:**

1. The Ionosphere's primary function in radio communication is the reflection of radio waves due to the presence of a high concentration of charged particles.
2.  The Ionosphere is primarily responsible for absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, protecting life on Earth.
3.  Earthquakes significantly disrupt the Ionosphere's structure and composition, leading to temporary communication blackouts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ionosphere contains a significant concentration of ionized particles (ions and electrons) created by the sun's ionizing radiation.  These charged particles interact with radio waves, causing them to refract and reflect back towards the Earth, enabling long-distance radio communication.  This is the Ionosphere's crucial role.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ozone layer in the Stratosphere is primarily responsible for absorbing harmful UV radiation, the Ionosphere plays a minimal role in this process. Its main function is related to radio wave propagation.

Statement 3 is correct.  Seismic activity, including earthquakes, can generate infrasonic waves that propagate upwards and interact with the Ionosphere. These interactions can cause disturbances in the ionosphere's structure and electron density, potentially affecting radio wave propagation and causing temporary communication disruptions.  This is a well-documented phenomenon. Therefore, the correct option is (c).


**2. With reference to the composition and properties of Ozone, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ozone in the stratosphere is primarily formed through the interaction of ultraviolet (UV) radiation with oxygen molecules.
2.  Ozone is a highly reactive molecule that readily decomposes in the presence of chlorine atoms, leading to ozone depletion.
3.  Ground-level ozone, a major component of photochemical smog, is beneficial to human health and plant growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Stratospheric ozone is formed naturally through a photochemical process.  Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun breaks down oxygen molecules (O2) into oxygen atoms (O). These highly reactive oxygen atoms then combine with other oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3).

Statement 2 is correct.  Chlorine atoms, primarily from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), act as catalysts in the decomposition of ozone. A single chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules before being removed from the stratosphere.  This catalytic cycle is the main mechanism behind ozone depletion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Ground-level ozone is a harmful pollutant, a key component of photochemical smog. It is a respiratory irritant and can damage plant tissues.  It is not beneficial to human health or plant growth.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**3. With reference to the characteristics of Ethanol as a biofuel, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ethanol produced from sugarcane has a higher energy density compared to ethanol derived from corn.
2.  The production of ethanol from sugarcane involves a fermentation process using yeast to convert sugars into ethanol.
3.  Blending ethanol with gasoline reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to using gasoline alone.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both sugarcane and corn are used to produce ethanol, the energy density of the resulting ethanol is largely similar. Differences may arise due to variations in processing and purification methods, but not due to the source material itself.

Statement 2 is correct. The production of ethanol from sugarcane (and other biomass sources) involves the fermentation of sugars by yeast. This is a well-established biochemical process.

Statement 3 is correct.  Ethanol is considered a renewable fuel source, and blending it with gasoline reduces the reliance on fossil fuels.  This reduces greenhouse gas emissions as ethanol's carbon footprint is lower during its lifecycle compared to fossil fuels. Therefore, the combination of statements 2 and 3 is correct.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the properties and applications of Graphene:**

1. Graphene is a good conductor of electricity but a poor conductor of heat.
2. Graphene's high surface area makes it suitable for use in energy storage applications like batteries and fuel cells.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Graphene is known for its exceptional thermal conductivity, making it an excellent heat conductor in addition to its electrical conductivity.

Statement 2 is correct.  The large surface area of graphene allows for efficient energy storage and transfer. This property makes it a promising material for use in batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While graphene can be produced synthetically, it also exists naturally in certain forms, such as in graphite. The cost of graphene varies depending on the production method and purity. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**5. With reference to the applications of Calcium-41 in scientific research, consider the following statements:**

1.  Calcium-41's long half-life makes it suitable for dating geological samples older than those datable by Carbon-14.
2.  The Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) technique is specifically designed for detecting and measuring extremely small quantities of Calcium-41.
3.  Calcium-41 is a readily available isotope in the Earth's atmosphere, making its detection relatively straightforward.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The significantly longer half-life of Calcium-41 (99,400 years) compared to Carbon-14 (5,700 years) allows it to be used for dating much older geological materials. Carbon-14 dating is limited to relatively recent organic materials.

Statement 2 is correct. ATTA is a highly sensitive technique specifically developed to measure trace amounts of rare isotopes like Calcium-41.  The extremely low concentrations of Calcium-41 in samples necessitate the use of such advanced analytical methods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Calcium-41 is not found in abundance in the Earth's atmosphere. It is primarily produced through cosmic ray interactions within the Earth's crust and is present in very low concentrations.  Its detection requires sophisticated techniques.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.

**1. Consider the following statements about the impact of nanoplastics on the human body:**

1.  Nanoplastics primarily accumulate in the kidneys, leading to renal dysfunction.
2.  The liver's influence on the immune system is significantly enhanced by the presence of nanoplastics.
3.  Hepatitis B, a viral liver disease, is directly caused by the accumulation of nanoplastics in the liver.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While research is ongoing regarding the bioaccumulation of nanoplastics, current evidence suggests that the liver, not the kidneys, is a primary accumulation site.  Nanoplastics' impact on renal function is not yet established as a direct and primary effect.  

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the liver plays a crucial role in immune system regulation, the presence of nanoplastics is likely to *negatively* influence this system through inflammation and damage, not enhance it.  Research indicates nanoplastics cause liver damage, impairing its overall function, including its role in immune modulation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Hepatitis B is caused by a virus, the hepatitis B virus (HBV), and is not related to nanoplastics.  Nanoplastics may exacerbate existing liver conditions or contribute to liver damage, but they are not the causative agent of viral hepatitis.  Confusing correlation with causation is a common error in interpreting scientific findings.


**2. With reference to the ecological role and conservation status of the Pitcher plant, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pitcher plants are primarily carnivorous, relying solely on insects for their nutritional needs.
2.  The CITES appendices list Pitcher plants as a species threatened with extinction globally.
3.  Pitcher plants primarily inhabit arid and desert environments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Pitcher plants are insectivorous, supplementing their nutrient intake through the digestion of insects, they are not solely reliant on this method. They can also obtain nutrients from the soil, albeit less efficiently.  Oversimplifying their nutritional strategy can be misleading.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  While not all Pitcher plant species are listed in CITES appendices, several are, due to habitat loss and over-collection. The statement’s generality needs to be clarified, but the core idea that some Pitcher plants are under conservation concern and are listed under CITES is correct.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Pitcher plants thrive in nutrient-poor, moist environments, typically bogs, swamps, and rainforests.  Their carnivorous nature is an adaptation to these environments with limited soil nutrients. Their presence in arid regions is unlikely.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding methane (CH₄) and its environmental impact:**

1.  Methane is a less potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (CO₂), contributing minimally to global warming.
2.  Methane emissions are primarily associated with volcanic activity and geothermal vents.
3.  Methane oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH) is a significant process in the atmospheric removal of this gas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Methane is a significantly *more* potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, meaning it traps heat more effectively per molecule. Although present in lower atmospheric concentrations, its global warming potential is much higher over a shorter time frame.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some methane is released from geological sources, the majority of anthropogenic (human-caused) methane emissions originate from agriculture (livestock, rice cultivation), landfills, fossil fuel extraction and use, and wastewater treatment.  Attributing emissions primarily to geological sources is a simplification.

Statement 3 is correct. The hydroxyl radical (OH) is a major oxidant in the troposphere, reacting with methane and converting it into carbon dioxide and water vapor. This process is a crucial natural sink for atmospheric methane, influencing its lifespan and overall impact.


**4. With reference to Lithium and its geopolitical significance, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's primary source of Lithium imports is currently Brazil, owing to its extensive reserves.
2.  The 'Lithium Triangle' refers to a region encompassing the major lithium reserves of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru.
3.  Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. (KABIL) is primarily focused on acquiring and securing supplies of cobalt, rather than lithium.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India imports lithium, Brazil is not its primary source.  Major suppliers include Australia, Chile, and Argentina.  Focusing on a single supplier ignores the complexities of global supply chains.

Statement 2 is correct. The 'Lithium Triangle' accurately designates the region in South America (Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia) known for its substantial lithium reserves.  The inclusion of Peru is a distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. KABIL's mandate explicitly includes securing supplies of critical minerals, including lithium, for India's strategic needs.  Concentrating on cobalt alone misrepresents the organization's broader objectives.  This statement is a deliberate attempt to mislead by focusing on a related but incorrect detail.

They achieve genome editing through precise cutting and rejoining of the DNA molecule itself, resulting in changes that are indistinguishable from those achieved through conventional breeding techniques.  SDN3, however, does involve foreign genetic material.

Statement 3 is correct. The example of low-pungent mustard development highlights the application of gene editing to reduce glucosinolates, thereby improving the taste and reducing potential health risks associated with high glucosinolate levels in livestock.


**2. With reference to Gene Silencing, consider the following statements:**

1.  RNA interference (RNAi) utilizes small RNA molecules (siRNA or miRNA) to block mRNA translation or degrade mRNA, thus silencing gene expression.
2.  Dicer is an enzyme that processes long double-stranded RNA molecules into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), a key step in RNA interference.
3.  Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) occurs after transcription, interfering with the process of protein synthesis from the mRNA.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. RNA interference is a crucial mechanism of gene silencing that uses small RNA molecules like siRNA and miRNA to target and either degrade mRNA or block its translation into proteins.  This prevents the expression of the targeted gene.

Statement 2 is correct.  Dicer is a crucial enzyme in the RNAi pathway. Its role is to cleave long double-stranded RNA molecules into shorter siRNAs, which are then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to mediate gene silencing.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) occurs *before* transcription. It involves mechanisms that prevent the gene from being transcribed into mRNA in the first place. Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), on the other hand, occurs after transcription, as described in the statement.


**3. With reference to the types of RNA, consider the following statements:**

1.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, binding to complementary sequences on target mRNAs to inhibit translation or cause mRNA degradation.
2.  Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are primarily involved in the process of DNA replication, ensuring accurate copying of the genetic information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression. They function in post-transcriptional gene silencing by binding to target mRNAs, leading to either translational repression or mRNA degradation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing, not DNA replication.  They are crucial components of the spliceosome, which removes introns from pre-mRNA molecules to produce mature mRNA.

Statement 3 is correct.  Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the chemical modification of other RNA molecules, particularly rRNAs and tRNAs. These modifications, such as methylation and pseudouridylation, are crucial for the proper function of these RNA molecules in protein synthesis.


**4. Consider the following statements about Epigenetics:**

1. Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence.

(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Epigenetics is defined by heritable changes in gene activity that do not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself. These changes are often mediated by chemical modifications to DNA or associated proteins.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DNA methylation is typically associated with *decreased* gene expression, although there are exceptions.  Methylation often silences genes by preventing transcription factors from binding to the DNA.

Statement 3 is correct. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, can significantly alter chromatin structure.  This affects the accessibility of DNA to transcription machinery, thereby influencing gene expression.  A more open chromatin structure generally leads to increased gene expression.


**5. With reference to Jumping Genes (Transposable Elements), consider the following statements:**

1. Jumping genes are DNA sequences capable of moving from one location to another within a genome.
2.  All jumping genes utilize a "cut-and-paste" mechanism, removing themselves from one site and inserting into another.

1.  The thermocline layer in the ocean is primarily characterized by rapid changes in salinity.
2.  Melting permafrost directly raises the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming.
3.  Changes in water density, significantly influenced by temperature variations, play a crucial role in ocean currents.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The thermocline is characterized by a rapid change in *temperature*, not salinity. While salinity does affect water density and can influence ocean currents, it's the temperature gradient that defines the thermocline.  Salinity changes primarily influence the halocline.

Statement 2 is correct.  Melting permafrost releases significant amounts of methane and carbon dioxide trapped within the frozen ground.  These are potent greenhouse gases, directly contributing to the increase in global temperatures and exacerbating climate change.  The release of these gases is a major concern related to climate change feedback loops.

Statement 3 is correct. Temperature significantly affects water density. Colder water is denser than warmer water. This density difference is the primary driving force behind thermohaline circulation, a crucial component of global ocean currents. These currents play a vital role in regulating global climate patterns and distributing heat around the planet.  The interplay between temperature and salinity influences the overall density of seawater, affecting the vertical and horizontal movement of water masses.


**94. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The cropping pattern in a region is primarily determined by the average annual precipitation, not the temperature.
2.  Altitude significantly influences temperature, with temperatures generally decreasing as altitude increases.
3.  Eleven distinct climatic regions are defined solely based on temperature variations across the globe.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While precipitation is a crucial factor influencing cropping patterns, temperature plays an equally vital, if not more significant, role.  The growing season length, the types of crops that can be cultivated, and the overall agricultural productivity are all heavily dependent on temperature.  Precipitation is necessary, but insufficient, to determine the type of agriculture that can be sustained.

Statement 2 is correct.  The adiabatic lapse rate describes the decrease in temperature with increasing altitude.  As air rises, it expands and cools, leading to a decrease in temperature. This is a fundamental principle in meteorology and geography.  This principle holds true across various geographical locations and is a crucial factor in determining climate patterns at different altitudes.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While temperature is a significant factor in climate classification, other factors such as precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns are equally important.  The Köppen climate classification system, for example, uses a combination of temperature and precipitation data to define various climate types.  Temperature alone is insufficient to comprehensively categorize the world's diverse climatic regions.


**95. Consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. During condensation, water vapor changes from a gaseous state to a liquid state.  This phase transition involves a decrease in volume, not an increase.  The molecules become more closely packed in the liquid phase, resulting in a smaller overall volume compared to the gaseous phase.  This principle is fundamental to understanding weather patterns and hydrological cycles.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Westerlies are prevailing winds in the mid-latitudes that blow from west to east.  These winds transport large masses of air, carrying with them variations in temperature and moisture.  They play a vital role in distributing heat and moisture across the globe, influencing regional climate patterns.  The movement of these air masses is a key component of global atmospheric circulation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Temperature significantly affects the solubility of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Higher temperatures generally decrease the solubility of CaCO3, while lower temperatures increase it. This is crucial in understanding processes like the formation and dissolution of limestone and coral reefs.  The chemical equilibrium of CaCO3 dissolution is sensitive to temperature changes.


**96. Consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A rapid decrease in atmospheric pressure often precedes the arrival of storms or low-pressure systems. Statement 2 is incorrect. Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, not increases. This is because the mass of air above decreases as you go higher. Statement 3 is correct. The Coriolis effect, caused by the Earth's rotation, deflects moving air masses (and thus pressure gradients) to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.  This effect is crucial in shaping weather patterns.

Statement 3 is also correct; copper's resistance to corrosion is a major factor in its use for various applications where durability is crucial.


**7. With reference to the phenomenon of refraction, consider the following statements:**

1. When light waves pass from air to glass, both their wavelength and velocity change, while the frequency remains constant.
2. The apparent shortening and bending of a stick when partially submerged in water, viewed from the side, is primarily due to the scattering of light by water molecules.
3.  A piece of copper and a piece of glass heated to the same temperature will feel differently hot to the touch because of differences in their thermal conductivity, not their density.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Refraction involves a change in the speed and wavelength of light as it passes from one medium to another. The frequency, however, remains constant. Statement 2 is incorrect. The apparent bending of the stick is due to refraction, not light scattering.  Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium (air) to another (water) with different refractive indices. Statement 3 is correct.  The difference in how hot the copper and glass feel is due to the difference in their thermal conductivities. Copper, being a better conductor, transfers heat away from the hand more quickly, giving a sensation of being hotter.  Density plays a negligible role in this phenomenon.


**8. With reference to  Radiometric Dating, consider the following statements:**

1.  Carbon-14 dating is suitable for determining the age of objects older than approximately 50,000 years.
2. Calcium-41, a rare long-lived radioisotope, can be used in radiometric dating using a technique called Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA).
3. Radiometric dating relies on the principle of radioactive decay, where the relative abundance of isotopes in a sample is used to estimate its age.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Carbon-14 dating is limited to dating organic materials up to around 50,000 years old because of its relatively short half-life. Beyond that time frame, the amount of remaining Carbon-14 becomes too small to measure accurately. Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the use of Calcium-41 and ATTA for radiometric dating, expanding the possibilities beyond Carbon-14. Statement 3 is also correct. Radiometric dating hinges on the predictable decay rates of radioactive isotopes. By comparing the ratio of parent isotopes to daughter isotopes, scientists can estimate the time elapsed since the sample formed.


**9. With reference to the Mass of a body, consider the following statements:**

1. The mass of a body remains constant regardless of the gravitational field it is in.
2.  A body with a mass of 100 kg on Earth would have a mass of approximately 16.67 kg on the Moon, given that the Moon's gravitational acceleration is about one-sixth that of Earth.
3. The weight of a body is directly proportional to its mass and the acceleration due to gravity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mass is an intrinsic property of matter and remains constant irrespective of location or gravitational field.  Weight, on the other hand, is the force of gravity acting on the mass and varies with gravitational acceleration. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Moon's gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's, this affects the *weight* of the body, not its mass. The mass remains 100 kg.  Statement 3 is correct. Weight (W) is calculated as W = mg, where 'm' is mass and 'g' is acceleration due to gravity.  Therefore, weight is directly proportional to both mass and gravitational acceleration.


**10. With reference to  Simple Pendulum Oscillations, consider the following statements:**

1. The time period of a simple pendulum is independent of the mass of the bob.
2. The time period of a simple pendulum increases with an increase in the length of the pendulum.
3.  The time period of a simple pendulum is directly proportional to the square root of the acceleration due to gravity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The time period of a simple pendulum is determined by its length and the acceleration due to gravity, but not the mass of the bob.  Statement 2 is correct.  The formula for the time period (T) of a simple pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length and g is acceleration due to gravity.  An increase in L leads to a larger T. Statement 3 is incorrect. The time period is *inversely* proportional to the square root of the acceleration due to gravity.  A higher 'g' results in a shorter time period.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the hormone Oxytocin:**

1. The Delhi High Court has issued specific legal directives concerning the misuse of Oxytocin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Indonesia and Malaysia are major rubber producers, but India also has a substantial rubber industry, making it a key player in global rubber production.

Statement 2 is correct. The growth of rubber trees is significantly influenced by altitude and climate.  High altitudes and unsuitable climates hamper growth, hence the limitation of 700 meters.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While increased rubber demand does put pressure on forest resources, vulcanization itself is not directly linked to deforestation.  Deforestation is primarily caused by the expansion of rubber plantations to meet the growing demand for rubber. The statement mistakenly attributes deforestation to the vulcanization process rather than to the expansion of plantations.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The speed of sound is directly related to the density and elasticity of the medium through which it travels.  Denser media generally offer greater resistance to the propagation of sound waves, resulting in a higher speed of sound. This is why sound travels faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While sound waves can induce seismic waves in the ground, the atmospheric propagation of sound waves is not directly converted into P-waves (primary seismic waves). P-waves are a type of seismic wave that travels through the Earth's interior, and their generation is related to seismic events like earthquakes, not the ordinary propagation of sound waves in the atmosphere.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The speed of sound in a given medium is dependent on the frequency of the sound, a phenomenon known as dispersion.  While the effect of dispersion is often negligible in many practical situations, it is not entirely absent.  The speed of sound shows slight variations with changes in frequency.

2.  The tendency of a liquid drop to minimize its surface area and assume a spherical shape is primarily due to viscosity, a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow.
3.  Ethylene glycol, a common antifreeze agent used in automobile engines, is an alcohol with a lower boiling point than water.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pressure is a scalar quantity; it has magnitude but not direction. Momentum, on the other hand, is a vector quantity possessing both magnitude and direction. The statement incorrectly characterizes both quantities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The tendency of a liquid drop to minimize its surface area and form a sphere is due to surface tension, not viscosity. Surface tension is the force that causes the surface of a liquid to contract, while viscosity is the resistance to flow. The statement confuses these two distinct properties.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Ethylene glycol is indeed used as an antifreeze, but it's not an alcohol; it's a diol (contains two hydroxyl groups).  Furthermore, its boiling point is higher than water, which is a critical property for its effectiveness as an antifreeze.  The statement contains multiple inaccuracies.

1.  Iron is a diamagnetic material, meaning it is weakly repelled by a magnetic field, while oxygen exhibits paramagnetic behavior, being weakly attracted to a magnetic field.
2.  The average fat content of buffalo milk is approximately 4.5%, significantly lower than that of cow's milk.
3.  Fluorine is the least reactive element among the halogens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Iron is a ferromagnetic material, strongly attracted to a magnetic field. Oxygen is paramagnetic, but the statement incorrectly describes iron's magnetic properties.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The average fat content of buffalo milk is typically higher than 4.5%, often ranging between 7% and 9%.  Cow's milk generally has a lower fat content. The statement underestimates the fat content of buffalo milk.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Fluorine is the *most* reactive element among the halogens, not the least. Its high reactivity is due to its small size and high electronegativity. The statement incorrectly ranks the reactivity of halogens.


**5. With reference to physics principles and applications, consider the following statements:**

1.  When a girl swinging on a swing stands up, the period of the swing will become longer due to a decrease in the effective length of the pendulum.
2.  The working principle of a washing machine is based on dialysis, a process of separating molecules based on their size and charge.
3.  If the numerical values representing the volume and surface area of a cube are equal, then the length of the cube's edge is 6 units.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Standing up reduces the swing's center of gravity, effectively shortening the pendulum's length. A shorter pendulum has a shorter period (faster oscillations). The statement correctly describes the effect on the swing's period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Washing machines operate on the principle of centrifugation, not dialysis. Centrifugation uses rapid spinning to separate heavier particles from lighter ones, while dialysis uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate molecules. The statement misidentifies the washing machine's operating principle.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The volume of a cube is side³, and the surface area is 6 * side². If these are numerically equal, then side³ = 6 * side², which simplifies to side = 6 only if the unit is considered as the length of side.  Therefore, the length of the cube's edge is 6 units. However, the question is poorly phrased and could be interpreted differently.  The statement is imprecise and misleading.

2.  Transformers are exclusively used in direct current (DC) circuits, facilitating the conversion of DC voltage levels.
3.  The efficiency of a transformer is significantly impacted by factors such as core losses (hysteresis and eddy currents) and copper losses (resistance in windings).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Transformers utilize the principle of electromagnetic induction to change AC voltage levels.  A changing magnetic field in the primary coil induces a voltage in the secondary coil, allowing for voltage transformation. Statement 2 is incorrect. Transformers *cannot* work with direct current (DC) because a constant DC current does not produce a changing magnetic field necessary for induction.  Transformers are specifically designed for alternating current (AC) circuits. Statement 3 is correct. The efficiency of a transformer is affected by various losses. Core losses arise from hysteresis (energy loss due to magnetization and demagnetization of the core) and eddy currents (induced currents in the core that dissipate energy as heat). Copper losses occur due to the resistance of the windings, causing energy to be lost as heat.  Minimizing these losses is crucial for designing efficient transformers.


**6. With reference to the sources of proteins, consider the following statements:**

(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Food Security Act, 2013, aims to enhance food security and reduce malnutrition by providing subsidized food grains to a substantial portion of the Indian population. Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act specifies the quantity of food grains to be provided per person per month to eligible households, although the specific quantity varies depending on the category of the household.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Act promotes food fortification, it does not mandate the fortification of *all* staple foods.  The fortification programs are implemented progressively and focus on specific nutrients and food items.


**9. With reference to the effects of high Glycemic Index (GI) foods, consider the following statements:**

1.  High-GI foods cause rapid spikes in blood glucose levels, potentially leading to insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
2.  A diet rich in high-GI foods is associated with increased triglyceride levels and blood pressure, contributing to cardiovascular disease risk.

1.  Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are exclusively used in the production of human insulin.
2.  Recombinant proteins, such as insulin, are examples of biomolecules produced through biotechnology.
3.  The pancreas is the only organ capable of producing insulin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GMOs are used in the production of some pharmaceuticals,  insulin production isn't exclusively reliant on them.  Other methods, such as using bacterial or yeast cultures, are also employed.  The statement presents an oversimplification of a complex biotechnological process.

Statement 2 is correct. Recombinant DNA technology allows scientists to insert the human insulin gene into microorganisms (bacteria or yeast), which then produce large quantities of human insulin. This is a prime example of a biomolecule produced through biotechnology.  The process bypasses the limitations of extracting insulin from animal pancreases.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the pancreas is the primary site of insulin production in humans, other tissues and cells can also produce small amounts of insulin under certain circumstances. This statement overstates the exclusivity of the pancreas in insulin production.  The statement ignores the potential for future biotechnological developments to produce insulin in other systems.


**2. With reference to the role of isotopes in technology and energy production, consider the following statements:**

1.  Plutonium-239 (Pu-239) is primarily formed through nuclear fusion in the Earth's mantle.
2.  The SNAP-10A satellite technology utilized nuclear fission for power generation.
3.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) utilize nuclear fusion for energy production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pu-239 is a product of nuclear fission, not fusion.  It's created in nuclear reactors through the neutron bombardment of uranium-238. The statement incorrectly associates Pu-239 with a fundamentally different nuclear process and a different geological location.

Statement 2 is correct.  SNAP-10A was a pioneering space reactor program that used nuclear fission to generate electricity for satellites.  This represents a significant early application of nuclear technology in space exploration. The statement accurately reflects a historical development in the application of nuclear fission for space-based power.

Statement 3 is incorrect. SMRs utilize nuclear fission, not fusion.  Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun, is still under development as a viable energy source. The statement confuses two distinct nuclear processes and misrepresents the technological basis of SMRs.


**3. With reference to the regulation of glucose homeostasis, consider the following statements:**

1. Insulin, a hormone secreted by the liver, regulates glucose homeostasis.
2. GLP-1 (Glucagon-like peptide-1) decreases the production of insulin.
3.  Glucose homeostasis is the process of maintaining a stable level of glucose in the blood.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While insulin is crucial for glucose homeostasis, it is secreted by the pancreas, not the liver. The liver plays a role in glucose metabolism, but it's not the primary source of insulin. The statement incorrectly attributes insulin secretion to the wrong organ, demonstrating a lack of precision in understanding endocrine function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. GLP-1 actually *increases* insulin production. It's an incretin hormone that enhances insulin release from the pancreas in response to food intake. This statement reverses the actual physiological effect of GLP-1 on insulin secretion.

Statement 3 is correct.  Glucose homeostasis is the precise physiological mechanism that maintains blood glucose levels within a narrow range, essential for cellular function and overall health.  This represents a fundamental concept in physiology and metabolism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a lead plate can *attenuate* (reduce the intensity of) gamma radiation, it does not *detect* it.  Detection requires a specialized instrument capable of measuring the radiation's energy. The statement confuses shielding with detection, reflecting a misunderstanding of radiation physics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Spectrophotometers are used to measure the absorbance and transmission of light, not ionizing radiation like gamma rays.  The statement wrongly associates an instrument for optical measurements with the detection of nuclear radiation.

Statement 3 is correct. Scintillation counters are specifically designed to detect and measure gamma radiation and other ionizing radiation.  They work by converting the energy of gamma rays into light pulses, which are then counted electronically.  This statement accurately identifies a key instrument used in radiation detection.

Statement 2 is correct. Although India is a significant producer of oilseeds, it is a net importer of edible oils.  This dependence on imports, particularly of palm oil and soybean oil, makes it vulnerable to global price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions.  The statement accurately reflects this vulnerability.

Statement 3 is correct.  India's push towards organic farming is a significant initiative aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture and improving farmer incomes.  However, challenges remain in terms of streamlined certification procedures, ensuring fair market access for organic products, and achieving widespread farmer participation.

Therefore, all three statements are correct.

**1. Consider the following statements about Genome Editing:**

1. CRISPR-Cas9 is a type of genome editing technology that utilizes site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to make precise changes in DNA sequences.
2.  SDN1 and SDN2 genome editing methods always involve the introduction of foreign genetic material into the target organism's genome.
3. The development of low-pungent mustard through gene editing involved modifying the glucosinolate content to levels comparable to Canola.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is also correct. The kingdom Monera comprises prokaryotic organisms, meaning their cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles.  Bacteria and archaea are the primary groups within Monera.

Statement 3 is true. Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic organisms, typically found in aquatic habitats. They exhibit diverse modes of nutrition and locomotion, and play significant roles in aquatic ecosystems.  While some protozoa can be found in other environments, their prevalence in aquatic ecosystems is a defining characteristic.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the characteristics of plant cells, consider the following statements:**

1.  Plant cells possess a cell wall composed primarily of cellulose, providing structural support and protection.
2.  Chloroplasts, the sites of photosynthesis, are enclosed by a double membrane system, reflecting their endosymbiotic origin.
3.  The nucleus, containing the genetic material, lacks a surrounding membrane in plant cells, unlike animal cells.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Plant cells are distinguished by the presence of a rigid cell wall, primarily composed of cellulose. This cell wall provides structural support, maintains cell shape, and protects the cell from mechanical damage and osmotic stress.

Statement 2 is also correct. Chloroplasts, responsible for photosynthesis, are indeed bounded by a double membrane. This double membrane structure is a key feature supporting the endosymbiotic theory, which proposes that chloroplasts originated from an ancient symbiotic relationship between a eukaryotic cell and a photosynthetic bacterium.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The nucleus in plant cells, like in animal cells, is enclosed by a double membrane known as the nuclear envelope.  This membrane regulates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, ensuring the proper functioning of the genetic material. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**3. With reference to the properties of starch and glycogen, consider the following statements:**

1.  Starch, a principal energy storage polysaccharide in plants, is composed of amylose and amylopectin.
2.  Glycogen, the main storage carbohydrate in animals, is more extensively branched than starch, facilitating rapid glucose release.
3.  Both starch and glycogen are insoluble in water, preventing osmotic imbalances within cells.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Starch, the primary energy storage form in plants, is a complex carbohydrate consisting of two main components: amylose (a linear chain) and amylopectin (a branched chain).  The relative proportions of amylose and amylopectin can vary depending on the plant source.

Statement 2 is also correct. Glycogen, the main storage polysaccharide in animals (and fungi), is indeed more highly branched than starch.  This extensive branching provides numerous points for enzyme action, allowing for rapid mobilization of glucose when energy is needed.

Statement 3 is true. Both starch and glycogen are insoluble in water. This insolubility is crucial for their function as storage molecules; if they were soluble, they would exert osmotic pressure and disrupt the cell's water balance.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**4. With reference to the effects of a short circuit in an electrical circuit, consider the following statements:**

1. A short circuit results in a significant decrease in the circuit's resistance.
2. The current flowing through the circuit drastically increases during a short circuit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A short circuit occurs when there is an unintended low-resistance path between two points of different potential in a circuit. This drastically reduces the overall resistance of the circuit.

Statement 2 is also correct.  According to Ohm's Law (V=IR), if the voltage remains constant and the resistance decreases significantly (as in a short circuit), the current (I) will increase dramatically.  This surge in current can be dangerous, potentially causing overheating and damage to components or even fires.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While a short circuit might *seem* to reduce voltage due to a blown fuse or circuit breaker tripping, the initial effect is not a reduction in voltage across the short itself. The voltage across the short remains close to the source voltage until the protective device interrupts the circuit.  The voltage elsewhere in the circuit might drop due to the interruption. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**5. With reference to the principles and applications of electricity, consider the following statements:**

Electric generators utilize the principle of electromagnetic induction, where the movement of a conductor within a magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF), generating an electric current. This is the fundamental principle behind the operation of most power plants.

Statement 2 is also correct.  In a long, straight solenoid (a coil of wire), the magnetic field lines inside are nearly uniform, parallel, and straight when the current flows through it. This is a well-established result in electromagnetism.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  In household wiring, green insulation typically designates the earth wire (ground wire), not the neutral wire. The neutral wire usually has blue or black insulation.  The earth wire provides a safety path for fault currents, preventing electric shock. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**6. With reference to the law of gravitation, consider the following statements:**

1. Doubling the mass of one object while keeping the distance constant would double the gravitational force between two objects.
2. Doubling the distance between two objects while keeping their masses constant would reduce the gravitational force to one-fourth.
3. The gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that the gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the masses.  Therefore, doubling one mass while keeping the distance constant would indeed double the force.

Statement 2 is also correct. The gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.  Doubling the distance would reduce the force by a factor of (1/2)² = 1/4.

Statement 3 is a correct statement of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. It accurately describes the relationship between gravitational force, mass, and distance. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**7. With reference to the measurement of weight, consider the following statements:**

1. Weight is a measure of the gravitational force acting on an object.
2. An object's weight would increase proportionally to the acceleration due to gravity.
3. An object weighing 9 N on Earth would weigh 81 N on a planet with 9 times Earth's gravitational acceleration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Weight is defined as the force of gravity acting on an object's mass.  It's a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction (towards the center of the gravitating body).

Statement 2 is also correct. Weight (W) is directly proportional to the acceleration due to gravity (g) (W = mg, where m is mass). Therefore, if 'g' increases, the weight increases proportionally.

Statement 3 is correct. If an object weighs 9 N on Earth, and the gravitational acceleration on another planet is 9 times greater, the object's weight on that planet would be 9 * 9 N = 81 N.  This is a direct application of the weight formula.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**8. With reference to the phenomenon of twinkling stars, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While scattering does play a minor role in the overall dimming of starlight, it's not the primary cause of twinkling. Twinkling is primarily a result of the bending of light.

Statement 2 is correct. Atmospheric refraction is the main reason stars twinkle. As starlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, it encounters layers of air with varying densities and refractive indices. This causes the light to bend slightly and continuously, resulting in variations in the apparent brightness and position of the star, creating the twinkling effect.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the apparent position of a star does shift slightly due to atmospheric effects, this shift is not the primary cause of the twinkling effect. The rapid fluctuations in brightness are the more prominent characteristic. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**1. With reference to mRNA vaccines, consider the following statements:**

1.  mRNA vaccines, unlike traditional vaccines, do not involve growing the virus or bacteria.
2.  mRNA vaccines are generally less stable than traditional vaccines and require very cold storage.
3.  mRNA vaccines inject the mRNA directly into the body, bypassing the need for a delivery system like electroporation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Traditional vaccines often utilize weakened or inactivated pathogens (viruses or bacteria) to stimulate an immune response. mRNA vaccines, however, work by delivering messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding a viral protein. The recipient's cells then produce this protein, triggering an immune response without the need to cultivate the actual pathogen.  This significantly reduces the development time and complexity of vaccine production.

Statement 2 is correct.  mRNA is inherently less stable than other vaccine components, making it susceptible to degradation.  This necessitates the use of very cold storage temperatures (typically ultra-low freezers) to maintain vaccine efficacy.  Traditional vaccines, depending on their formulation, may have greater stability and less stringent storage requirements.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While some mRNA vaccines might be injected directly, many require a delivery system to enhance their uptake and efficacy.  Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are commonly used to encapsulate the mRNA, protecting it from degradation and facilitating its entry into cells. Electroporation, a technique that uses electrical pulses to create temporary pores in cell membranes, can also be employed to deliver mRNA more effectively.  Therefore, direct injection without any delivery system is not the norm for all mRNA vaccines.


**2. With reference to the immune system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Passive immunity is a type of immunity acquired through the transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells from an immune host.
2.  Natural immunity is developed artificially through medical procedures such as vaccination.
3.  Humoral immunity is mediated by T cells and involves the destruction of infected cells.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Passive immunity provides temporary protection by transferring pre-formed antibodies or activated T cells from a donor (e.g., mother to fetus, through antibody transfer). This contrasts with active immunity, where the body actively produces its own antibodies in response to an antigen.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Natural immunity is acquired through natural processes like maternal antibody transfer or infection. Artificial immunity is deliberately induced through medical interventions such as vaccination.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Humoral immunity involves antibodies produced by B cells that neutralize pathogens in the body fluids. Cellular immunity, on the other hand, is mediated by T cells, which directly attack infected cells.  The statement incorrectly attributes the function of cellular immunity to humoral immunity.


**3. With reference to mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT), consider the following statements:**

1.  Pronuclear transfer (PNT) involves transferring the mother's nucleus to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, before fertilization.
2.  Maternal spindle transfer (MST) involves fertilizing both the mother's egg and a donor egg before transferring the pronuclei.
3.  MRT is primarily used to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from mother to child.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Pronuclear transfer (PNT) involves fertilizing both the mother's egg and a donor egg *before* transferring the pronuclei (containing the genetic material from both parents). Maternal spindle transfer (MST), on the other hand, involves removing and transferring the *nucleus* from the mother's egg to a donor egg *before* fertilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Maternal spindle transfer (MST) does *not* involve fertilization before the transfer.  The nucleus is transferred first, then the resulting egg is fertilized.

Statement 3 is correct. MRT aims to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases, which are caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA.  By replacing faulty mitochondria with healthy ones, the risk of passing on these diseases to offspring is significantly reduced.


**4. With reference to Tuberculosis (TB) and its treatment, consider the following statements:**

1.  Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, while extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to all first- and second-line drugs.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyan (PMTBMBA) aims to eliminate TB by 2030, and the Nikshay Poshan Yojana provides nutritional support to TB patients.
3.  BPaL, a six-month, all-oral, three-drug regimen, is used to treat people with MDR-TB and includes pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MDR-TB is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin.  XDR-TB is resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, plus a fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs; it is not resistant to *all* first- and second-line drugs.  TDR-TB is the designation for resistance to all first- and second-line drugs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PMTBMBA aims to eliminate TB by 2025, not 2030.  Nikshay Poshan Yojana does indeed provide nutritional support to TB patients.

Statement 3 is correct. BPaL is a six-month, all-oral regimen used to treat XDR-TB, not MDR-TB, and contains pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid.


**5. With reference to Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), consider the following statements:**

1.  SCD is a genetic condition characterized by a modification in the shape of red blood cells from a smooth, doughnut shape into a crescent shape, impairing blood flow.
2.  The National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission aims to provide affordable and accessible care and eliminate SCD by 2047, focusing on the 0-18 age group initially.
3.  A recent study showed that chondrocytes, cells that make cartilage, do not produce haemoglobin, contradicting previous understanding.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SCD is a genetic blood disorder where the red blood cells are misshapen (sickle-shaped) due to abnormal hemoglobin, leading to impaired blood flow and various health complications.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission aims to provide accessible care and eliminate SCD before 2047, focusing on the 0-18 age group initially, but with plans to expand coverage up to age 40.

Statement 3 is incorrect. A recent study showed that chondrocytes *do* produce haemoglobin, challenging the earlier understanding that haemoglobin production was limited to red blood cells.


**6. With reference to Rare Diseases and their treatment, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021, categorizes rare diseases into three groups based on the cost and type of treatment required.
2.  The NPRD, 2021, provides financial assistance only for Group 1 disorders (amenable to one-time curative treatment).
3.  Exemption from Basic Customs Duty is granted for all rare disease drugs imported for personal use, regardless of the disease category.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NPRD, 2021, categorizes rare diseases into three groups based on treatment cost and type, to guide treatment strategies and financial assistance programs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NPRD provides financial assistance, it's not limited to only Group 1 disorders.  Support is provided across all three groups, though the level and type of support vary based on the disease category.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While exemption from Basic Customs Duty is provided for rare disease drugs for personal use, it's not granted for all categories. The exemption is subject to certain conditions and may not apply universally.


**7. With reference to Generic Drugs and their regulation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, mandate that doctors prescribe drugs using only generic names, legibly written in capital letters.
2.  The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, allow pharmacies to sell only the branded versions of drugs even if the prescription specifies the generic names.
3.  The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes retail prices for essential medicines, including generic drugs, under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Medical Council regulations encourage the use of generic names in prescriptions to promote affordability and rational drug use.  While not strictly enforcing capital letters universally, the emphasis is on clear and unambiguous prescription of generic names.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, do not prevent pharmacies from selling generic medicines if the prescription specifies the generic name.  In fact, the rules encourage the use of generic names and allow substitution with equivalent generic drugs, unless the doctor specifically prohibits substitution.

Statement 3 is correct. NPPA plays a crucial role in regulating the prices of essential medicines, including generic drugs, under the purview of the DPCO, 2013, ensuring affordability and accessibility.


**8. With reference to the discovery of the Higgs boson decaying into a Z boson and a photon, consider the following statements:**

1.  This rare decay process, observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), provides evidence for particles beyond those predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics.
2.  The Standard Model of particle physics explains all four fundamental forces of nature: strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational.
3.  The Higgs boson, a scalar particle with zero spin, has a very short lifetime and typically decays into pairs of photons or pairs of W or Z bosons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The observation of this rare decay mode of the Higgs boson is significant as it could hint at new physics beyond the Standard Model, potentially indicating the existence of yet-undiscovered particles or interactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Standard Model successfully describes three of the four fundamental forces (strong, weak, and electromagnetic), but it does not incorporate gravity.  The search for a theory of quantum gravity that unifies all four forces remains a major challenge in physics.

Statement 3 is correct. The Higgs boson is a scalar particle (spin 0), and its short lifetime leads to its rapid decay into other particles, most commonly pairs of photons or W/Z bosons.  The observation of its decay into a Z boson and a photon is a rarer event.


**9. With reference to Superconductivity, consider the following statements:**

1.  Superconductivity is a phenomenon observed only at extremely low temperatures, near absolute zero.
2.  The Meissner effect refers to the generation of a magnetic field within a superconductor when cooled below its critical temperature.
3.  Materials exhibiting superconductivity have zero electrical resistance and expel magnetic fields below a critical temperature (Tc).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While superconductivity was initially observed only at extremely low temperatures, research has led to the discovery of materials that exhibit superconductivity at higher temperatures, though still significantly below room temperature.  The search for room-temperature superconductors is an active area of research.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Meissner effect describes the *expulsion* of a magnetic field from a superconductor, not the generation of a magnetic field, when cooled below its critical temperature.  This expulsion is a hallmark of the superconducting state.

Statement 3 is correct.  Superconductivity is characterized by both zero electrical resistance and the complete expulsion of magnetic fields (Meissner effect) when the material is cooled below its critical temperature (Tc).


**10. With reference to Plant Tissue Culture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Plant tissue culture is based on the totipotency of plant cells, meaning that a single cell can develop into an entire plant.
2.  Organ culture involves using seeds as explants for culturing purposes.
3.  Plant tissue culture is primarily used for propagating and improving commercially valuable plants, with limited applications in scientific research.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Plant tissue culture leverages the totipotency of plant cells—their ability to differentiate into any type of plant cell and regenerate a whole plant from a single cell or tissue.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Organ culture uses plant organs (roots, stems, leaves, etc.) as explants, not seeds. Seed culture is a separate technique.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While plant tissue culture is widely used for commercial plant propagation and improvement, it also plays a significant role in various scientific research areas, including plant genetics, physiology, and biotechnology.  It allows for controlled experiments under sterile conditions.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the impact of various factors on human lungs, consider the following statements:**

1.  Exposure to high concentrations of mercury vapor can lead to severe lung damage, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis.
2.  Sickle cell disease primarily affects red blood cells and does not directly cause significant damage to the lungs.
3.  Pulmonary tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that specifically targets the lungs, causing tissue destruction and impairing respiratory function.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mercury, in its vapor form, is highly toxic and can cause significant damage to the lungs.  Inhalation leads to mercury accumulation, triggering an inflammatory response and potentially resulting in lung fibrosis (scarring).  This is a well-established occupational hazard in industries handling mercury.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While sickle cell disease primarily affects red blood cells, leading to vaso-occlusive crises (blockage of blood vessels), it can indirectly impact the lungs.  The impaired blood flow can cause acute chest syndrome, a severe complication involving lung inflammation and infection.  However, the statement claims it does *not* directly cause significant lung damage, which is an oversimplification.

Statement 3 is correct. Pulmonary tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection that specifically targets the lungs.  The bacteria, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, invade lung tissue, causing granulomas (nodules of immune cells) and potentially leading to cavity formation, significant tissue damage, and respiratory compromise. This is a primary characteristic of the disease.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the production and applications of yeast, consider the following statements:**

1. Molasses, a byproduct of sugar refining, is a crucial substrate for industrial yeast production, providing the necessary carbon source for fermentation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While yeast is indeed crucial in baking as a leavening agent (producing carbon dioxide), its role in biofuel production is significant.  Specifically, certain yeast strains are highly efficient in converting sugars into ethanol through fermentation, making them a key component of bioethanol production processes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although bacteria can produce ethanol, yeast is a major player in industrial ethanol production, particularly for biofuels. The process is not exclusive to bacteria; yeast fermentation is a widely used and efficient method for ethanol production. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to the process of photosynthesis and its role in ecological processes, consider the following statements:**

1. Autotrophic succession in terrestrial ecosystems is primarily driven by the colonization and growth of heterotrophic organisms, which are responsible for soil formation and nutrient cycling.
2. Green plants, through photosynthesis, convert light energy into chemical energy stored in energy-rich organic compounds like glucose, forming the base of most food chains.
3. The process of photosynthesis occurs exclusively in the chloroplasts of plant cells and is not observed in any other organisms.

They are the pioneers in establishing a new ecosystem,  gradually changing the environment to support more complex life forms. Heterotrophs play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, but the primary driver of succession is the autotrophic community.

Statement 2 is correct. Photosynthesis is the fundamental process by which green plants (and some other organisms) convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of organic compounds like glucose. This process forms the base of most food chains, providing energy for the entire ecosystem.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While chloroplasts are the primary site of photosynthesis in plants, the process itself is not exclusive to plants.  Photosynthetic mechanisms are found in various other organisms, including some bacteria and protists (algae).  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**4.  With reference to nuclear fission and its applications, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nuclear fission is a process involving the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy.
2.  The isotope Uranium-235 (235U) is not fissile and cannot sustain a chain reaction in a nuclear reactor.
3.  Nuclear fusion is a process where two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a significant amount of energy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus (like uranium or plutonium) into smaller nuclei. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy due to the mass defect (difference in mass between the original nucleus and the resulting nuclei).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Uranium-235 (235U) is indeed fissile, meaning it can undergo nuclear fission and sustain a chain reaction. This property is crucial for the operation of nuclear reactors and the creation of nuclear weapons.

Statement 3 is correct. Nuclear fusion is the opposite of fission; it involves combining two lighter nuclei (like isotopes of hydrogen) to form a heavier nucleus (like helium). This process also releases a large amount of energy, even greater than fission, but requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to initiate.


**5. With reference to the concept of pressure and its applications, consider the following statements:**

1. The pressure exerted by a human body on sand is significantly greater when lying down compared to standing up.
2. In meteorology, isobars on a weather map represent lines connecting points of equal temperature.
3. Atmospheric pressure generally decreases with increasing altitude due to the decreasing density of air at higher elevations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pressure is force per unit area. When standing, the body's weight is distributed over a smaller area (the soles of the feet), resulting in higher pressure on the sand. When lying down, the weight is distributed over a larger area, resulting in lower pressure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Isobars are lines connecting points of equal atmospheric pressure, not temperature.  Isotherms represent lines of equal temperature.

Statement 3 is correct. Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the air column above a given point.  As altitude increases, the mass of air above decreases, leading to a reduction in atmospheric pressure.  This is a fundamental principle in meteorology.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of fertilizers on the environment:**

1.  Fertilizers, primarily classified under the 'Red category' industry, significantly contribute to groundwater contamination.
2.  Nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, is a byproduct of fertilizer production and application, contributing to climate change.
3.  The Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) scheme aims to mitigate the negative environmental impacts associated with fertilizer overuse.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Fertilizers are indeed linked to groundwater contamination through leaching of excess nitrogen and phosphorus.  The "Red category" classification points to the potential environmental risks associated with fertilizer production and use.  Extensive research shows a strong correlation between fertilizer application and nitrate contamination of groundwater resources.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a significant greenhouse gas emitted during the production and use of nitrogen-based fertilizers. The nitrogen cycle, particularly the processes of nitrification and denitrification in soil, release N2O into the atmosphere. This gas has a much higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the NBS (Nutrient Based Subsidy) scheme aims to promote balanced fertilizer use and improve nutrient use efficiency, it does not directly address the broader environmental impacts like groundwater contamination or N2O emissions.  The scheme primarily focuses on affordability and availability of fertilizers but lacks specific mechanisms to fully mitigate the environmental consequences.  The focus is primarily on the economic aspect of fertilizer use, not the environmental one.


**2. With reference to the chemical composition and effects of fertilizers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Urea, a common fertilizer, is primarily composed of nitrogen and contributes significantly to nitrogen pollution.
2.  Fertilizers containing phosphorus are crucial for plant growth but contribute to eutrophication in water bodies.
3.  Potassium, a vital nutrient for plants, is generally not a major source of environmental pollution associated with fertilizer use.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Urea [(NH2)2CO] is a nitrogen-rich fertilizer.  Its extensive use has led to significant nitrogen pollution in many regions due to runoff and leaching into water bodies.  Excess nitrogen can cause eutrophication and harm aquatic ecosystems.

Statement 2 is correct.  Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants, but excessive phosphorus from fertilizers causes eutrophication in water bodies.  The excess nutrients lead to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and the death of aquatic life.  This process significantly degrades water quality.

Statement 3 is correct.  Although potassium is an essential macronutrient for plant growth, its environmental impact relative to nitrogen and phosphorus is generally less severe.  Potassium fertilizers do not contribute significantly to eutrophication or other major environmental pollution problems associated with fertilizer use.


**3. With reference to the sources and applications of fertilizers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Atmospheric nitrogen is a primary source of nitrogen used in the production of fertilizers.
2.  Fertilizers are crucial agricultural inputs that increase agricultural yields but may damage soil health through overuse.
3.  The Paradip Port is a significant import point for fertilizers in India, highlighting the country's dependence on imported fertilizers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Haber-Bosch process, a crucial industrial process, converts atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3), a key building block for many nitrogen-containing fertilizers.  This process is energy-intensive and relies on fossil fuels.

Statement 2 is correct.  Fertilizers are essential for boosting crop yields, but their overuse can lead to soil degradation.  This includes issues like soil acidification, nutrient imbalances, and reduced soil biodiversity.  Sustainable fertilizer management practices are essential for maintaining soil health.

Statement 3 is correct.  Paradip Port is a major entry point for fertilizer imports into India.  This underscores the reliance on imported fertilizers to meet the country's agricultural demands.  The import dependency highlights the need for enhancing domestic fertilizer production capacity.


**4. Consider the following statements about the nutrients typically found in fertilizers:**

1.  Iron is a micronutrient typically available in commercially produced fertilizers.
2.  Sulphur is a secondary macronutrient often included in fertilizers to improve crop yields and quality.
3.  While nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are macronutrients, their ratios in fertilizers are not always optimal for specific soil and crop needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Iron is a micronutrient essential for plant growth, but it is usually not a major component of commercially produced fertilizers.  Iron deficiencies are typically addressed through soil amendments or specialized iron chelates, not through standard NPK fertilizers.

Statement 2 is correct. Sulphur is a secondary macronutrient that plays a significant role in plant metabolism. Many fertilizers contain sulphur either as a primary component or as a byproduct of other nutrient sources.  Its presence enhances nutrient uptake and improves overall crop health.

Statement 3 is correct.  While NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) fertilizers are widely used, the optimal NPK ratio varies greatly depending on soil type, crop requirements, and environmental conditions.  Improper ratios can lead to nutrient imbalances and reduced efficiency, highlighting the importance of soil testing and tailored fertilizer application.

**1. With reference to genetic engineering and biotechnology, consider the following statements:**

1.  Recombinant human insulin, primarily used in the treatment of diabetes, is produced using *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* as a host organism.
2.  The phloem tissue in plants is responsible for the efficient translocation of synthesized organic compounds, including nano-urea, a recently developed nitrogen fertilizer.
3.  Haemophilia A, a genetic disorder characterized by impaired blood clotting, is inherited through the Y chromosome.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Recombinant human insulin is predominantly produced using *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) bacteria, not *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast). While yeast is used in some biotechnological processes, *E. coli* is a more commonly employed bacterial host for insulin production due to its rapid growth rate, ease of genetic manipulation, and high yield.

Statement 2 is correct. Phloem tissue, a part of the vascular system in plants, is primarily responsible for transporting the products of photosynthesis (sugars, amino acids, etc.) throughout the plant.  Nano-urea, being a form of nitrogen fertilizer, would be transported via the phloem as it is a nutrient for plant growth,  similar to other organic compounds.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Haemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means the faulty gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome.  Males, having only one X chromosome, are more severely affected than females, who have two X chromosomes (one of which may carry the normal gene). The Y chromosome does not carry the gene for Haemophilia A.


**2. With reference to human genetics and chromosomal inheritance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Long-read sequencing technologies are extensively used to analyze the relatively small size and gene-poor nature of the X chromosome in humans.
2.  The presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome is the primary determinant of male sex development in humans.
3.  The Y chromosome is inherited exclusively from the mother, contributing to maternal lineage tracing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Y chromosome, while smaller than the X chromosome, is not necessarily gene-poor.  It contains important genes for male sex determination and other functions.  Long-read sequencing is more useful for resolving complex, repetitive regions of the genome, which are more prevalent in larger chromosomes like the X chromosome. The statement misrepresents the relative sizes and gene content of X and Y chromosomes, and the application of long-read sequencing.

Statement 2 is correct. The SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene on the Y chromosome plays a crucial role in initiating the development of the male phenotype in humans.  Its presence triggers a cascade of developmental events leading to testes formation and the production of testosterone, influencing the development of male secondary sexual characteristics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Y chromosome is inherited paternally (from the father), not maternally.  Maternal lineage is typically traced using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is inherited exclusively from the mother.  The statement misrepresents the inheritance pattern of the Y chromosome.


**3. With reference to the mechanisms of action of antibiotics and their effects on bacterial cells, consider the following statements:**

1.  Penicillin, a β-lactam antibiotic, primarily inhibits protein synthesis in bacterial cells by binding to bacterial ribosomes.
2.  The bacterium *Penicillium* is a source of penicillin, a widely used antibiotic.
3.  Penicillin’s mode of action involves disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to cell lysis and bacterial death.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Penicillin does not primarily inhibit protein synthesis.  Protein synthesis inhibitors are a different class of antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines, aminoglycosides). Penicillin's mechanism of action targets cell wall synthesis.

Statement 2 is correct.  *Penicillium* species of fungi are the natural producers of penicillin.  This antibiotic is then extracted and purified for medicinal use.

Statement 3 is correct. Penicillin interferes with the synthesis of peptidoglycans, essential components of bacterial cell walls.  This disruption weakens the cell wall, leading to cell lysis (rupture) and ultimately bacterial death.


**4. With reference to the properties and applications of X-rays and other electromagnetic radiations, consider the following statements:**

1.  X-rays are a type of ionizing radiation, capable of causing ionization in matter due to their high energy.
2.  Electromagnetic waves used in satellite communication are primarily in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
3.  X-rays, unlike visible light, are not deflected by magnetic fields because they are not charged particles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, meaning they have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms, creating ions. This ionizing property is what makes them useful in medical imaging (radiography) but also potentially harmful.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Satellite communication primarily utilizes radio waves, specifically microwaves, within the radio frequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Infrared radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and is not suitable for long-distance communication in space.

Statement 3 is correct. X-rays are electromagnetic waves, not charged particles.  Magnetic fields only deflect charged particles, such as electrons or protons.  Electromagnetic waves are unaffected by magnetic fields.


**5. With reference to physics and energy, consider the following statements:**

1.  If the linear momentum of a moving object is doubled, its kinetic energy increases by a factor of four.
2.  The gravitational force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.
3.  Neutrons, unlike protons, are electrically neutral subatomic particles found within the atomic nucleus, and they revolve around the nucleus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kinetic energy (KE) is related to momentum (p) by the equation KE = p²/2m, where m is the mass.  If momentum is doubled (2p), the kinetic energy becomes (2p)²/2m = 4p²/2m, which is four times the original kinetic energy.

Statement 2 is correct. Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that the gravitational force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Doubling the distance reduces the gravitational force to one-quarter of its original value.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While neutrons are electrically neutral and reside within the atomic nucleus (along with protons), they do *not* revolve around the nucleus.  The electrons are the particles that orbit the nucleus.  The statement incorrectly describes the behavior of neutrons within an atom.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NSR classifies robots into industrial, service, *and medical* categories. Statement 2 is incorrect as well; while MeitY plays a significant role, other agencies and ministries may also be involved in the implementation of the NSR. Statement 3 is correct; Telangana was indeed the first state to have a dedicated robotics framework. The question attempts to mislead by omitting a key category in the classification and overstating MeitY's role.


**4.  With reference to the properties and applications of Tantalum, consider the following statements:**

1. Tantalum is a common metal with a low melting point, making it easy to work with.
2. Tantalum's high corrosion resistance makes it unsuitable for use in chemical processing equipment.
3.  Tantalum's high melting point makes it a potential substitute for Platinum in some applications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; tantalum is a *rare* metal with an *extremely high* melting point. Statement 2 is incorrect because its high corrosion resistance makes it *ideal* for chemical processing equipment. Statement 3 is correct; the high melting point and relatively lower cost compared to platinum make tantalum a viable substitute in certain applications. The question uses contrasting properties (common vs. rare, low vs. high melting point) to create confusion.


**5. With reference to the characteristics of Neutrinos, consider the following statements:**

1. Neutrinos are fundamental particles that are a constituent part of atoms.
2. Neutrinos travel at the speed of light and interact extensively with matter.
3.  Neutrino oscillation is the process by which neutrinos change from one type to another as they travel.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while neutrinos are fundamental particles, they are *not* part of atoms. Statement 2 is incorrect; neutrinos travel *almost* at the speed of light and interact *rarely* with matter. Statement 3 is correct; neutrino oscillation is a well-established phenomenon. The question plays on the subtle differences in the descriptions of neutrino properties (speed, interaction with matter) to create plausible distractors.


**6. With reference to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), consider the following statements:**

1. JWST is a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and operates primarily in the visible light spectrum.
2.  JWST's observations have challenged aspects of the standard model of cosmology by revealing fully formed galaxies earlier than predicted.
3.  JWST is a solely NASA-led project.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; JWST is a successor to HST but operates primarily in the infrared spectrum, not visible light. Statement 2 is correct; JWST's observations have indeed challenged the standard model.

Statement 2 is correct; storing and transporting hydrogen efficiently is a major challenge. Statement 3 is incorrect; tritium *is* a fuel used in nuclear fusion. The question uses the sources of hydrogen and its role in fusion to create misleading options.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the hydrological cycle, consider the following statements:**

1. Evaporation from oceans is the primary source of atmospheric water vapor, exceeding that from continents.
2.  The rate of evaporation from saline water bodies is significantly higher than that from freshwater bodies due to lower boiling points.
3. Increased evaporation directly leads to a decrease in relative humidity and a rise in the saturation point.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Oceans cover a much larger surface area than continents and contribute the majority of water vapor to the atmosphere through evaporation. This is a fundamental aspect of the hydrological cycle.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The rate of evaporation from freshwater is actually higher than from saltwater due to the higher salinity of seawater.  Salinity increases the boiling point and reduces the rate of evaporation.  The lower vapor pressure of saltwater reduces the escaping tendency of water molecules.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Increased evaporation increases the amount of water vapor in the air, thereby increasing relative humidity. The saturation point, the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at a given temperature, is not directly affected by the rate of evaporation; temperature is the primary factor influencing it.


**2. With reference to the factors influencing evaporation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Water availability is the sole determinant of evaporation rates, irrespective of other environmental conditions.
2.  Higher air pressure significantly increases the rate of evaporation by promoting the escape of water molecules.
3. Plants, due to their transpiration processes, contribute to a faster rate of evaporation compared to bare soil.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While water availability is crucial, other factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure also significantly influence evaporation rates.  It's not a sole determinant.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Higher air pressure actually *decreases* the rate of evaporation. Increased pressure hinders the escape of water molecules from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase.

Statement 3 is correct. Plants actively transpire, releasing water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves. This process significantly increases the overall rate of evaporation from a vegetated surface compared to bare soil.


**3. With reference to the concept of Isobars and related meteorological phenomena, consider the following statements:**

1. Isobars on a weather map directly indicate wind speed and direction.
2. The pressure gradient force, responsible for wind generation, is inversely proportional to the spacing between isobars.
3. Geostrophic winds, a simplified model of upper-level winds, flow parallel to isobars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Isobars show lines of equal pressure. Wind speed and direction are determined by the pressure gradient (spacing between isobars) and the Coriolis effect (Earth's rotation), not just the isobars themselves.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The pressure gradient force is *directly* proportional to the spacing between isobars. Closer isobars indicate a steeper pressure gradient and stronger winds.

Statement 3 is correct. Geostrophic winds are a theoretical model assuming a balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force.  In this simplified model, winds flow parallel to isobars at higher altitudes where friction is minimal.


**4. With reference to the geographical distribution of Gold and Silver in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bihar is the largest producer of gold in India, followed by Rajasthan.
2.  Significant silver deposits are found co-occurring with gold deposits in Rajasthan and Karnataka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While both Bihar and Rajasthan have gold deposits, neither is the largest producer in India.  Karnataka and other states have historically had larger gold production.

Statement 2 is correct. Gold and silver frequently occur together in geological formations.  Rajasthan and Karnataka are known to have such co-occurring deposits.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The KGF are historically and presently more famous for their gold production, not silver, although some silver is extracted as a byproduct.


**5.  With reference to the properties and applications of Cotton, consider the following statements:**

1. Cotton is primarily a Kharif crop, with sowing typically commencing in April-May across all Indian regions.
2.  Cotton requires high water consumption, making it a water-intensive crop, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.
3. The Regur soil, also known as black cotton soil, is unsuitable for cotton cultivation due to its high clay content.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While cotton is a Kharif crop, sowing times vary significantly depending on the region and irrigation availability.  April-May is applicable only to some regions, not all.

Statement 2 is correct. Cotton is indeed a water-intensive crop, requiring substantial irrigation, especially in regions with limited rainfall.  Water scarcity often limits cotton production.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Regur soil, with its high clay content and water retention capacity, is actually quite suitable for cotton cultivation, especially in the Deccan Plateau region.


**6. With reference to Hydrogen as an energy source, consider the following statements:**

1.  Hydrogen production from natural gas is a carbon-neutral process.
2.  The National Hydrogen Mission in India primarily focuses on promoting hydrogen fuel cell technology for transportation.
3.  Hydrogen possesses a higher energy density compared to conventional fossil fuels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Hydrogen production from natural gas (through steam methane reforming) is *not* carbon-neutral; it releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the National Hydrogen Mission aims to promote various hydrogen technologies, its scope is broader than just transportation; it includes industrial applications and energy storage.

Statement 3 is correct.  On a mass basis, hydrogen has a much higher energy density than fossil fuels, meaning it stores more energy per unit mass.  However, its volumetric energy density (energy per unit volume) is lower, creating storage and transportation challenges.


**7. With reference to Sulphur and its occurrence, consider the following statements:**

1. Sulphur is primarily found in igneous rocks like granite and basalt.
2.  Pyrite, a common iron sulfide mineral, is a significant source of commercially extractable sulphur.
3. Petroleum refineries are a major source of elemental sulphur as a byproduct of oil processing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Sulphur is not primarily found in igneous rocks. It is commonly found in sedimentary rocks, evaporites, and as a component of sulfide minerals.

Statement 2 is correct. Pyrite (FeS2) is a major source of sulphur.  Roasting pyrite to extract sulphur is a common industrial process.

Statement 3 is correct.  Petroleum refineries often recover substantial amounts of sulphur as a byproduct during oil refining.  This sulphur is then processed for various industrial uses.


**8. With reference to Phosphorus and its role in the environment, consider the following statements:**

1.  Phosphorus is a crucial nutrient for plant growth but does not play a significant role in the nitrogen cycle.
2.  Excessive phosphorus runoff from agricultural lands is a major contributor to eutrophication in water bodies.
3.  Phosphate rocks are the primary source of phosphorus for fertilizer production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While phosphorus is vital for plant growth, it is also indirectly involved in the nitrogen cycle through its impact on microbial communities that fix nitrogen.

Statement 2 is correct.  Excessive phosphorus from fertilizers and other sources leads to eutrophication – excessive algal growth that depletes oxygen and harms aquatic life.

Statement 3 is correct. Phosphate rocks are the primary source of phosphorus used in the production of phosphate fertilizers.  These rocks are mined and processed to extract phosphorus.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to photosynthesis and respiration, consider the following statements:**

1.  Photosynthesis converts light energy into potential energy stored in organic molecules, primarily carbohydrates.
2.  Magnesium (Mg) is an essential element for respiration, acting as a cofactor in several enzymes involved in the process.
3.  Energy loss in an ecosystem is primarily due to the process of photosynthesis, which dissipates energy as heat.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll.  This process converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose, a type of potential energy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While magnesium is crucial for chlorophyll synthesis, which is essential for photosynthesis, it is not directly involved in the enzymatic processes of respiration. Respiration uses various coenzymes and cofactors, but magnesium's primary role is in photosynthesis.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Energy loss in an ecosystem is primarily due to respiration, not photosynthesis. Respiration is a metabolic process that releases energy stored in organic molecules.  A significant portion of this energy is lost as heat during cellular respiration. Photosynthesis, on the other hand, *stores* energy.


**2. With reference to the role of DNA in biological processes, consider the following statements:**

1.  Histone proteins wrap around RNA molecules, forming the structural basis of chromosomes.
2.  Guide RNA (gRNA) is a molecule that targets and cleaves DNA during gene editing processes.
3.  The Cas9 enzyme is involved in DNA repair machinery, correcting errors and mutations in the DNA sequence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Histone proteins are indeed crucial for chromosome structure, but they wrap around DNA, not RNA. DNA is the genetic material that provides the instructions for protein synthesis.

Statement 2 is partially correct. Guide RNA (gRNA) does indeed target specific DNA sequences during CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, but it doesn't directly cleave the DNA. The Cas9 enzyme is responsible for the cleavage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Cas9 enzyme is a nuclease that *cuts* DNA as part of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, not a component of the natural DNA repair machinery.  Cellular DNA repair mechanisms are distinct processes.


**3.  With reference to haemoglobin and oxygen transport, consider the following statements:**

1.  Haemoglobin, found in red blood cells (RBCs), transports only oxygen and not carbon dioxide.
2.  Chondrocytes, specialized cells in cartilage, are the primary producers of haemoglobin.
3.  Carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglobin, preventing oxygen transport.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Haemoglobin transports both oxygen and carbon dioxide, albeit in different ways and at different binding sites.  The oxygen binding is more significant for its function in oxygen transport.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Haemoglobin is produced in bone marrow, not in chondrocytes (cartilage cells). Chondrocytes are responsible for producing the extracellular matrix of cartilage.

Statement 3 is correct. Carbon monoxide (CO) has a much higher affinity for haemoglobin than oxygen.  The formation of carboxyhaemoglobin reduces the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity, leading to hypoxia (oxygen deficiency).


**4. With reference to urea and its properties, consider the following statements:**

1. Urea is primarily produced in the liver from the breakdown of starch.
2. Urea contributes significantly to the nitrogen cycle and is a high-nitrogen fertilizer.
3.  The government of India does not regulate the price of urea, leaving it to market forces.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the chemical composition and effects of acid rain, consider the following statements:**

1. Acid rain primarily results from the atmospheric deposition of nitric and sulfuric acids, formed through the oxidation of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.
2.  The presence of ammonium ions in acid rain significantly contributes to its corrosive nature and damage to building materials.
3. Acid rain exclusively affects aquatic ecosystems, with minimal impact on terrestrial environments or human health.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Acid rain is predominantly caused by the atmospheric deposition of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric acid (HNO₃). These acids are formed when sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react with water, oxygen, and oxidants in the atmosphere.  The combustion of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicle emissions are major sources of these precursor gases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ammonium ions (NH₄⁺) can be present in acid rain, they are a product of atmospheric ammonia (NH₃) reacting with acidic components. They do not directly contribute to the corrosive nature of acid rain; rather, they can act as a buffer, slightly mitigating the acidity in some cases.  The primary corrosive agents are the hydrogen ions (H⁺) from sulfuric and nitric acids.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Acid rain's effects are far-reaching.  It damages not only aquatic ecosystems (through acidification of lakes and streams, harming aquatic life) but also terrestrial ecosystems (by leaching essential nutrients from soils, affecting plant growth and overall biodiversity). Furthermore, acid rain poses significant threats to human health through respiratory problems and increased exposure to heavy metals mobilized from the soil.


**2. With reference to the sources and consequences of eutrophication, consider the following statements:**

1. Eutrophication is primarily caused by an excess of phosphorus and nitrogen in water bodies, leading to excessive algal growth.
2.  The Green Revolution, characterized by increased fertilizer use, significantly contributed to the widespread occurrence of eutrophication.
3. Eutrophication is an effective measure to control water pollution and enhance aquatic biodiversity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Eutrophication is a process where excessive nutrients (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus) enter water bodies, stimulating excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants. This leads to a depletion of oxygen, creating “dead zones” unsuitable for most aquatic life.  Agricultural runoff, sewage discharge, and industrial wastewater are major sources of these nutrients.

Statement 2 is correct. The Green Revolution, while boosting food production, involved heavy use of nitrogen-based fertilizers.  Runoff from agricultural fields carrying these fertilizers significantly increased nutrient loading in many water bodies, accelerating eutrophication in various regions globally.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Eutrophication is not a pollution control measure; it is itself a form of water pollution.  It drastically reduces water quality, harming aquatic life and disrupting ecosystem balance. It does not enhance biodiversity; instead, it leads to a decline in species diversity due to oxygen depletion and habitat degradation.


**3. With reference to the properties and applications of Hydrogen, consider the following statements:**

2.  The high energy density of hydrogen, relative to its weight, makes it an ideal fuel for transportation applications.
3. The National Hydrogen Mission in India primarily focuses on promoting the use of grey hydrogen produced from fossil fuels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The combustion of hydrogen (H₂) with oxygen (O₂) produces only water (H₂O) as a byproduct. This makes it a clean fuel compared to fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).  However, the "cleanliness" depends on the method of hydrogen production; if produced using fossil fuels, the overall carbon footprint may not be negligible.

Statement 2 is correct. Hydrogen possesses a very high energy density per unit mass, significantly higher than gasoline or diesel fuel. This makes it attractive for applications where weight is a critical factor, such as in transportation (e.g., fuel cell vehicles). However, its low energy density per unit volume poses storage and transportation challenges.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The National Hydrogen Mission in India aims to establish a robust hydrogen ecosystem, focusing on the production of green hydrogen (produced using renewable energy sources) and its integration into various sectors. While grey hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels) might play a transitional role, the mission's long-term goal emphasizes sustainable and environmentally friendly methods.


**4. With reference to Methane emissions and their environmental impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  Methane (CH₄) is a potent greenhouse gas, having a much greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide (CO₂) over a 20-year period.
2.  Landfills are significant sources of methane emissions, primarily due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic waste.
3.  Methane emissions from agricultural practices, such as rice cultivation and livestock farming, are relatively insignificant compared to other sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide on a shorter timescale. While CO₂ has a longer atmospheric lifetime, methane's higher radiative efficiency means it traps significantly more heat over a 20-year period.  This makes reducing methane emissions a crucial aspect of climate change mitigation efforts.

Statement 2 is correct.  Landfills are major sources of anthropogenic methane emissions.  In the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions), microorganisms decompose organic waste in landfills, producing methane as a byproduct.  Capturing and utilizing this landfill gas can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Agricultural activities are significant contributors to global methane emissions.  Rice paddies, due to their waterlogged conditions, create anaerobic environments conducive to methane production by methanogenic archaea.  Enteric fermentation in livestock (cows, sheep, etc.) also produces substantial amounts of methane.  These agricultural sources are a considerable portion of total global methane emissions.


**5. With reference to Limestone and its uses, consider the following statements:**

1. Limestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) and is a key component in the production of Portland cement.
2.  The high calcium content of limestone makes it suitable for use in the iron and steel industry as a flux in blast furnaces.
3. Limestone is resistant to acid rain, making it a suitable material for construction in areas with high acid deposition.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Limestone is a sedimentary rock predominantly composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), often in the form of the mineral calcite.  It is a crucial ingredient in the manufacturing of Portland cement, providing the calcium oxide needed for the cement's hydration and setting process.

Statement 2 is correct.  Limestone's high calcium content makes it an essential flux in iron and steel production.  The flux reacts with impurities in the iron ore, forming slag, which is then removed, leaving behind purer iron.  This process is critical in blast furnaces and other steelmaking processes.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Limestone is *not* resistant to acid rain.  In fact, it reacts readily with acidic substances, undergoing a chemical reaction that releases carbon dioxide (CO₂) and forms soluble calcium salts. This reaction contributes to the deterioration of limestone buildings and monuments in areas affected by acid rain.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  B cells and T cells are both types of leukocytes originating primarily in the bone marrow, playing crucial roles in adaptive immunity.
2.  Fluoride deficiency, commonly encountered through contaminated drinking water, primarily leads to dental fluorosis, characterized by mottled tooth enamel.
3.  Hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells, is solely responsible for oxygen transport in all vertebrates, with no alternative mechanisms existing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. B cells and T cells are indeed types of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell or leukocyte), both originating in the bone marrow.  B cells are responsible for humoral immunity (antibody production), while T cells mediate cellular immunity (directly attacking infected cells).  Their roles are central to adaptive immunity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While fluoride deficiency can lead to tooth decay (dental caries), the primary issue associated with *excess* fluoride in drinking water is dental fluorosis, resulting in mottled enamel.  Fluoride deficiency itself does not directly cause mottled enamel.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While hemoglobin is the primary oxygen carrier in most vertebrates,  cold-water icefish are a notable exception. They lack hemoglobin and rely on dissolved oxygen in their blood for oxygen transport via diffusion. This highlights the complexity of biological systems and the existence of alternative physiological mechanisms.


**2. With reference to the role of oxygen in various biological and environmental processes, consider the following statements:**

1. Phytoplankton in aquatic environments are the primary producers of oxygen, utilizing sunlight for photosynthesis and releasing oxygen as a byproduct.
2. Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carboxyhaemoglobin, formed by the binding of carbon monoxide to haemoglobin, inhibits oxygen transport and cellular respiration.
3. The early Earth's atmosphere, during the Archean eon, was characterized by a high concentration of oxygen, crucial for the development of early life forms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Phytoplankton, through photosynthesis, are major contributors to the Earth's oxygen supply.  They are microscopic organisms that conduct photosynthesis, consuming carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.

Statement 2 is correct. Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to haemoglobin with much greater affinity than oxygen, forming carboxyhaemoglobin. This prevents haemoglobin from binding to and transporting oxygen, leading to oxygen deprivation in tissues and potentially death.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The early Earth's atmosphere was largely devoid of free oxygen.  The Great Oxidation Event, a significant rise in atmospheric oxygen, occurred much later, primarily due to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.


**3. With reference to the components and processes involved in gene expression and modification, consider the following statements:**

1.  RNA, a single-stranded nucleic acid, is synthesized from a DNA template through a process called transcription, carrying genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes for protein synthesis.
2.  Genetically modified (GM) crops may involve the introduction of new DNA sequences or the removal of existing DNA sequences to alter their genetic makeup and introduce new traits.
3.  Histones, proteins found in eukaryotic cells, play a crucial role in DNA replication but not in the regulation of gene expression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Transcription is the process by which RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA using a DNA template. This RNA, often messenger RNA (mRNA), carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it directs protein synthesis.

Statement 2 is correct. Genetic modification of crops involves techniques to introduce new genes (e.g., for pest resistance) or remove existing genes (e.g., to eliminate undesirable traits).  These modifications alter the plant's genetic makeup and resulting characteristics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Histones are proteins that organize and compact DNA into chromatin.  They play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by influencing the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors.  While they are involved in DNA replication, their impact on gene expression is equally significant.


**4. With reference to the human immune system and related concepts, consider the following statements:**

1.  Passive immunity, a type of acquired immunity, involves the direct transfer of antibodies from an immune individual to a non-immune individual, providing immediate but temporary protection.
2.  Immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function, leads to increased susceptibility to infections and reduced responsiveness to vaccinations.
3.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), produced by a single clone of B cells, are heterogeneous mixtures of antibodies that bind to various epitopes on a single antigen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Passive immunity provides immediate protection by transferring pre-formed antibodies.  This is seen in maternal antibody transfer to a fetus or through antibody injections.  The protection is temporary because the recipient's immune system doesn't produce its own antibodies.

Statement 2 is correct.  Immunosenescence is a well-documented phenomenon where the immune system's effectiveness diminishes with age, leading to increased vulnerability to infections and less robust responses to vaccinations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are, by definition, *homogeneous*, meaning they are derived from a single clone of B cells and are identical. They bind to a single, specific epitope (antigenic determinant) on an antigen.  The description in the statement describes polyclonal antibodies, which are a mixture of different antibodies binding to different epitopes on the same antigen.


**5. Consider the following statements about different types of vaccines and their mechanisms:**

1.  mRNA vaccines, such as those used in some COVID-19 vaccines, introduce mRNA into cells, instructing them to produce viral proteins that trigger an immune response without integrating into the host's DNA.
2.  DNA vaccines introduce DNA directly into the cell's nucleus to achieve a longer-lasting immune response compared to mRNA vaccines.
3.  Inverse vaccines work by introducing self-antigens to the immune system, inducing tolerance and suppressing autoimmune responses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. mRNA vaccines deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding viral proteins.  The cells translate this mRNA into proteins, which are then presented to the immune system, inducing an antibody response. The mRNA itself does not integrate into the host's genome.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While DNA vaccines are being developed, the statement misrepresents their mechanism. DNA vaccines introduce DNA into cells, but this DNA is not integrated into the host's genome directly within the nucleus but instead, in the cytoplasm.  The resulting protein expression is also less efficient than mRNA vaccines.

Statement 3 is correct. Inverse vaccines are a novel approach targeting autoimmune diseases. They aim to induce immune tolerance to self-antigens by presenting them in a way that promotes their recognition as "self" and prevents an immune attack.

**1. With reference to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, consider the following statements:**

1.  Space and time are independent entities, as proposed by Newtonian physics.
2.  Gravitational attraction is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass.
3.  The warping of spacetime is inversely proportional to the mass of an object; a planet warps spacetime more than a star.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Einstein's General Theory of Relativity revolutionized our understanding of gravity.  Statement 1 is incorrect;  Newtonian physics treats space and time as separate and absolute entities, while Einstein's theory postulates that they are interwoven as a single entity called spacetime. This spacetime is dynamic and can be warped or curved. Statement 2 is correct:  The presence of mass warps or curves spacetime, and this curvature is what we experience as gravitational attraction.  Objects move along the curves created by massive bodies.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the greater the mass of an object, the more extreme the warping of spacetime. A black hole, for example, warps spacetime far more than a star or a planet. The warping is directly proportional, not inversely proportional, to mass. This warping of spacetime explains why objects are pulled towards more massive bodies.  Understanding the relationship between mass, spacetime curvature, and gravity is crucial for comprehending concepts like gravitational lensing and gravitational waves.


**2. With reference to Gravitational Lensing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gravitational lensing is an effect on light caused by the refraction of light as it passes through dense interstellar gas.
2.  Magnification of distant objects is a consequence of gravitational lensing, enabling observation of otherwise invisible objects.
3.  The Einstein Cross is an example of weak gravitational lensing, where the distortion of the background source is minimal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Statement 1 is incorrect; it describes a different astronomical phenomenon. Gravitational lensing is caused by the curvature of spacetime itself due to the presence of a massive object.  Light from a background source bends as it passes through this warped spacetime, resulting in the lensing effect. Statement 2 is correct; the bending of light can lead to magnification of the background source. This magnification allows astronomers to study objects that would otherwise be too faint or distant to be observed.  The lensing effect can also distort the image of the background source, causing it to appear as multiple images or arcs. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Einstein Cross is a specific, strong example of gravitational lensing where a quasar’s light is bent around a galaxy, creating four distinct images.  Weak lensing involves subtle distortions that are statistically analyzed to map the distribution of dark matter.


**3. With reference to Pulsars, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pulsars are slowly rotating neutron stars that emit radiation in a narrow beam.
2.  The period of a pulsar refers to the time it takes to complete one rotation.
3.  Scientists utilize pulsars as cosmic clocks due to their highly irregular pulse intervals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pulsars are fascinating celestial objects. Statement 1 is incorrect; pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars, not slowly rotating.  The rapid rotation, combined with their strong magnetic fields, results in the emission of beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles.  These beams sweep across space, and when they intersect with Earth, we observe them as pulses. Statement 2 is correct; the period of a pulsar is the time it takes for one complete rotation, which is remarkably consistent, making them useful as cosmic clocks. The regularity of pulses is a key characteristic. Statement 3 is incorrect; pulsars are highly valued for their incredibly precise and regular pulse intervals, not irregular. This regularity allows scientists to use them as highly accurate cosmic clocks to study various astrophysical phenomena.


**4. With reference to the LIGO-India Project, consider the following statements:**

1.  LIGO-India is a planned gravitational-wave observatory located in the state of Karnataka.
2.  The project is a collaboration between Indian research institutions and the LIGO Laboratory in the USA.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The LIGO-India project is a significant undertaking in the field of gravitational-wave astronomy. Statement 1 is incorrect; LIGO-India is planned to be located in Hingoli district, Maharashtra, not Karnataka.  The location was chosen based on various factors, including seismic stability and infrastructure.  Statement 2 is correct; LIGO-India is a collaborative project involving a consortium of Indian research institutions and the LIGO Laboratory in the United States. This collaboration leverages expertise and resources from both countries. Statement 3 is incorrect; while LIGO-India will be a highly advanced gravitational-wave detector, it will not be the first of its kind.  There are already advanced detectors operating in the USA and Japan (Kagra).  LIGO-India will enhance the global network of gravitational-wave detectors, increasing sensitivity and providing better localization of sources.


**5. With reference to the Einstein Telescope, consider the following statements:**

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Einstein Telescope represents a next-generation effort in gravitational-wave detection. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Einstein Telescope is a proposed *ground-based* observatory, not space-based.  The location underground is crucial for minimizing noise from seismic activity and other environmental factors. Statement 2 is correct; the planned underground location, at least 200 meters deep, is designed to significantly reduce interference from seismic noise and vibrations, which can obscure the faint signals of gravitational waves. Statement 3 is also correct; CERN, known for its expertise in large-scale scientific projects and vacuum technology, is indeed collaborating on the design of the detector’s crucial vacuum system.  The vacuum system is essential for creating the ultra-high vacuum environment required for precise laser interferometry measurements.


**6. With reference to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), consider the following statements:**

1. LISA is a ground-based observatory utilizing laser interferometry to detect gravitational waves.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

LISA represents a significant advancement in the search for gravitational waves. Statement 1 is incorrect; LISA is a *space-based* observatory, not ground-based. Its location in space is vital for detecting low-frequency gravitational waves that are difficult to observe from Earth due to interference. Statement 2 is correct; the LISA mission is indeed a major collaboration primarily between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), along with an international consortium of scientists.  The collaboration pools resources and expertise for this complex space mission. Statement 3 is also correct; LISA Pathfinder served as a crucial technology demonstrator mission. It successfully tested the key technologies required for LISA, such as precision drag-free control and laser interferometry in the harsh environment of space, paving the way for the full LISA mission.


**7. With reference to time dilation, consider the following statements:**

1. Time dilation is a phenomenon where time passes at the same rate for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or gravitational field.
2.  Time dilation is a consequence of Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, but not General Relativity.
3.  In stronger gravitational fields, time proceeds slower.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Time dilation is a fascinating consequence of Einstein's theories of relativity. Statement 1 is incorrect; time dilation is precisely the phenomenon where time passes at different rates for observers in relative motion or in different gravitational fields.  This contradicts the concept of absolute time in classical physics. Statement 2 is incorrect; time dilation is a consequence of *both* Special Relativity (due to relative velocity) and General Relativity (due to gravity). Special relativity deals with time dilation due to relative motion between observers, while general relativity deals with time dilation due to differences in gravitational potential. Statement 3 is correct;  stronger gravitational fields, caused by more massive objects, curve spacetime more significantly, and this curvature affects the passage of time. Time slows down in stronger gravitational fields, a prediction confirmed by experiments.


**8. With reference to black holes, consider the following statements:**

1.  All black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that undergo supernova explosions.
2.  The Schwarzschild radius defines the boundary of a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.
3.  Black holes are readily observable due to their strong electromagnetic radiation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Black holes are regions of spacetime with extreme gravity. Statement 1 is incorrect; while many black holes are formed from the collapse of massive stars, there are also other potential formation mechanisms, including the collapse of very dense stellar cores or through mergers of other compact objects.  The origin of supermassive black holes at galactic centers is still an area of active research. Statement 2 is correct; the Schwarzschild radius represents the event horizon, the boundary around a black hole from which nothing, including light, can escape. This is a defining characteristic of a black hole. Statement 3 is incorrect; black holes themselves are not directly observable because they do not emit or reflect light.  However, their presence can be inferred through their gravitational effects on nearby matter and the radiation emitted from the accretion disk of matter swirling around them.


**9. With reference to the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Dark Matter Map, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ACT primarily observes visible light to map the distribution of dark matter.
2. The ACT's observations support the standard model of cosmology regarding the universe's expansion rate.
3.  The ACT's dark matter map revealed that the universe is remarkably uniform in its distribution of dark matter, with minimal “lumpiness.”

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has played a crucial role in our understanding of the universe's large-scale structure. Statement 1 is incorrect; the ACT is a microwave telescope, not a visible-light telescope. It observes the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which is a relic from the early universe.  The CMB's subtle temperature variations are used to infer the distribution of dark matter. Statement 2 is correct; the ACT's high-resolution observations of the CMB have provided strong support for the standard model of cosmology, including its predictions about the universe's expansion rate and the relative abundances of dark matter and dark energy. Statement 3 is incorrect; the ACT's dark matter map actually revealed a significant degree of “lumpiness” in the distribution of dark matter.  This lumpiness reflects the clustering of dark matter on large scales, a feature consistent with the gravitational growth of structure in the universe.


**10. With reference to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic and powerful astrophysical phenomena. Statement 1 is incorrect; FRBs are characterized by their extremely short duration, typically lasting only milliseconds, not minutes.  This brief duration makes them challenging to detect. Statement 2 is correct; the dispersion of FRBs, which is the spreading of their radio waves due to their interaction with the ionized gas in interstellar and intergalactic space, is a valuable tool for studying the distribution of matter between galaxies.  The amount of dispersion is related to the amount of matter the FRB has traversed. Statement 3 is incorrect; while some FRBs may be associated with supernovae, the exact causes of FRBs are still a subject of ongoing research. Various potential sources have been proposed, including magnetars (highly magnetized neutron stars) and mergers of compact objects.


**12. With reference to Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), consider the following statements:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; GRBs are incredibly energetic explosions, far surpassing supernovae in terms of energy output.  They release an enormous amount of energy in the form of gamma rays in a very short time. Statement 2 is correct; a study has indeed suggested that the intense radiation from GRBs could temporarily deplete the Earth's ozone layer, although the probability of a GRB having a significant impact on Earth is relatively low due to their rarity and distance. Statement 3 is also correct; the high-energy radiation from GRBs can ionize molecules in the Earth's ionosphere, leading to temporary changes in its properties.  This ionization is a known effect of GRBs, although the extent of the impact depends on the GRB's intensity and distance from Earth.


**13. With reference to Quasi-moons, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Quasi-moons are a fascinating class of celestial bodies. Statement 1 is incorrect; quasi-moons do not orbit a planet in a stable, long-term orbit like a traditional moon.  Their orbits are typically more complex and less stable, often exhibiting temporary or transient interactions with a planet. Statement 2 is correct; 2023 FW13 is indeed an asteroid classified as a quasi-moon of Earth.  It shares a similar orbital period around the Sun as Earth but maintains a relatively distant and unstable relationship with our planet. Statement 3 is incorrect; quasi-moons are typically much smaller than planets, often being asteroids or smaller celestial bodies.  Their size and mass are significantly less than that of a traditional moon.

**Explanation:**

Zero Shadow Day is an interesting astronomical event. Statement 1 is incorrect; Zero Shadow Day occurs when the Sun is directly overhead, but not necessarily at the equator.  It occurs at locations between the tropics, depending on the Sun's declination throughout the year.  The exact location where it happens varies based on latitude. Statement 2 is correct; at any given location between the tropics, Zero Shadow Day can happen twice a year, once when the Sun moves north and once when it moves south. This is because of the Earth's tilt and the Sun's apparent movement across the sky. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Earth's rotation is important in determining the time of day when the Sun is overhead, the phenomenon of Zero Shadow Day is primarily due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the Sun.  The tilt causes the Sun's apparent position in the sky to vary throughout the year.


**15. With reference to Blazars, consider the following statements:**

1. Blazars are a type of galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole at its center.
2.  They are among the faintest objects in the universe, difficult to detect even with powerful telescopes.

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Blazars are extremely energetic and fascinating astronomical objects. Statement 1 is correct; blazars are indeed active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. These black holes accrete matter, releasing enormous amounts of energy in the process. Statement 2 is incorrect; blazars are among the *brightest* and most powerful objects in the universe, not the faintest.  Their brightness is due to the relativistic beaming of radiation from the jet of particles ejected near the black hole. Statement 3 is also correct; the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle has indeed observed the brightening of BL Lacertae, a well-known blazar.  Observations of blazar variability provide valuable information about the processes occurring near supermassive black holes.


**16. With reference to Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves, consider the following statements:**

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to pressure gradients in meteorology, consider the following statements:**

1.  Closely spaced isobars on a weather map indicate a steep pressure gradient, resulting in strong winds.
2.  The pressure gradient force is the primary driving force behind horizontal wind circulation near the Earth's surface.
3.  Frictional forces significantly enhance the pressure gradient force, leading to increased wind speeds, particularly over mountainous terrain.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Isobars represent lines of equal pressure. Closely spaced isobars indicate a rapid change in pressure over a short distance – a steep pressure gradient. This steep gradient creates a strong pressure gradient force, which directly translates to stronger winds.

Statement 2 is correct. The pressure gradient force is the fundamental force initiating horizontal wind movement. Air moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, attempting to equalize the pressure difference. While other forces like the Coriolis force and friction modify the wind's direction and speed, the pressure gradient force is the initial impetus.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Frictional forces act *against* the wind's movement, slowing it down.  They are particularly significant near the Earth's surface, reducing wind speeds.  While friction does influence wind circulation, it doesn't enhance the pressure gradient force; instead, it reduces its effect. The statement incorrectly implies that friction increases wind speed, especially over complex terrain.  In reality, friction is higher over mountainous terrain, leading to lower wind speeds compared to smoother surfaces.


**2. With reference to the factors influencing horizontal wind circulation near the Earth's surface, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Coriolis force deflects winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.
2.  Pressure gradients are primarily responsible for the direction of wind, while friction determines its speed.
3.  In the absence of friction, geostrophic winds would blow parallel to isobars.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Coriolis force is an inertial force that arises from the Earth's rotation. It causes moving objects (including air) to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection is crucial in shaping the large-scale patterns of wind circulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While pressure gradients are the primary force *initiating* wind movement (from high to low pressure), both pressure gradient and friction influence both the direction and speed. Friction slows down the wind, and its effect is more pronounced near the surface.  The statement oversimplifies the complex interplay of forces.

Statement 3 is correct. Geostrophic winds represent a balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force. In the absence of friction, this balance results in winds blowing parallel to isobars (lines of equal pressure).  This is a simplified model, but it's crucial for understanding wind patterns at higher altitudes where frictional forces are less dominant.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the influence of pressure gradients:**

1.  Peninsular India experiences distinct pressure gradient patterns due to its unique geographical location.
2.  The strength of the pressure gradient directly correlates with the spacing of isobars; wider spacing indicates a weaker gradient.
3.  Pressure gradients are solely responsible for the generation of all types of wind systems, including local breezes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The peninsular region's geographical features (coastal areas, mountains) and its location in the tropics influence the development of distinct pressure systems and associated wind patterns.  Monsoon winds, for instance, are a direct consequence of pressure differences between the land and sea.

Statement 2 is correct. The spacing of isobars is a direct visual representation of the pressure gradient on weather maps.  Widely spaced isobars indicate a gradual change in pressure over distance, resulting in a weak pressure gradient and gentle winds. Conversely, closely spaced isobars signify a steep pressure gradient and strong winds.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While pressure gradients are essential for wind generation, they don't solely determine all wind systems. Other factors like the Coriolis force, friction, temperature differences (leading to convection), and topography significantly influence wind patterns, especially local breezes which are driven by differential heating of land and water.  The statement overstates the role of pressure gradients.


**4. With respect to frictional forces and pressure, consider the following statements:**

1.  Frictional forces always oppose the motion of objects, including wind.
2.  In atmospheric systems, pressure forces always overcome frictional forces.
3.  Frictional forces are negligible at higher altitudes in the atmosphere.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Friction is a force that opposes motion. In the context of wind, friction acts between the air and the Earth's surface (and within the air itself), slowing down wind speeds.  This is why wind speeds are generally lower near the ground.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While pressure gradients are the driving force behind wind, frictional forces are always present and can significantly reduce wind speed, particularly near the surface.  The statement presents an oversimplification of the complex interaction between pressure and friction in atmospheric systems.  It's not universally true that pressure forces always dominate friction.

Statement 3 is correct. Frictional forces decrease with altitude. Near the Earth's surface, friction is substantial due to contact with the ground and vegetation. However, as altitude increases, the influence of friction diminishes considerably, allowing winds to flow more freely and at higher speeds.  At higher altitudes, the pressure gradient and Coriolis forces become dominant.

(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Pulling back the hands increases the time over which the force acts, reducing the average force experienced by the hands.  This is based on the impulse-momentum theorem. Statement 2 is correct.  Impulse is equal to the change in momentum, and the impulse experienced by the hands is equal and opposite to the change in momentum of the ball.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The work done by the hands on the ball is negative because the force exerted by the hands is opposite to the direction of motion of the ball. The hands are slowing the ball down. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.  This illustrates the application of Newtonian mechanics in everyday scenarios.


**11. With reference to DNA and RNA, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Protein synthesis in mammalian cells does not occur directly in the cell membrane.  The process takes place in ribosomes, which are often found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).  Amino acids are incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain during translation, but this process occurs within the cell's cytoplasm.

Statement 2 is correct.  The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information: DNA -> RNA -> Protein.  The translation of mRNA into proteins is a fundamental process in all living cells, including mammalian cells.  Ribosomes, often bound to the RER, are the sites of protein synthesis.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine, are essential components of many proteins in mammalian cells.  These amino acids play crucial roles in protein structure and function.  They are essential for the formation of disulfide bonds that contribute to protein stability.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the composition and function of proteins, consider the following statements:**

1.  Proteins found in autotroph tissues exclusively consist of sulphur-bearing amino acids.
2.  The synthesis of proteins in mammalian cells is solely dependent on the direct absorption of proteins from food.
3.  Chromosomes, crucial for genetic inheritance, are primarily composed of proteins and nucleic acids.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While sulphur-containing amino acids are a component of many proteins,  not all proteins in autotroph tissues contain them.  Autotrophs synthesize their own proteins from various amino acids, not exclusively sulphur-bearing ones.  The diversity of amino acids used varies depending on the specific protein and the organism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mammalian cells synthesize their own proteins through the process of translation, using mRNA as a template.  While dietary protein provides amino acids as building blocks, it's not directly absorbed as whole proteins into cells for protein synthesis. The body breaks down dietary proteins into amino acids which are then used to construct new proteins.

Statement 3 is correct. Chromosomes are complex structures composed of DNA (a nucleic acid) and various proteins, including histones. These proteins are vital for DNA packaging, organization, and regulation of gene expression.  The intricate interaction between DNA and proteins is fundamental to chromosome structure and function.


**2. With reference to the role of proteins in biological processes, consider the following statements:**

1.  The digestion of fats in the human body is primarily catalyzed by trypsin and chymotrypsin, both protein-based enzymes.
2.  Insulin, a crucial hormone regulating blood glucose levels, is a steroid hormone synthesized in the pancreas.
3. mRNA, a crucial molecule in protein synthesis, acts as a template that directly translates into proteins during translation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

3.  The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) sets the permissible limits for Uranium concentration in drinking water, exceeding which can cause kidney toxicity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  U-235 is indeed the primary fissile isotope used in nuclear reactors because it readily undergoes nuclear fission, releasing a large amount of energy. U-238, while not directly fissile, is a fertile isotope.  Through neutron capture and subsequent beta decay, it can be converted into Plutonium-239, which is fissile and can be used as nuclear fuel. This process is crucial in breeder reactors.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Uranium's occurrence is diverse. While it's significantly associated with crystalline rocks like granite and pegmatites due to its geochemical behavior during magmatic processes, it's also found in sedimentary deposits, including alluvial aquifers.  The leaching of Uranium from primary sources into groundwater is a significant environmental concern.

Statement 3 is accurate.  The BIS, responsible for setting standards in India, establishes permissible limits for various contaminants in drinking water, including Uranium.  Exposure to high levels of Uranium in drinking water can lead to kidney toxicity and other health problems.  The WHO also provides international guidelines for Uranium levels in water. Therefore, all three statements are factually correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While the ultimate decay product of the Uranium decay series is indeed a stable isotope of Lead, the statement oversimplifies a complex process.  The decay chain involves numerous radioactive intermediate products (like Radium), each with its own environmental and health implications.  The focus on Lead alone distracts from the broader radioactive hazard.  Further, while lead is a water contaminant, the statement wrongly implies that *only* lead poses health risks from Uranium decay.

Statement 2 is correct. Uranium contamination of groundwater is a serious environmental problem.  Its solubility in water allows it to leach from geological formations into aquifers, contaminating drinking water sources.  This can lead to widespread health problems and necessitates careful management of Uranium mining and processing activities.

Statement 3 is correct.  Both Rajasthan and Telangana are known for their Uranium deposits.  Mining and processing activities in these regions can lead to environmental contamination through the release of radioactive materials and heavy metals into the surrounding environment, including water bodies and soil.  The Northwestern states of India also have considerable Uranium deposits.

The use of leaded gasoline was phased out decades ago due to its severe environmental and health consequences.  Diesel fuel formulations focus on reducing harmful emissions, including sulfur and particulate matter, through the use of additives and refining processes.  The presence of lead in diesel would be a significant regulatory violation.


**2. With reference to the chemical compound Carbonic acid, consider the following statements:**

1.  Carbonic acid, formed by the reaction of carbon dioxide with water, is primarily responsible for the formation of caves through the dissolution of limestone.
2.  The reaction between carbonic acid and limestone (calcium carbonate) produces calcium bicarbonate, a soluble compound.
3.  Carbon dioxide directly reacts with limestone to produce carbonic acid, a key process in carbon sequestration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), formed when carbon dioxide (CO₂) dissolves in water, is a crucial agent in the chemical weathering of carbonate rocks like limestone (CaCO₃).  This process, known as carbonation, leads to the formation of caves and other karst features.  The slightly acidic nature of carbonic acid allows it to slowly dissolve the limestone, creating cavities over geological timescales.

Statement 2 is correct. The reaction between carbonic acid and limestone is a key step in cave formation. The carbonic acid reacts with calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) in limestone to form calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO₃)₂), which is soluble in water.  This soluble compound is then carried away by groundwater, leaving behind the characteristic void spaces of caves.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Carbon dioxide does not directly react with limestone to produce carbonic acid. The formation of carbonic acid requires the presence of water as a reactant.  Carbon dioxide first dissolves in water to form carbonic acid, which then reacts with the limestone.  While carbon sequestration involves the capture and storage of CO₂, the direct reaction described in statement 3 is not a primary mechanism in this process.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding sugarcane cultivation and its associated aspects:**

1. Rhizobium bacteria are the most suitable biofertilizers for enhancing sugarcane growth, significantly improving yield and nutrient uptake.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While biofertilizers are used in sugarcane cultivation, rhizobium is not the most suitable type.  Rhizobium is primarily associated with leguminous plants (those that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules). Sugarcane doesn't have this symbiotic relationship.  Other types of biofertilizers, such as those containing Azotobacter or Azospirillum, are more commonly employed for sugarcane.

Statement 2 is correct. Sugarcane is known for its high water requirement due to its large size and extensive root system.  Efficient irrigation management is crucial for optimal growth and yield, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Plants thriving in saline environments are termed halophytes, not thallophytes.  Thallophytes are a broad group of simple plants lacking distinct roots, stems, and leaves (e.g., algae, fungi, lichens). Halophytes possess adaptations to tolerate high salt concentrations in their surroundings.


**4. With reference to proteins and their characteristics, consider the following statements:**

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Proteins are indeed polymers of amino acids, and amino acids invariably contain nitrogen in their structure. The peptide bonds that link amino acids together to form polypeptide chains are crucial for protein structure and function. Nitrogen is an essential element for protein synthesis and is obtained from various sources in the environment.

Statement 2 is correct. Iron is a vital micronutrient for plant growth and development, and it plays a role in various enzymatic processes, including those involved in protein synthesis.  Iron deficiency can lead to chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) and impaired protein production in plants.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Enzymes are proteins, not fats and sugars. While some enzymes may have carbohydrate or lipid modifications, their primary structure and catalytic activity are determined by their protein components.  The statement incorrectly attributes the composition of enzymes to fats and sugars, which are distinct classes of biomolecules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While zinc is a component of many proteins, its primary biological role is as a cofactor in numerous enzymes and other proteins, playing a crucial role in various metabolic processes, not just structural support.

Statement 2 is correct. Sphalerite (ZnS) is a major zinc ore, and it often requires substantial processing to extract the pure zinc metal due to the presence of impurities and the need to separate zinc from other associated metals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Adding zinc to steel significantly *improves* its corrosion resistance without substantially reducing its tensile strength.  In fact, controlled additions of zinc can sometimes enhance certain mechanical properties of steel alloys.


**6. Consider the following statements about Nitrogen's role in biological systems and the environment:**

1. Plants primarily absorb nitrogen in the form of nitrates (NO3-), readily available in the soil.
2. The nitrogen cycle is a self-regulating process, unaffected by human activities such as fertilizer use and deforestation.

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Plants primarily absorb nitrogen in the form of nitrate ions (NO3-), which are soluble in water and easily absorbed by plant roots.  Other forms of nitrogen, like ammonium (NH4+), can also be used, but nitrates are the most common form taken up by plants.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Human activities significantly impact the nitrogen cycle.  The use of nitrogen fertilizers adds large quantities of reactive nitrogen to the environment, leading to eutrophication in water bodies, acid rain, and greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation also alters the nitrogen cycle by reducing the amount of nitrogen stored in trees and soil.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While ammonia is a product of nitrogen fixation, it is not readily absorbed by plants in its gaseous form.  Ammonium ions (NH4+), formed when ammonia dissolves in water, are the form absorbed by plants.  Gaseous ammonia is toxic to plants at high concentrations.


**7. With reference to crop rotation, consider the following statements:**

1. Crop rotation involving legumes helps in improving soil nitrogen content due to nitrogen fixation by symbiotic bacteria in the legume roots.
2. Deep-rooted crops should always be followed by shallow-rooted crops to optimize nutrient utilization and prevent soil compaction.
3. Crop rotation primarily aims at maximizing yield without considering the impact on soil health and pest management.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Legumes have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (like Rhizobium) in their root nodules. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by plants, enriching the soil with nitrogen. This makes the following crop more productive.

Statement 2 is correct. Alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted crops helps to optimize nutrient uptake from different soil layers and prevents soil compaction from repeated planting of the same type of crop.  Deep roots penetrate deeper into the soil, bringing up nutrients from lower layers, and shallow roots then utilize nutrients from the upper layers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Crop rotation is a sustainable agricultural practice that aims not only at maximizing yield but also at improving soil health, controlling pests and diseases, and reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides.  It is crucial for long-term soil fertility and environmental sustainability.

**1. Consider the following statements about Tokamak technology:**

1.  The ITER project is an example of a stellarator-type fusion reactor.
2.  Tokamaks operate at extremely low temperatures to achieve nuclear fusion.
3.  The JT-60, JET, and EAST are all examples of tokamak-based research facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ITER project is a prime example of a tokamak, not a stellarator. Stellarators and tokamaks are both magnetic confinement fusion devices, but they differ significantly in their magnetic field configurations.  Stellarators use complex, three-dimensional magnetic fields to confine the plasma, while tokamaks use a simpler, toroidal (doughnut-shaped) magnetic field.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Tokamaks operate at extremely *high* temperatures (millions of degrees Celsius) to initiate and sustain nuclear fusion reactions.  The high temperatures are necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between atomic nuclei, allowing them to fuse and release energy.

Statement 3 is correct.  JT-60 (Japan), JET (Joint European Torus), and EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak, China) are all major tokamak-based experimental fusion reactors worldwide, actively contributing to the advancement of fusion energy research.  These facilities employ different designs and technological approaches within the tokamak framework.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ethylene is indeed a naturally occurring plant hormone that plays a crucial role in fruit ripening.  FSSAI does regulate the use of ethylene in artificial ripening, setting permissible limits to ensure safety and prevent excessive use.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Polyethylene is derived from *ethylene*, not propylene.  While propylene is another important alkene used in the production of various polymers (like polypropylene), it's not the precursor for polyethylene. The chemical process of polymerization transforms ethylene molecules into long chains, forming polyethylene.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The use of ethylene in artificial fruit ripening is *not* completely banned in India.  While regulations exist to control its concentration and application methods to minimize potential health risks associated with excessive exposure, the complete ban is not in place.  FSSAI allows the use provided concentration doesn't exceed a specified limit.


**3. With reference to the relationship between onions, tomatoes, and potatoes, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tomatoes are botanically classified as fruits, while onions and potatoes are classified as vegetables.
2.  Onions and tomatoes are included in the same broad botanical group as potatoes.
3.  Potatoes and onions share a closer botanical relationship than onions and tomatoes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While tomatoes are botanically fruits (they develop from the flower's ovary and contain seeds),  onions and potatoes are also botanically classified differently. Onions are bulbs, and potatoes are tubers, both being vegetative structures.  The culinary classification as vegetables doesn't align with strict botanical definitions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Onions, tomatoes, and potatoes all belong to the plant kingdom and share a common ancestor within the broader classification of flowering plants (angiosperms).  However, their specific families and genera differ substantially.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Although all three are plants, potatoes (Solanaceae family) share a closer botanical relationship with tomatoes (Solanaceae family) than they do with onions (Alliaceae family). Onions are in a different family altogether.  The Solanaceae family is known for its many edible species, including tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers.


**4. Consider the following statements about the use of gases in food preservation:**

1.  Potato chips are often packaged in an atmosphere of nitrogen to prevent oxidation and rancidity.
2.  Hydrogen gas is commonly used in food packaging to extend the shelf life of potato chips.
3.  Oxygen is a desirable gas in packaging of potato chips to maintain freshness and crispness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nitrogen gas is a common inert gas used in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for potato chips and other snack foods.  It displaces oxygen, preventing oxidation that leads to rancidity and spoilage.  Nitrogen's inert nature helps maintain the quality and freshness of the product.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Hydrogen is not typically used in food packaging due to its flammability and potential reactivity.  Nitrogen is preferred for its inertness and safety.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Oxygen is detrimental to the quality of potato chips. Oxygen promotes oxidation of fats, leading to rancidity and a stale taste, and it also causes the chips to lose their crispness.  Therefore, oxygen is actively removed or minimized in the packaging process.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding  plant parasitic relationships:**

1. Cuscuta (dodder) is a stem parasite that derives its nutrition primarily from the stems of host plants.
2.  Chandan (sandalwood) is a root parasite that obtains nutrients from the roots of other plants.
3.  Orchids are considered holoparasites, completely dependent on their host plants for survival.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cuscuta is a stem parasite, attaching itself to the stems of host plants using specialized structures called haustoria to extract nutrients and water.  It doesn't primarily target leaves.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While sandalwood does have a partially parasitic relationship with host plants, it's not fully parasitic.  It's a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize itself but also obtains water and nutrients from the roots of other plants.  The description of Chandan as a root parasite is therefore an oversimplification.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Orchids are generally epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants for support but are not parasitic. They obtain nutrients and water from the air, rain, and decaying organic matter accumulating on their host plants.  Holoparasites lack chlorophyll and are completely dependent on their host for sustenance. Orchids possess chlorophyll and can perform photosynthesis, thus they are not holoparasites.

**1. With reference to Ethylene, consider the following statements:**

1. Ethylene oxide, a crucial chemical intermediate, is primarily derived from the direct oxidation of ethylene.
2. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) strictly regulates the use of ethylene in fruit ripening processes to ensure consumer safety and prevent potential health hazards.
3.  Ethane cracking, a significant industrial process, is primarily used for the production of ethylene, a key component in the manufacturing of various plastics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the production of biogas. Anaerobic digestion, a process involving the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen, is the fundamental mechanism behind biogas generation.  However, statement 1 is incorrect.  While methane is a major component of biogas, hydrogen is not a primary constituent. The primary components are methane and carbon dioxide.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the production of biogas does not involve polymerization. Polymerization is a chemical process that combines small molecules to form large chain-like molecules (polymers).  Biogas production is a biological process, primarily involving anaerobic decomposition.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the facts related to biogas production.


**4. With reference to the chemical element Iron, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Photosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create glucose (a sugar) and release oxygen.  Statement 3 is also correct. The oceans absorb a substantial amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, acting as a significant carbon sink. However, statement 1 is incorrect. While carbon dioxide is a significant component of biogas, it is not the primary source of energy. Methane is the primary component of biogas that provides the energy content. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correct regarding carbon dioxide's role in biological and environmental processes.


**7. With reference to Insulin, consider the following statements:**

1. Insulin, a crucial hormone, is primarily produced by the liver and regulates blood glucose levels.
2.  Genetic engineering techniques have enabled the large-scale production of human insulin for therapeutic purposes.
3. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), another pancreatic hormone, directly stimulates the release of insulin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  While genetic factors play a role (Statement 1), environmental factors, such as antibiotic overuse in agriculture and healthcare, are major contributors to the rise of multi-drug resistance. The widespread use of antibiotics in livestock farming creates selective pressure, leading to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria that can then transfer to humans through various routes (food chain, direct contact). Statement 3 is incorrect; individuals with multiple chronic diseases often face weakened immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections, including those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Their overall health status influences the likelihood and severity of such infections.

Statement 3 is accurate; the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission aims to eliminate sickle cell disease in India by 2047 through a multi-pronged approach.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding gene silencing:**

1.  Gene silencing is a process where gene expression is completely halted, preventing any protein synthesis from the targeted gene.
2.  RNA interference (RNAi) is a primary mechanism of gene silencing, involving the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA).
3.  Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are double-stranded RNA molecules that trigger gene silencing through the RNAi pathway.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While gene silencing significantly reduces or completely prevents gene expression, it doesn't necessarily mean a complete halt to *all* protein synthesis from the targeted gene.  The level of silencing can vary.  Partial silencing can still lead to reduced protein production, but not a complete absence.

Statement 2 is correct. RNA interference is a crucial mechanism of gene silencing, primarily involving the degradation of mRNA molecules that carry the genetic information for protein synthesis.  This prevents the translation of the mRNA into proteins.

Statement 3 is correct. siRNAs are indeed double-stranded RNA molecules that initiate gene silencing by binding to complementary mRNA sequences. This binding triggers the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), leading to mRNA degradation and thus silencing the gene's expression.


**2. With reference to cyberattacks and their impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cryptocurrencies, due to their decentralized nature, are completely immune to cyberattacks targeting financial transactions.
2.  Cyberattacks primarily target large financial institutions like banks, given their extensive digital infrastructure and valuable data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address, not a proof of citizenship.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Aadhaar uses multiple biometric authentication methods, including fingerprints and iris scans, not exclusively iris scanning. The choice of biometric method depends on the specific application and the availability of the required biometric data.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Aadhaar's open APIs facilitate integration, they are designed with specific security protocols and access controls to protect sensitive personal data.  Integration is not guaranteed for every device due to these security considerations.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While blockchain underpins cryptocurrencies, its applications extend far beyond that. It's used in supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, and many other sectors where secure and transparent record-keeping is crucial.

Statement 2 is correct.  The immutability of blockchain (the inability to alter past records once they're added to the chain) is a major advantage for security.  It enhances trust and traceability in various applications, making it difficult to tamper with records.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While decentralization enhances security, it doesn't eliminate the risk of breaches or attacks entirely.  Smart contracts, the underlying code of blockchain applications, can still contain vulnerabilities, and external systems interacting with blockchain can be targets for attacks.  Furthermore, human error in managing access keys remains a significant risk.


**6. With reference to 3D printing and its applications, consider the following statements:**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to CRISPR-Cas9 technology, consider the following statements:**

1. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing tool primarily used for gene insertion, not gene silencing.
2.  ZFN (Zinc Finger Nuclease) and TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease) are unrelated gene editing techniques compared to CRISPR-Cas9.
3.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a type of additive manufacturing technology, similar to 3D printing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is false because CRISPR-Cas9 is indeed used for gene silencing, along with gene editing and other modifications. It's a versatile tool with diverse applications. Statement 2 is incorrect as ZFN and TALEN are indeed related techniques; they are all types of gene editing nucleases, although CRISPR-Cas9 offers significant advantages in terms of simplicity and efficiency. Statement 3 is fundamentally wrong. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing biotechnology technique, not an additive manufacturing technology like 3D printing.  These are distinct fields of technology with different applications and principles.  The confusion might arise from the fact that both technologies involve precise manipulation, but their targets and methods are entirely different.  CRISPR-Cas9 manipulates DNA sequences at a molecular level, while 3D printing manipulates physical materials.


**2. With reference to the applications of 3D printing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing is not a type of 3D printing.
2.  3D printing has limited applications in the automotive industry, primarily for prototyping.
3.  4D printing, a technology that evolves from 3D printing, incorporates time as a fourth dimension, allowing for shape-changing objects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing is a specific *type* of 3D printing, utilizing extrusion to deposit molten metal layer by layer. Statement 2 is incorrect; 3D printing is extensively used in the automotive industry, not only for prototyping but also for producing customized parts, tooling, and even entire vehicle components.  The application is far beyond prototyping. Statement 3 is correct. 4D printing is an emerging field that builds upon 3D printing by incorporating materials that change shape or properties over time in response to external stimuli (temperature, light, etc.), effectively adding the dimension of time. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.



**3. With reference to emerging communication technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), consider the following statements:**

1. The scenario described in the prompt (smartphone alarm triggering geyser, smart mirror displaying weather and tank levels, smart refrigerator ordering groceries, etc.) is best described by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
2. The smart refrigerator's ability to recognize stock shortages and place orders exemplifies the application of artificial intelligence (AI) within the Internet of Things (IoT).
3. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the primary protocol enabling communication between devices in the IoT, but not the overarching concept describing the interconnectedness of devices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a routing protocol used in the internet's core infrastructure; it's not related to the interconnectedness of everyday devices in a home automation system as described in the prompt. Statement 2 is correct.  The smart refrigerator's functionality showcases AI's role in IoT; AI algorithms analyze data (inventory levels) to trigger actions (placing orders). This is a key feature of smart devices within the IoT ecosystem. Statement 3 is also largely correct. While IP is a fundamental protocol enabling communication between devices, the IoT concept encompasses far more than just the IP protocol. It involves the interconnection, data exchange, and automation of various devices, systems, and services.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are the most accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the predictions of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity:**

1. The theory predicts that light is affected by gravity, as demonstrated by gravitational lensing.
2. The theory directly predicts the constant expansion of the universe, although the rate of expansion was later discovered.
3. The theory postulates that matter warps its surrounding space-time, a concept crucial to understanding gravity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. General relativity predicts that massive objects warp spacetime, causing light to bend as it passes near them. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, has been observed and confirmed. Statement 2 is incorrect. While general relativity laid the groundwork for understanding the universe's expansion, it doesn't directly predict the constant expansion; the expansion itself was a later discovery supported by observational evidence. The theory provides the framework for understanding *how* gravity influences the universe's evolution, but not the expansion itself as a primary prediction. Statement 3 is correct.  The warping of spacetime by matter is a central tenet of general relativity, forming the basis of its explanation of gravity.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate predictions of Einstein's theory.


**5. With reference to India's Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), consider the following statements:**

1. IRNSS originally consisted of seven satellites, with three in geostationary orbit and four in geosynchronous orbits.
2. IRNSS provides navigation coverage to India and a region extending approximately 1,500 km beyond its borders.
3.  India's own satellite navigation system with full global coverage was achieved by 2019.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IRNSS constellation initially comprised seven satellites; three were in geostationary orbit for continuous coverage, and four were in geosynchronous orbits to augment coverage and improve accuracy. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While IRNSS provides coverage to India, the extent of coverage beyond its borders is significantly less than 5500 sq km as originally stated.  It extends to neighboring regions but not to such a large extent.  Statement 3 is incorrect; NavIC (IRNSS) does not provide full global coverage.  It's designed for regional navigation primarily within and around India.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**6. With reference to the uses of GPS technology, consider the following statements:**

1. GPS technology is used extensively in mobile phone operations for location-based services.
2. GPS technology plays a minimal role in banking operations, primarily used for ATM security.
3. GPS technology is increasingly used for controlling power grids and monitoring power distribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GPS is fundamental to mobile phone location services, enabling features like navigation, location tagging, and emergency services. Statement 2 is largely incorrect. While GPS might have some limited applications in ATM security, its role in core banking operations is negligible.  GPS is not a central technology used for everyday banking transactions. Statement 3 is correct. GPS technology is increasingly used for monitoring and controlling power grids, aiding in efficient power distribution, maintenance scheduling, and emergency response. Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**7. With reference to India's satellite launch vehicles, consider the following statements:**

1. PSLVs are primarily designed for launching communication satellites, while GSLVs launch satellites for Earth resource monitoring.
2.  Both PSLVs and GSLVs use the same type of propulsion systems.
3.  ISRO's launch vehicles are entirely reliant on imported technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PSLVs (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles) are primarily used to launch smaller satellites into lower Earth orbits, often for Earth observation (remote sensing) and scientific missions.  GSLVs (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicles) are designed to launch heavier communication satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbits.  The statement reverses the roles. Statement 2 is incorrect. PSLVs and GSLVs utilize different propulsion systems, tailored to their respective payload capacities and mission requirements. Statement 3 is incorrect. While ISRO initially relied on some imported technologies, its launch vehicle program has significantly advanced to be largely indigenous, with a high degree of self-reliance in design, manufacturing, and testing.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.

**78. With reference to the impact of solar activity on Earth, consider the following statements:**

1.  Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) primarily affect Earth's power grids by inducing powerful geomagnetic storms.
2.  Solar flares directly cause significant disruptions to power grids by emitting high-energy particles that overload transformers.
3.  The intensity of geomagnetic storms caused by solar wind is directly proportional to the number of sunspots observed on the Sun's surface.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are large expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's corona. When these CMEs reach Earth, they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, inducing geomagnetic storms. These storms can cause fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field, leading to induced currents in long conductors like power transmission lines. These induced currents can overload transformers and other power grid components, potentially causing widespread blackouts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While solar flares do emit high-energy radiation and particles, the primary mechanism by which they affect power grids is indirect. The high-energy radiation can ionize the Earth's upper atmosphere, affecting radio communications, but the direct impact on power grids is minimal compared to the geomagnetically induced currents from CMEs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While sunspot numbers are a good indicator of overall solar activity, the intensity of geomagnetic storms is not solely determined by the number of sunspots. The orientation and strength of the magnetic field associated with CMEs play a crucial role in determining the severity of the geomagnetic storm. A CME from a region with a strong magnetic field can cause a significant geomagnetic storm even if the number of sunspots is relatively low.  The relationship is complex and not a simple direct proportionality.


**79. With reference to the THAAD anti-missile system, consider the following statements:**

1.  THAAD is primarily designed to intercept ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, at altitudes of 40-150 km.
2.  The THAAD system's interceptor missile uses a kinetic kill vehicle, relying on impact force to destroy incoming threats.
3.  South Korea is the only country besides the US that has deployed the THAAD system on its territory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) is designed to intercept ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, but the altitude range is generally considered to be higher than 40-150 km.  The system is capable of engaging threats at significantly higher altitudes.

Statement 2 is correct. The THAAD interceptor missile uses a hit-to-kill approach, meaning it relies on the kinetic energy of the impact to destroy the incoming missile. It does not use an explosive warhead.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While South Korea has deployed THAAD, other countries have expressed interest in or have acquired the system.  It's not exclusively deployed in South Korea besides the US.


**80. With reference to the Earth's magnetic field, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Earth's magnetic field is generated by convection currents in the Earth's outer core, primarily composed of liquid iron.
2.  The Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis are visual manifestations of the interaction between charged particles from the Sun and the Earth's magnetic field lines.
3.  The Earth's magnetic field has remained consistently stable throughout its geological history, with no evidence of reversals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Earth's magnetic field is a geodynamo, generated by the movement of molten iron in the Earth's outer core.  These convection currents, driven by heat escaping from the core, create electric currents that generate the magnetic field.

Statement 2 is correct. The auroras are caused by charged particles from the solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetosphere. These particles are channeled along the magnetic field lines towards the poles, where they excite atmospheric gases, causing them to emit light.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Earth's magnetic field is not static; it has undergone numerous reversals throughout geological history.  Evidence from paleomagnetism shows that the magnetic poles have switched places many times, with the time between reversals varying significantly.


**81. With reference to solar power initiatives in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) is implemented by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
2.  SECI is primarily responsible for determining solar power tariffs in India.
3. India's silicon wafer production capacity significantly contributes to the global photovoltaic (PV) industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) is a major initiative under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), and SECI plays a crucial role in its implementation, particularly in aspects related to renewable energy integration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While SECI is a significant player in India's solar sector, it doesn't solely determine solar power tariffs.  Tariff determination involves a more complex process involving bidding, market dynamics, and regulatory oversight.

Statement 3 is partially correct, but the phrasing is misleading. While India is a significant producer of silicon wafers, its contribution to the global PV industry is not as dominant as the statement implies.  The global PV industry is highly competitive with numerous significant players across the world.  The statement overstates India's global share.

**1. Consider the following statements about the Event Horizon:**

1. The Event Horizon of a black hole is defined by its Schwarzschild radius, a distance beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.
2.  Radiation emitted from beyond the Event Horizon can still be observed by external observers.
3. The Event Horizon is a physical boundary that marks the point of no return for matter falling into a black hole.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Schwarzschild radius defines the Event Horizon of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole.  It's the critical distance from the singularity where the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.  Anything crossing this radius is trapped.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Radiation cannot escape from *within* the Event Horizon.  Any radiation emitted from inside the Event Horizon is trapped and cannot be observed by external observers. While Hawking radiation is theoretically emitted from the Event Horizon itself, it's a quantum effect and not directly related to matter or radiation crossing the Event Horizon.

Statement 3 is correct. The Event Horizon is indeed a point of no return. Once matter crosses it, it's inescapably drawn towards the singularity at the black hole's center.  It's a crucial concept in understanding the physics of black holes.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**2. With reference to the Standard Model of particle physics, consider the following statements:**

1. The Standard Model accurately predicts the existence and properties of all known fundamental particles, including dark matter.
2. The Standard Model successfully describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces but not gravity.
3.  Quarks and leptons are fundamental constituents described within the Standard Model, while bosons are force carriers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Standard Model is highly successful in explaining a vast range of experimental data, but it does *not* account for dark matter or dark energy. These are significant components of the universe's mass-energy content that remain unexplained by the Standard Model.

FSSAI does permit the use of ethylene for artificial ripening under specific concentration limits to ensure food safety. Statement 3 is incorrect. While liquid nitrogen is used in the food industry for freezing and preservation, it is not a suitable or approved method for artificial ripening of fruits.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making option (a) the correct choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude one of the correct statements about ethylene and FSSAI regulations or include an inaccurate statement regarding liquid nitrogen's use in fruit ripening.  The question tests understanding of food safety regulations and the role of ethylene in agriculture.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Dengue in India:**

1.  The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) primarily focuses on eradicating the Aedes mosquito, the dengue vector, through larvicidal measures.
2.  A recently approved dengue vaccine, DengiAll, offers complete protection against all dengue serotypes, significantly reducing hospitalization rates.
3.  Gene drive technology, while showing promise in controlling dengue mosquito populations, faces ethical concerns regarding unintended ecological consequences.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The NVBDCP does target the Aedes mosquito, but its strategies encompass more than just larvicides.  It involves integrated vector management including source reduction, public awareness campaigns, and community participation.  The focus is on controlling the mosquito population, not necessarily complete eradication, which is practically impossible.  

Statement 2 is incorrect. While several dengue vaccines are under development or have received approval in some regions,  no currently available vaccine offers complete protection against all four dengue serotypes.  Furthermore, the impact on hospitalization rates varies depending on factors like the vaccine's efficacy, serotype prevalence, and the recipient's prior exposure to dengue.  The claim of significant reduction in hospitalization rates is an overstatement.

Statement 3 is correct. Gene drive technology holds potential for controlling mosquito populations, potentially reducing dengue transmission. However, the technology is controversial due to potential unforeseen ecological consequences and ethical concerns regarding genetic manipulation of wild populations.  The long-term effects are not fully understood, and the potential for unintended consequences is a significant hurdle.


**2. With reference to Pneumoconiosis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pneumoconiosis, a chronic lung disease, primarily affects workers in the coal mining industry due to inhalation of coal dust.
2.  Exposure to high levels of PM2.5, a major air pollutant, is not a significant contributing factor to the development of pneumoconiosis.
3.  Mica industry workers, known for their exposure to respirable dust particles, are not significantly at risk of developing pneumoconiosis.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) is a well-known occupational lung disease caused by inhaling coal dust.  While other industries can also contribute to pneumoconiosis (e.g., silica dust in mining, asbestos in construction), the coal mining industry is a primary source of cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PM2.5, fine particulate matter, is a significant air pollutant associated with various respiratory illnesses, including exacerbating existing lung conditions and potentially contributing to the development of pneumoconiosis.  While not a direct cause in the same way as specific dusts, PM2.5's contribution to overall lung health cannot be ignored.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Mica mining and processing also expose workers to significant levels of respirable dust, putting them at risk for pneumoconiosis.  The fine particles of mica can lead to similar lung damage as seen in other forms of pneumoconiosis.




**3. With reference to India's missile defence systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Trishul missile, a supersonic surface-to-air missile, is part of India's Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and boasts a range exceeding 50 km.
2.  The Indian Air Force (IAF) operates the Samar-1 system, a sophisticated anti-missile system primarily designed for intercepting incoming ballistic missiles.
3.  The Akash missile, a medium-range surface-to-air missile, is not currently deployed as part of India's air defence network.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Trishul was indeed part of the IGMDP, it is a short-range, low-level surface-to-air missile, and its range is significantly less than 50 km.  The description overstates its capabilities.

Statement 2 is correct. The IAF does indeed operate the Samar-1 system, an indigenous short-range air defence system. However, its primary role is not intercepting ballistic missiles; it's designed to counter low-altitude threats like aircraft and drones. The statement misrepresents its main function.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Akash missile system is indeed a crucial component of India's air defence network, deployed and operational.  The statement incorrectly claims it is not deployed.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding AIDS:**

1.  Swollen lymph nodes, a common symptom of AIDS, are often one of the first noticeable signs of HIV infection.
2.  Night sweats, while a symptom associated with various conditions, are not specifically indicative of AIDS.
3.  Loss of memory and weight loss are not considered primary symptoms of AIDS but can manifest during later stages of the disease.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Swollen lymph nodes are a common symptom in early stages of HIV infection, often appearing before other more serious symptoms. However, they are not exclusive to AIDS and can occur in many other conditions.  The statement oversimplifies the symptom's significance.

Statement 2 is correct. Night sweats are a symptom that can be associated with several diseases, including AIDS. However, it's not a primary or defining symptom of AIDS. The statement correctly points out its non-specificity.

Statement 3 is correct. While memory loss (neurological symptoms) and weight loss (wasting syndrome) are not early symptoms, they do occur as the disease progresses. These are often indicative of advanced HIV infection leading to AIDS.  The statement accurately reflects their appearance in later stages.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Section 3(j) of the Indian Patents Act, 1970, deals with the patentability of certain inventions, including plants and animals. This section significantly influenced the legal battles surrounding Monsanto's Bt cotton patents in India, leading to debates on the scope of patentability for life forms and the implications for farmers' rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The PPVFR Authority, responsible for protecting plant varieties and farmers' rights, has been involved in several cases related to Monsanto's Bt cotton, reflecting the complexities of balancing intellectual property rights with the interests of Indian farmers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Delhi High Court's rulings on cases involving Monsanto's Bt cotton technology have been varied and not consistently in Monsanto's favor.  It is inaccurate to claim consistent rulings in their favor.


**3. With reference to the development and deployment of Bt cotton in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Monsanto developed the Bollgard-II variety of Bt cotton, which incorporates a toxin gene from *Bacillus thuringiensis*.
2.  The Bollgard variety of Bt cotton, introduced by Monsanto, uses a single gene from *Bacillus thuringiensis* for insect resistance.
3.  Bt cotton's insect resistance is solely attributed to the Bt toxin produced by the introduced bacterial gene, without any other contributing factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Monsanto developed several varieties of Bt cotton, including Bollgard-II, which incorporates genes from *Bacillus thuringiensis* to produce insecticidal proteins, enhancing the crop's resistance to certain pests.

Statement 2 is correct. The initial Bollgard variety primarily relied on a single gene from *Bacillus thuringiensis* for pest control.  Later versions incorporated additional genes to broaden the spectrum of insect resistance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Bt toxin is the primary mechanism of insect resistance in Bt cotton, other factors, such as plant physiology and environmental conditions, can also influence the effectiveness of this resistance.  It's not a solely gene-determined trait.


**4.  Consider the following statements regarding the impact of Monsanto's activities on the Indian agricultural landscape:**

1. The introduction of Bt cotton significantly reduced pesticide usage in Indian agriculture.
2. Monsanto's Bt cotton technology led to a substantial increase in cotton production in India.
3. The adoption of Bt cotton completely eliminated the problem of pest infestations in cotton cultivation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but overstates the impact. While Bt cotton reduced the need for some broad-spectrum insecticides, the overall pesticide usage hasn't uniformly decreased across all cotton farming practices.  The reduction is context-dependent and not universal.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The adoption of Bt cotton did lead to an increase in cotton production in India, although the extent of the increase is subject to various factors including weather patterns and farming practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Bt cotton provided resistance to specific pests, but it did not eliminate pest infestations entirely.  Other pests and evolving resistance mechanisms still pose challenges to cotton cultivation.  The claim is an oversimplification of a complex agricultural reality.

**1. With reference to genetic disorders, consider the following statements:**

1.  Haemophilia is a sex-linked genetic disorder inherited via the Y chromosome, predominantly affecting males.
2.  Diabetes mellitus, categorized as a rare disease, is primarily treated using Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT).
3.  The National Programme for Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) is a government initiative specifically targeting the prevention and management of diabetes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Haemophilia is indeed a sex-linked genetic disorder, but it's inherited via the X chromosome, not the Y chromosome.  Males are more frequently affected because they only have one X chromosome, so a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disease. Females, having two X chromosomes, typically need two copies of the mutated gene to exhibit the condition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While diabetes is included under the umbrella of rare diseases in some classifications, ORT (Oral Rehydration Therapy) is primarily used for treating dehydration associated with diarrheal diseases, not diabetes itself. Diabetes management involves various approaches including lifestyle modifications, medication, and insulin therapy.

Statement 3 is correct. The NPCDCS is a major Indian government program dedicated to the prevention, early detection, and management of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke.  It aims to reduce the burden of these non-communicable diseases through public health interventions and awareness campaigns.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.



**2. With reference to the production of monoclonal antibodies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Australia is the leading global producer of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), primarily utilizing hybridoma technology.
2.  India procures a significant portion of its monoclonal antibody requirements from domestic manufacturers.
3.  Hybridoma technology is a biotechnological approach exclusively used for the commercial production of monoclonal antibodies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Many countries, including the US, China, and several European nations, have substantial monoclonal antibody production capabilities.  The global market is diverse and competitive.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India does produce and use monoclonal antibodies, but a significant portion of its requirements are *not* sourced from solely domestic manufacturers.  Importation plays a role, depending on the specific antibody and its application.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Hybridoma technology is a crucial method for producing monoclonal antibodies, but it is not the *exclusive* method. Other techniques, such as recombinant DNA technology and phage display, are also used for commercial production of mAbs. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the applications of biotechnology, consider the following statements:**

1.  Monoclonal antibodies are exclusively produced through hybridoma technology and are primarily used in the treatment of infectious diseases.
2.  Hybridoma technology, a revolutionary technique in biotechnology, was initially developed for the large-scale production of antibiotics.
3.  The commercial production of interferon, a crucial antiviral protein, relies heavily on the application of hybridoma technology.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

Statement 1 is incorrect. While hybridoma technology is a major method for producing monoclonal antibodies, it's not the exclusive one.  Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies have broader applications beyond just infectious diseases; they are used in diagnostics, research, and various therapeutic areas, including cancer treatment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Hybridoma technology was not initially developed for antibiotic production.  It was developed to produce large quantities of specific antibodies (monoclonal antibodies) which are quite distinct from antibiotics.  Antibiotic production typically relies on microbial fermentation techniques.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Interferon production doesn't primarily rely on hybridoma technology.  While hybridoma technology produces antibodies, interferon is a cytokine (protein) and its large-scale production utilizes recombinant DNA technology in host cells like bacteria or mammalian cells.  Therefore, none of the statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the inheritance and characteristics of Haemophilia:**

1.  Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning it is inherited through the Y chromosome and primarily affects females.
2.  Individuals with haemophilia exhibit prolonged bleeding due to deficiencies in specific clotting factors, primarily factor VIII or factor IX.
3.  The severity of haemophilia symptoms varies widely among individuals, influenced by the level of clotting factor deficiency.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2
(d) 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Haemophilia is indeed X-linked, meaning the gene responsible is located on the X chromosome.  However, it's a *recessive* disorder, which means that females, having two X chromosomes, typically need two copies of the mutated gene to be affected (one on each X chromosome).  Males, having only one X chromosome, are more susceptible because one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disease.  It is the males who are primarily affected, not females.

Statement 2 is correct. Haemophilia is characterized by prolonged bleeding because of deficiencies in clotting factors VIII (Haemophilia A) or IX (Haemophilia B).  These factors are essential for the proper functioning of the blood clotting cascade.

Statement 3 is correct. The severity of haemophilia symptoms is directly related to the level of clotting factor deficiency.  Individuals with mild haemophilia may experience only occasional bleeding episodes, while those with severe haemophilia have frequent and potentially life-threatening bleeds.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

**1. With reference to Malaria, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) malaria vaccine is included in the WHO's prequalification list.
2.  Plasmodium vivax is the only Plasmodium species responsible for severe malaria cases.
3.  The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) primarily focuses on the eradication of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine has received WHO prequalification, indicating its safety and efficacy.  While its effectiveness is not 100%, it represents a significant step in malaria control.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While *Plasmodium vivax* is a common cause of malaria, *Plasmodium falciparum* is the species most often responsible for severe and life-threatening malaria cases.  Different Plasmodium species exhibit varying degrees of pathogenicity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NVBDCP targets multiple mosquito vectors of malaria, including Anopheles stephensi and other species prevalent in India, not solely Anopheles gambiae, which is more common in Africa.  The program employs a multi-pronged approach encompassing vector control, surveillance, and case management.  Focusing solely on one mosquito species would be insufficient for effective malaria control in diverse geographical areas.


**2. With reference to Tuberculosis (TB) and related initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) in India uses Gene Drive technology as a primary method of TB control.
2.  Exposure to ionizing radiation significantly increases the risk of developing Tuberculosis.
3.  The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) classifies Tuberculosis under the domain of infectious diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While gene drive technology shows promise in combating vector-borne diseases like malaria, it's not currently a primary method employed in the NTEP for TB control. The NTEP focuses on strategies like early diagnosis, treatment, and preventive measures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Ionizing radiation is linked to an increased risk of certain cancers and immune deficiencies, but it's not directly correlated with a significantly heightened risk of developing tuberculosis.  TB primarily results from infection with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

Statement 3 is correct. The ICD-11, the latest version of the international standard diagnostic classification, accurately categorizes Tuberculosis as an infectious disease.  This classification facilitates global data collection and standardization in disease reporting and research.


**3. With reference to the global fight against Malaria, consider the following statements:**

1. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) explicitly included the complete eradication of Malaria as a primary objective.
2. R21/Matrix-M is a newly developed malaria vaccine that has already been widely deployed globally.
3. Anopheles stephensi is a major mosquito vector for the transmission of Malaria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MDGs addressed various health issues, the goal was not the complete eradication of malaria, but a significant reduction in its prevalence and mortality.  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have continued this focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While R21/Matrix-M is a promising malaria vaccine candidate, it's not yet widely deployed globally.  Extensive clinical trials and regulatory approvals are still ongoing before widespread implementation.

Statement 3 is correct. Anopheles stephensi is indeed a significant mosquito vector responsible for transmitting malaria, particularly in urban areas.  Its adaptability to various environments makes it a challenging vector to control.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both *Charakasamhita* and *Sushruta Samhita* discuss leprosy,  the *Charakasamhita* also contains descriptions of Tuberculosis. The Sushruta Samhita is notable for its early mention of leprosy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Isoniazid is primarily used in the treatment of Tuberculosis. While it might have some limited activity against Leprosy, it is not a standard or highly effective treatment for Leprosy.  Multidrug therapy (MDT) is the standard treatment for Leprosy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian government's National Strategic Plan (NSP) & Roadmap for Leprosy (2023-27) explicitly aims to achieve zero transmission of leprosy in India by 2027.  This reflects a significant national commitment to leprosy eradication.


**3. With reference to genetic diseases, consider the following statements:**

1.  Haemophilia is an example of a disease caused by the expression of a dominant gene present on the Y chromosome.
2.  Sickle cell anaemia is a hereditary condition primarily caused by the expression of a recessive gene.
3.  Iron-fortified rice is generally recommended as a dietary supplement for individuals with Sickle Cell Anaemia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Haemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder, meaning it is caused by a recessive gene located on the X chromosome, not a dominant gene on the Y chromosome.  Males are more commonly affected because they only have one X chromosome.

Statement 2 is correct. Sickle cell anaemia is a hereditary condition caused by a recessive gene that results in the production of abnormal haemoglobin, leading to misshapen red blood cells.  Individuals must inherit two copies of the recessive gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Iron-fortified rice is generally *not* recommended for individuals with Sickle Cell Anaemia because it can exacerbate iron overload, a common complication of the disease.  Individuals with Sickle Cell Anaemia often require careful management of their iron levels to prevent further health problems.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding DDT:**

1. DDT's bioaccumulation in food chains is an example of biological magnification, primarily affecting bird populations through eggshell thinning.
2.  The Indian government has recently reinstated the use of DDT as an effective insecticide against mosquitoes, due to the emergence of DDT-resistant mosquito strains.
3. Dicofol, a pesticide, is chemically unrelated to DDT.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. DDT is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) that bioaccumulates in the environment and biomagnifies through food chains.  Its accumulation in the fatty tissues of birds interferes with calcium metabolism, resulting in eggshell thinning and reduced reproductive success, leading to a decline in bird populations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The use of DDT is banned in India due to its significant environmental impact and harmful effects on wildlife. The resurgence of DDT-resistant mosquito strains is a concern, but it does not justify the reinstatement of DDT use.  Alternative control measures are being explored.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Dicofol is a chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide that is chemically related to DDT; it shares a similar structure and properties.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NPCDCS program addresses both prevention and control aspects of the diseases it targets, including cancer.  It encompasses a range of interventions from promoting healthy lifestyles to providing treatment and supportive care.

**1. With reference to genetic disorders, consider the following statements:**

1. Haemophilia A is caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII, while Haemophilia B is caused by a deficiency in clotting factor IX.  Both are inherited through the Y chromosome.
2.  Arsenic poisoning can manifest as diarrhoea, and Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is a common treatment for diarrhoea caused by various factors, including dehydration.
3. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) included the eradication of malaria as a primary objective, and the RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) vaccine is a widely used preventative measure against malaria.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but ultimately incorrect. Haemophilia A and B are indeed caused by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII and IX respectively. However, the crucial error lies in stating that they are inherited through the Y chromosome.  Haemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder inherited through the X chromosome.  Males, having only one X chromosome, are more frequently affected. Females can be carriers but rarely exhibit the full-blown disease.


Statement 2 is correct. Arsenic poisoning is a known cause of diarrhoea, leading to severe dehydration.  ORT is a crucial treatment for rehydration in such cases.  It's important to note that diarrhoea has many causes, but arsenic poisoning is one significant factor.


Statement 3 is partially correct but ultimately incorrect. While the MDGs did target malaria eradication, the claim that RTS,S/AS01 is a widely used *preventative* measure is misleading.  Although it's a malaria vaccine, its efficacy is limited and its widespread use is not yet a reality.  Furthermore,  the statement conflates the goal of the MDGs with a specific vaccine’s effectiveness, creating a potential for confusion.  The MDGs represented a broader approach to tackling malaria, encompassing prevention, treatment, and vector control.


Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the provided information.


**2. With reference to disease vectors and control programs, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anopheles stephensi is the primary mosquito vector for Plasmodium vivax, causing a severe form of malaria prevalent in regions with equatorial climates.
2. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) in India focuses primarily on eliminating malaria by targeting Anopheles mosquitoes through insecticide spraying and larvicide application.  It also includes a comprehensive vaccination strategy using the R21/Matrix-M vaccine.
3. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) classifies malaria under the category of parasitic infections, and gene drive technology is being explored as a potential method for eliminating the Plasmodium parasite.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Anopheles stephensi is indeed a vector for malaria, it is not the *primary* vector for Plasmodium vivax. Several Anopheles species transmit Plasmodium vivax.  Furthermore, the statement incorrectly links Plasmodium vivax to a severe form of malaria. While Plasmodium vivax can cause significant illness, Plasmodium falciparum is generally considered to cause the most severe and potentially fatal form of malaria.  The association with equatorial climates is correct, as these conditions are favorable for mosquito breeding.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NVBDCP does aim to control malaria through vector control measures,  the claim that it includes a comprehensive vaccination strategy using R21/Matrix-M is inaccurate.  The development and deployment of malaria vaccines are still ongoing, and a comprehensive vaccination program is not yet a core component of the NVBDCP.


Statement 3 is correct.  The ICD-11 does classify malaria as a parasitic disease, and gene drive technology is a promising area of research for malaria control by targeting the Plasmodium parasite.  Gene drives aim to alter the genetic makeup of mosquito populations to reduce their ability to transmit malaria.


Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct.



**3. With reference to the applications of biotechnology, consider the following statements:**

1. Fenugreek seeds have been traditionally used to manage diabetes mellitus by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing blood sugar levels, and this traditional use has been validated by modern scientific research utilizing biotechnology.
2.  Biotechnology encompasses a broad range of applications, including the use of organisms or their substances in industrial processes, such as biofuel production enhanced through genetic engineering techniques like CRISPR-Cas9.
3.  Genetic engineering techniques, such as the creation of a larger rat using human growth genes, are examples of crossbreeding, a traditional method of selective breeding that predates modern biotechnology.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Fenugreek seeds *have* been traditionally used in managing diabetes, and modern research supports the traditional use.  Biotechnology plays a role in understanding the mechanisms of action and possibly developing refined extracts or therapies based on fenugreek's properties.


Statement 2 is correct. Biotechnology's applications are vast, encompassing industrial processes (like biofuel production) and genetic engineering (like CRISPR-Cas9).  The statement accurately reflects the scope of the field.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The example of creating a larger rat using human growth genes is a clear example of *genetic engineering*, not crossbreeding. Crossbreeding involves mating organisms of different breeds or varieties, while genetic engineering involves directly manipulating an organism's genes. The statement misrepresents the fundamental difference between these two techniques.


Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.

These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge of the topics and careful analysis of the options to avoid being misled by the distractors.  They aim to test not just factual recall but also the ability to evaluate and analyze information critically, skills essential for success in the UPSC examination.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Polio:**

1.  Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) provides lifelong immunity against all strains of the poliovirus.
2.  Polio is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, with contaminated water being a major vector.
3.  The eradication of polio globally has been hampered by the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While OPV is highly effective, it doesn't guarantee lifelong immunity against all poliovirus strains.  Booster doses are often required to maintain adequate protection, and the immunity conferred can wane over time.  Furthermore, OPV, being a live attenuated vaccine, carries a small risk of causing vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP).

Statement 2 is correct. The fecal-oral route is the primary mode of polio transmission.  Infected individuals shed the virus in their feces, which can contaminate water sources and lead to infection in others who ingest the contaminated water or food.

Statement 3 is correct.  The emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) is a significant challenge to global polio eradication efforts.  cVDPVs arise when the weakened virus in the OPV mutates and regains its ability to cause paralysis.  These viruses can spread in communities with low vaccination coverage, posing a risk even in areas previously considered polio-free.  This highlights the complexity of eradication and the need for sustained high vaccination rates globally.


**2. With reference to the Plague, consider the following statements:**

1.  The bubonic plague is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected fleas residing on rodents.
2.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak actively campaigned for improved sanitation measures to curb the spread of the plague.
3.  Muhammad Tughlaq's army was significantly impacted by a major plague outbreak during his reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The bubonic plague, the most common form of the disease, is transmitted through the bite of infected fleas that have previously fed on infected rodents.  The fleas act as vectors, carrying the *Yersinia pestis* bacteria from the rodents to humans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While there were various responses to the plague outbreaks in India, historical evidence doesn't strongly support Bal Gangadhar Tilak's direct involvement in large-scale sanitation campaigns to combat the plague during that specific period.  His activism primarily focused on other socio-political issues.

Statement 3 is correct.  Historical accounts indicate that a significant plague epidemic severely affected Muhammad Tughlaq's army, contributing to military setbacks and impacting the stability of his reign. This outbreak demonstrates the devastating potential of the disease and its impact on large populations.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ionosphere, a layer of Earth's upper atmosphere, is characterized by a high concentration of ions and free electrons, primarily created by the ionization of atmospheric gases by solar radiation, especially EUV and X-rays.  This ionization is crucial for radio wave propagation, as these charged particles interact with radio waves, enabling long-distance communication.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Communication satellites are not located in the Stratosphere. The Stratosphere is a relatively stable atmospheric layer but is too low for effective global communication.  Communication satellites orbit primarily in the Geostationary orbit, which is above the Ionosphere, in the Exosphere,  to provide continuous coverage over a specific geographical region.


Statement 3 is correct.  Earthquakes can indeed induce disturbances in the Ionosphere. The seismic waves generated during an earthquake can propagate upwards, affecting the ionospheric plasma density and composition. These disturbances can impact radio wave propagation, leading to signal disruptions or anomalies. The precise mechanisms are still under research, but the correlation between significant seismic events and ionospheric perturbations has been observed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PSLV does utilize solid fuel in some of its stages, it's not the primary fuel source.  The PSLV is a four-stage rocket employing a combination of solid and liquid propellants. The initial stages often use solid propellants for their high thrust-to-weight ratio, while later stages may employ liquid propellants for greater control and efficiency.  The cost-effectiveness and reliability are a result of this combined approach, along with ISRO's expertise in developing and integrating these systems.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vikas engine is a liquid-fueled engine, but it's not the sole propulsion system of the PSLV. The PSLV uses multiple engines across its stages, with the Vikas engine powering one or more of its stages, depending on the specific PSLV variant.  Therefore, stating it is the "primary" propulsion system is an oversimplification.


Statement 3 is correct. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) has a proven track record of successful satellite launches.  One notable example is its successful launch of XPoSAT, a satellite carrying the POEM-3 experiment. This highlights the PSLV's versatility and capability to launch a wide range of payloads into different orbits.

2. Mutations, changes in the DNA sequence, are a significant source of genetic variation, contributing to both beneficial and harmful traits.
3. Epigenetic changes, alterations in gene expression without changes to the underlying DNA sequence, do not contribute to heritable variations across generations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct. Asexual reproduction does *not* introduce new genetic material from two parents; it creates clones, resulting in very little genetic variation.  Mutations, however, are a major source of genetic variation, providing the raw material for evolution. While some mutations are harmful, others can be beneficial or neutral, leading to diversity within a population. Statement 3 is incorrect because while epigenetic changes don't alter the DNA sequence itself, some epigenetic modifications *can* be inherited across generations, influencing traits and contributing to heritable variation, albeit in a different way than mutations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bengal Famine, exacerbated by World War II, led to mass migrations and overcrowded refugee camps, creating ideal conditions for malaria transmission.  The disruption of public health infrastructure further worsened the situation, resulting in a significant surge in malaria cases.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Loo, a hot, dry wind prevalent in certain regions of India, can indeed reduce malaria incidence. Its intense heat and dryness significantly limit mosquito breeding by drying out stagnant water sources, which are crucial for mosquito larvae development.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While R21/Matrix-M is a malaria vaccine, it's not exclusively targeted at *Plasmodium falciparum*.  Malaria is caused by several *Plasmodium* species, including *P. falciparum*, *P. vivax*, *P. ovale*, and *P. malariae*.  Vaccines are designed to provide broader protection against multiple species, not just one.  The statement's claim of exclusive targeting is factually inaccurate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The sickle cell trait, a genetic condition causing a milder form of sickle cell disease, offers some protection against malaria.  This is because the altered hemoglobin structure in sickle cell trait carriers inhibits the *Plasmodium* parasite's ability to infect and multiply within red blood cells.  This evolutionary advantage has led to a higher frequency of the sickle cell trait in malaria-prone regions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Plague significantly impacted Muhammad Tughlaq's army, contributing to its weakening and ultimately affecting the stability of his reign.  The army's large size, close quarters, and potentially poor hygiene created conditions conducive to the rapid spread of the disease.  The vulnerability of the population to disease was a factor in the impact.

Statement 3 is correct.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak actively engaged in public health initiatives during the Plague outbreaks in India. He played a crucial role in disseminating information about preventative measures and organizing relief efforts to combat the epidemic.  His support was not limited to mere passive observation but involved direct action in public health.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Helper T cells (Th) do not directly destroy infected cells. That's the role of cytotoxic T cells (Tc).  Helper T cells assist in the activation of both B cells and cytotoxic T cells by releasing cytokines.

Statement 2 is correct. B cell activation leads to the differentiation into plasma cells (antibody-producing) and memory B cells (long-term immunity).  This is a fundamental aspect of humoral immunity.

Statement 3 is correct. APCs are essential for bridging innate and adaptive immunity. They engulf pathogens, process antigens, and present them on their surface via MHC molecules to T cells, initiating T cell activation and subsequent adaptive immune responses.



**3. Consider the following statements concerning Hepatitis viruses:**

1. Hepatitis B virus transmission is similar to that of HIV, primarily through bodily fluids.
2.  There is an effective vaccine available for Hepatitis C, offering robust protection against infection.
3.  Hepatitis A and B infections often remain asymptomatic for many years before manifesting clinical symptoms.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Both Hepatitis B and HIV are transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids (blood, semen, etc.).  This highlights the importance of safe practices in healthcare settings and sexual activity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Currently, there is no vaccine for Hepatitis C.  Treatment focuses on antiviral medications to manage the infection.  Vaccines are available for Hepatitis A and B.

Statement 3 is correct.  Both Hepatitis A and B can have long incubation periods, with individuals remaining asymptomatic for extended periods before symptoms emerge.  This characteristic makes early diagnosis challenging.


**4. With reference to Xenotransplantation, consider the following statements:**

1. Pigs are frequently used as organ donors due to their similar organ anatomy to humans and amenability to genetic modification.
2.  The first attempts at xenotransplantation in humans were largely successful, demonstrating the viability of the technique.
3.  Immunosuppressant drugs are essential post-transplant in xenotransplantation to mitigate the risk of organ rejection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Pigs possess several advantages for xenotransplantation:  anatomical similarity to human organs, relatively fast reproductive cycles, and the feasibility of genetic modification to reduce immunogenicity (the likelihood of rejection).

Statement 2 is incorrect. Early attempts at xenotransplantation were largely unsuccessful due to hyperacute rejection, a rapid immune response against the foreign tissue. This highlights the significant immunological challenges.

Statement 3 is correct.  Because of the substantial difference between the donor and recipient species, strong immunosuppression is necessary after xenotransplantation to prevent the immediate and long-term rejection of the transplanted organ.  


**5. Consider the following statements on Tuberculosis (TB):**

1. BCG vaccine offers complete protection against both pulmonary and extrapulmonary forms of TB.
2. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin.
3. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, all fluoroquinolones, and at least one injectable second-line drug.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BCG vaccine is effective in reducing the incidence of severe forms of TB, particularly in children, but its efficacy against pulmonary TB in adults is limited and variable. It is more effective against extrapulmonary TB.

Statement 2 is correct.  This is the defining characteristic of MDR-TB, a significant public health concern due to treatment challenges.

Statement 3 is correct. XDR-TB represents a higher level of drug resistance than MDR-TB, posing even greater therapeutic difficulties.  The resistance to multiple drug classes severely limits treatment options.

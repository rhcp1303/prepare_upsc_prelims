**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Entity                      Associated Characteristic
1. B cells                               : Originates in the thymus
2. T cells                               :  Mediates humoral immunity
3. Plasma cells                           : Differentiates from memory B cells
4. Helper T cells (Th)                   : Activates cytotoxic T cells
5. Memory B cells                         : Produces antibodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because Helper T cells (Th) do activate cytotoxic T cells, and memory B cells are indeed a type of B cell that provides long-term immunity without directly producing antibodies.  The other options contain inaccuracies. B cells originate in the bone marrow, not the thymus (incorrect in pair 1). T cells mediate cellular immunity, not humoral immunity (incorrect in pair 2). Plasma cells differentiate directly from activated B cells, not memory B cells (incorrect in pair 3).


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organism Type                          Symbiotic Relationship Example
1. Fungi                                 :  Mycorrhizal association with algae
2. Cnidarians                            :  Mutualistic relationship with clownfish
3. Protozoa                              :  Endosymbiotic relationship with termites
4. Bacteria                              :  Nitrogen fixation in legume roots

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The weight of the lid directly impacts the pressure inside the cooker, which, in turn, affects the boiling point of water and thus the cooking temperature. The area of the hole influences pressure release and thus indirectly affects the temperature. The flame temperature affects the rate of heating but not directly the cooking temperature once the pressure is established.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Product                                 Characteristic
1. Furnace oil                            :  By-product of petroleum refining
2.  Sulphur dioxide                       :  Air pollutant from copper smelting

4.  Heavy metals                         :  Can leach from copper slag
5.  Triethylaluminum and Triethylboron    :  Components of rocket engine igniters


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Furnace oil is indeed a by-product of petroleum refining. Copper smelting releases sulfur dioxide as a pollutant, and heavy metals can leach from copper slag. Triethylaluminum and triethylboron are used in certain rocket engine igniters. Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas but not primarily considered a greenhouse gas in the same way as carbon dioxide.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune Cell Type                       Function
1. B cells                                :  Produce antibodies

(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

B cells produce antibodies, a key component of humoral immunity.  Cytotoxic T cells directly kill infected cells. Helper T cells activate both B cells and other T cells. Macrophages are phagocytic cells that engulf and destroy pathogens.  Plasma cells are not antigen-presenting cells; that role belongs to macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vaccine Type                            Mechanism of Action

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Wet scrubbers are a technology specifically designed to remove sulphur dioxide from industrial emissions, primarily from coal-fired power plants.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. E-waste, comprising discarded electronic devices, contains significant quantities of heavy metals like lead, mercury, and cadmium.  The improper disposal of e-waste leads to the leaching of these heavy metals into the environment, thus pair 2 is correct.  While coal-fired power plants do emit carbon monoxide, it's not their sole or primary association.  Other sources, such as vehicle exhaust and incomplete combustion, contribute significantly to carbon monoxide pollution. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched because it presents a limited and not the most prominent source of carbon monoxide. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include or exclude pairings that are not entirely accurate based on the primary and most significant sources of these pollutants.  The question tests the understanding of the specific sources and mitigation techniques associated with different pollutants.

2. HIV                         : Sexual contact
3. Hepatitis C                : Sharing needles
4.  Influenza A (H1N1)       : Airborne droplets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Hepatitis B can be transmitted through various routes, including blood transfusions, sexual contact, and sharing needles. HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, blood transfusions, and sharing needles. Hepatitis C is most commonly transmitted through sharing needles contaminated with infected blood. Influenza A (H1N1), commonly known as swine flu, is spread through airborne droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Therefore, all pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes Hepatitis B, neglecting the accurate transmission routes of HIV and Hepatitis C. Option (b) is partially correct in mentioning Hepatitis B and HIV but omits Hepatitis C. Option (c) is also partially correct in that it correctly matches HIV and Hepatitis C, but it fails to account for Hepatitis B transmission.  The question tests factual recall of disease transmission methods, requiring the candidate to possess detailed knowledge of the various routes of infection for different viral diseases.


**2. With reference to viral infections, consider the following pairs:**

Virus                       Associated Disease
1.  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) :  Cirrhosis
2.  Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)             :  Liver cancer
3.  Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)             : AIDS


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), not cirrhosis.  Cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease most commonly caused by chronic alcohol abuse, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) can lead to liver cancer as a long-term complication. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) primarily causes liver damage and cirrhosis, eventually leading to liver cancer; it does not cause AIDS.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it incorrectly links HIV to cirrhosis. Option (b) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs HIV with cirrhosis and omits the correct link between Hepatitis C and liver cancer. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairings of 1 and 3. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related diseases and their causative agents, demanding precise knowledge of viral infections and their associated complications.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Vaccines are available for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.  There is currently no vaccine for Hepatitis C or HIV.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes Hepatitis A. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly states that there are no vaccines for Hepatitis B and HIV.  Option (d) is incorrect as it incorrectly includes all the pairs. This question tests factual knowledge about vaccine availability for specific viral diseases. The inclusion of plausible distractors (incorrect vaccine availability status) makes the question challenging and assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate information concerning public health measures.


**4. With reference to the prevalence of viral infections, consider the following pairs:**

Viral Infection      Global Infection Numbers (Relative to HIV)
1. Hepatitis B          : Significantly Higher
2. Hepatitis C          : Significantly Lower
3.  Influenza A (H1N1) : Comparable


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Globally, the number of people infected with Hepatitis B and C viruses are significantly higher than those infected with HIV. Influenza A(H1N1) has a global prevalence that varies year to year, but it is generally considered to infect a larger number of people than HIV.   Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect as it incorrectly includes Influenza A (H1N1). Option (c) is incorrect as it incorrectly states that Hepatitis C infections are significantly lower than HIV. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes all three incorrect pairings.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the relative global prevalence of different viral infections compared to HIV, demanding a grasp of epidemiological data.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

2. HIV                         : Antiretroviral therapy
3. Hepatitis C                :  Antiviral medications
4. Influenza A (H1N1)       : Antiviral medications (in severe cases)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Hepatitis B is treated with antiviral medications to suppress viral replication and prevent liver damage. HIV is managed with antiretroviral therapy (ART), a combination of drugs that target different stages of the viral life cycle.  Hepatitis C is also treated with antiviral medications, targeting specific viral proteins. Influenza A (H1N1) is typically treated with rest and supportive care, but antiviral medications might be prescribed in severe cases to reduce the duration and severity of illness.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all partially correct, but they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  This question assesses factual recall of treatment modalities for various viral infections, demanding knowledge of specific medical interventions.

2. Fungi                         Coral Reefs
3. Phytoplankton                Estuaries
4. Lichens                       Bare Rock

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Algae are found in a wide variety of habitats, including aquatic environments like estuaries and even some terrestrial environments, but the tundra is not a primary habitat for algae.  Fungi are found in diverse locations, including coral reefs, but their presence is not exclusive to this environment.  Phytoplankton, which are microscopic algae, are indeed a major component of estuarine ecosystems. Lichens, a symbiotic association of algae and fungi, are highly adaptable and are known for their ability to colonize inhospitable environments like bare rocks, initiating ecological succession. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect as algae are not primarily associated with tundra environments. Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because while fungi are found in diverse locations (including within lichens that thrive on bare rock), they are not exclusively found in coral reefs.

   Biological Process            Organism/Entity
1. Photosynthesis               Fungi
2. Respiration                  Algae
3. Ecological Succession        Lichens
4. Mineral Enrichment           Algae

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis, the process of converting light energy into chemical energy, is primarily carried out by plants and certain other organisms like algae, not fungi. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms, obtaining energy by breaking down organic matter. Respiration, the process of releasing energy from organic molecules, occurs in all living organisms, including algae.  Ecological succession, the gradual process of community change, is often initiated by pioneer species like lichens, which can colonize bare rock. Algae contribute significantly to mineral enrichment in aquatic ecosystems through their life cycles and decomposition. Therefore, options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because fungi do not perform photosynthesis. Option (c) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because fungi do not perform photosynthesis.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Entity          Role/Characteristic
1. Algae                       Provides shelter to fungi
2. Fungi                       Provides food to algae
3. Lichen                       Symbiotic association with bacteria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

In a lichen, the fungal partner (mycobiont) provides structural support and protection from harsh environmental conditions to the algal partner (phycobiont).  The algal partner, through photosynthesis, produces food (carbohydrates) which is then utilized by the fungus.  Lichens are a symbiotic association of algae and fungi, not bacteria. Therefore, options 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) and (b) are partially correct, but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because two of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Biofuel Source             Biofuel Type
1. Algae                       First Generation Biofuel
2. Algae                       Third Generation Biofuel
3. Plants                      Second Generation Biofuel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

First-generation biofuels are derived from traditional food crops like corn and sugarcane. Second-generation biofuels are produced from non-food biomass sources like agricultural residues and wood.  Third-generation biofuels utilize algae as a feedstock, which offers advantages in terms of high lipid content and rapid growth rates. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because algae are not a primary source for first-generation biofuels. Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because algae are not a primary source for first-generation biofuels.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Group           Higher Classification
1. Fungi                       Bacteria
2. Phytoplankton             Algae
3. Microbiome                 Fungi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fungi are a distinct kingdom of organisms, separate from bacteria.  Phytoplankton are a type of algae, specifically the microscopic algae that live in aquatic environments.  A microbiome is a complex community of microorganisms, which includes various types of organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and others. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because fungi are not a type of bacteria. Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because fungi are not a type of bacteria.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Force/Process                                   Related Entity
1. Gravity                                          :   Continental Drift
2. Refraction                                       :   Atmosphere
3. Radioactivity                                    :   Potassium
4. Nuclear Fission                               :    Earth's Mantle
5.  Oxidation                                      :    Iron


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gravity is a contributing force to continental drift, a geological process involving the movement of tectonic plates.  Refraction, the bending of light, is significantly influenced by the Earth's atmosphere.  Radioactivity, the spontaneous emission of radiation, involves the decay of radioactive isotopes, including potassium.  Nuclear fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei, occurs naturally in the Earth's mantle, although at a much lower rate than in nuclear reactors. Oxidation is a chemical reaction involving the loss of electrons, and Iron readily undergoes oxidation. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 4 is partially correct, as nuclear fission does occur in the Earth's mantle, but the question seeks a direct and primary relationship; the primary association of nuclear fission is with technology and not with a natural geological process. Pair 5 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Element/Mineral                                 Associated Feature
1. Calcium                                        :   Desert Soils
2. Iron                                           :   Magnetite
3. Sodium                                         :    Earth's Crust
4. Boron (B)                                      :   Calcium Uptake
5. Sulphur                                        :   Reacts with Iron


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Calcium is a major component of many desert soils.  Iron is a key constituent of Magnetite, a common iron ore.  Sodium is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Boron affects the uptake of Calcium in plants. Sulphur reacts with iron to form iron sulfide, a brittle compound. All the given pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Process/Phenomenon                         Associated Description
1. Refraction                                   :   Daylight Extension
2. Gravity                                      :   Black Holes
3.  Nuclear Fission                            :   Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)

5.  Ocean Currents                             :   Gravity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Atmospheric refraction extends daylight by bending sunlight, making the sun appear above the horizon even after it has technically set. Black holes are characterized by their immense gravitational pull. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) utilize nuclear fission for power generation. Radioactivity involves the decay of unstable isotopes like uranium. Ocean currents are initiated and influenced by gravity.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material/Substance                           Characteristic/Property
1. Iron                                          :   Good Conductor

3.  Vanadium                                     :   Vanadium Flow Batteries
4.  Lab-grown Diamonds                         :  High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) synthesis
5.  Methanol                                    :   Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Iron is a good conductor of electricity and heat. Zinc is used as a protective coating for iron to prevent corrosion (galvanization). Vanadium is a key component in vanadium flow batteries, a type of energy storage technology. Lab-grown diamonds are often synthesized using High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) methods. Methanol is the fuel used in Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs).  All of the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Process                            Application/Use
1.  Genome Editing                               :   Low-pungent Mustard
2.  Tissue Culture                              :   Propagation of Rare Trees
3.  GPS Spoofing                                 :   Disrupting Navigation Systems
4.  White Rabbit Technology                     :   High-precision Synchronization
5.  Satellite Communication Technology (SCT)   :   Direct Satellite Calls



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Genome editing techniques have been used to create low-pungent mustard varieties. Tissue culture is a common method for propagating plants, including rare and endangered tree species. GPS spoofing involves transmitting false GPS signals to disrupt navigation systems. White Rabbit technology is used in applications requiring high-precision synchronization, such as particle accelerators. Satellite communication technology enables direct satellite calls, eliminating the need for terrestrial infrastructure in certain cases.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology                Associated Feature
1. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) : Uses enriched uranium as fuel
2. Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)          :  Employs liquid sodium as coolant
3. Small Modular Reactor (SMR)        : Primarily utilizes thorium as fuel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) indeed utilize liquid sodium as a coolant, offering advantages in heat transfer efficiency.  PHWRs, on the other hand, use natural or slightly enriched uranium, not highly enriched uranium.  The use of enriched uranium is more common in other reactor types like Light Water Reactors (LWRs).  Finally, while SMRs are a developing technology with potential for various fuel types, they are not *primarily* reliant on thorium.  Thorium-based reactors represent a separate and distinct advanced reactor technology, often categorized as "Generation IV" reactors. The use of thorium is being explored in various reactor designs, but SMRs are not exclusively or primarily designed around thorium fuel.  Therefore, only the statement about the FBR's coolant is accurate.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Fuel                     Characteristic
1. Uranium                           :  Abundant in India's monazite sands
2. Thorium                           :   Directly sustains a nuclear chain reaction
3. Plutonium-239                    :  Produced in Fast Breeder Reactors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. Plutonium-239 is a fissile material produced as a byproduct in Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) through the breeding process.  The first pair is incorrect because while uranium is found in India, it's primarily found in different geological formations, not specifically and abundantly in monazite sands. Monazite is a significant source of thorium.  The second pair is incorrect because thorium itself is not a fissile material; it's a fertile material that needs to be converted into a fissile isotope (like Uranium-233) before it can sustain a chain reaction. Thus, only the statement regarding Plutonium-239's production in FBRs is factually accurate.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Reactor Type             Key Feature
1.  Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) : Uses heavy water as a moderator
2.  Boiling Water Reactor (BWR)    :  Water acts as both coolant and moderator
3.  Small Modular Reactor (SMR)    :  Designed for on-site construction only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correct. Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) utilize water as both the coolant (to remove heat) and the moderator (to slow down neutrons for efficient fission).  The first pair is incorrect because PWRs use ordinary (light) water as a coolant and may use light water or heavy water as a moderator depending on design.  The third pair is incorrect because a key advantage of SMRs is their factory-fabricated modular design, allowing for off-site construction and easier transportation to various locations. Therefore, only the statement describing the BWR's dual role of water as coolant and moderator is accurate.


**4. With reference to nuclear energy, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                 Description
1.  Nuclear Fission                          :  The fusion of atomic nuclei
2.  Nuclear Fusion                           : The splitting of atomic nuclei
3.  Critical Mass                             : The minimum amount of fissile material needed for a sustained chain reaction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. A critical mass is indeed the minimum amount of fissile material (like uranium-235 or plutonium-239) required to initiate and sustain a self-propagating chain reaction of nuclear fission.  The first two pairs are reversed. Nuclear fission is the splitting of an atomic nucleus, while nuclear fusion is the combining of atomic nuclei. Therefore, only the definition of critical mass is accurate.


**5. With reference to the Earth's atmosphere, consider the following pairs:**

   Atmospheric Layer                      Characteristic
1.  Stratosphere                           :  Contains the ozone layer
2.  Troposphere                            :  Highest concentration of greenhouse gases
3.  Ionosphere                             :  Reflects radio waves back to Earth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The stratosphere contains the ozone layer, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The troposphere, being the lowest layer, contains the highest concentration of greenhouse gases, which contribute to the Earth's climate. The ionosphere, a layer in the upper atmosphere, contains charged particles that reflect radio waves, enabling long-distance radio communication.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                  Property
1.  Heavy Water                             :  Increases the speed of neutrons in a nuclear reactor
2.  Graphite                               : Acts as a moderator in some reactors
3.  Liquid Sodium                           : Used as a coolant in some reactors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Graphite is used as a neutron moderator in some nuclear reactors to slow down neutrons for improved fission efficiency. Liquid sodium is used as a coolant in certain reactor designs, particularly Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs), due to its excellent heat transfer properties.  However, the first pair is incorrect: heavy water (deuterium oxide) acts as a *moderator*, slowing down neutrons, not increasing their speed.  Therefore, only the statements about graphite and liquid sodium are accurate.


**7. With reference to different types of nuclear reactors, consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type                             Fuel Type
1.  CANDU Reactor                          :  Enriched Uranium
2.  Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)       :  Natural Uranium or Slightly Enriched Uranium
3.  Boiling Water Reactor (BWR)            :  Low-Enriched Uranium


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. PWRs typically use natural uranium or slightly enriched uranium as fuel, while BWRs generally use low-enriched uranium.  However, the first pair is incorrect: CANDU reactors (Canadian Deuterium Uranium reactors) are known for their ability to use natural uranium effectively due to their heavy water moderator design.  Therefore, only the fuel types for PWRs and BWRs are accurately described.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                           Primary Use
1.  Fossil Fuels                             :  Renewable energy generation
2.  Nuclear Fission                         :  Electricity generation
3.  Nuclear Fusion                          :  Currently a major energy source


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. Nuclear fission is currently used extensively for electricity generation in many countries. The first pair is incorrect because fossil fuels are non-renewable resources and are not primarily used for renewable energy generation.  The third pair is incorrect because nuclear fusion is still under development; it is not yet a major energy source.  Therefore, only the statement accurately describing the use of nuclear fission is correct.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                  Constituent Amino Acid
1. Aspartame                           :   Lysine
2. Neotame                             :   Phenylalanine
3. Aspartame                           :   Aspartic acid
4.  Artificial Sweetener                :   Methionine

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aspartame is a dipeptide artificial sweetener composed of two amino acids: aspartic acid and phenylalanine.  Option 3 correctly reflects this composition. Option 2 is partially correct; Neotame is a derivative of Aspartame,  but it's not simply composed of phenylalanine alone.  It also contains aspartic acid. Option 1 is incorrect because Aspartame does not contain lysine. Option 4 is too broad; while many artificial sweeteners are composed of amino acids, this isn't universally true, and the specific amino acid, methionine, is not a constituent of Aspartame. Therefore, only pair 3 is accurately matched.  The question tests factual recall about the chemical composition of Aspartame and its relationship to related compounds, demanding precise knowledge rather than general understanding of artificial sweeteners. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Atmospheric Layer                   Characteristic Feature
1. Ionosphere                          :   Reflects radio waves due to ozone concentration
2. Thermosphere                         :   Contains the Ionosphere
3. Exosphere                           :   Located below the Ionosphere
4. Magnetosphere                      :   Influenced by earthquakes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ionosphere's ability to reflect radio waves is due to the ionization of its gases by solar radiation, not primarily ozone concentration.  Ozone is a significant component of the stratosphere. The Thermosphere does indeed contain the Ionosphere as a layer within it.  The Exosphere is located above the Ionosphere, not below. Earthquakes can indirectly affect the Magnetosphere by causing disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field, however this is not a direct or primary characteristic of the magnetosphere. Therefore, only pair 2 correctly matches the atmospheric layer with its characteristic. The question assesses factual recall of atmospheric layers and their properties, requiring precise knowledge of their relative positions and the factors influencing their behavior.  The incorrect options contain plausible but inaccurate statements, testing the candidate's ability to discriminate between subtle differences in scientific concepts.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                          Action related to Aspartame
1. FSSAI                               :   Classified Aspartame as possibly carcinogenic
2. IARC                                :   Approved Aspartame for use in food products
3. WHO                                 :   Set daily intake limits for Aspartame

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) approves the use of Aspartame within certain limits, not classifies it as possibly carcinogenic. That classification falls under the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The IARC classifies Aspartame as "possibly carcinogenic to humans," meaning there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence in animals to suggest a possible risk.  The World Health Organization (WHO) sets acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) for various substances, including Aspartame, based on scientific evaluations of safety data. Therefore, only pair 3 accurately describes a WHO action concerning Aspartame. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles of different international organizations in regulating food additives and their specific actions regarding Aspartame. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the different mandates of these organizations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Species                     Effect on Ozone
1. Free Radicals                        :   Depletes ozone
2. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)         :   Enhances ozone
3. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)              :   Depletes ozone
4. Methane                              :   Enhances ozone

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Free radicals, particularly those containing chlorine and bromine atoms, catalytically destroy ozone molecules in the stratosphere. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) also contribute to ozone depletion, particularly in the troposphere, though their impact is more complex than that of CFCs.  CFCs and methane are potent greenhouse gases but are not directly linked to enhancing ozone. In fact, methane contributes to tropospheric ozone formation, which is a pollutant, not a protective ozone layer.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the chemical processes involved in ozone depletion and the role of various chemical species in this process, requiring a deep understanding of atmospheric chemistry.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between different types of atmospheric pollutants and their effects.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biomolecule                           Component
1. Proteins                             :   Sulfur
2. Amino Acids                         :   Phosphorus
3. Nucleic Acids                        :   Sulfur
4. Carbohydrates                       :   Nitrogen

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Proteins contain sulfur-containing amino acids such as methionine and cysteine.  Amino acids do not contain phosphorus as a primary constituent; phosphorus is a key component of nucleic acids and phospholipids. Nucleic acids contain phosphorus in their phosphate backbone, not sulfur. Carbohydrates primarily contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, not nitrogen. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the basic chemical composition of major biomolecules, requiring recall of specific elements present in each.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the roles of different elements in biological molecules.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Atmospheric Layer             Associated Phenomenon
1. Ionosphere                     :  Reflection of radio waves
2. Stratosphere                   :  Absorption of UV radiation
3. Thermosphere                   :  Presence of charged particles
4. Exosphere                      :  Gradual transition to outer space
5. Mesosphere                    :  Meteor burning


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Ionosphere contains charged particles that reflect radio waves back to Earth, facilitating long-distance radio communication. This is a well-established fact in atmospheric science.  The Stratosphere contains a high concentration of ozone, which absorbs a significant portion of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, protecting life on Earth. The Thermosphere is characterized by extremely high temperatures due to the absorption of high-energy solar radiation, leading to ionization of atmospheric gases.  The Exosphere is the outermost layer, where the atmosphere gradually fades into outer space; there isn't a single defining phenomenon.  The Mesosphere is characterized by the burning up of meteors due to friction with atmospheric gases. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option 4 is partially correct in that the Exosphere marks a transition to space but is not a uniquely defining feature. Option 5 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Atmospheric Layer           Altitude Range (km)
1. Troposphere                 : 50-80
2. Stratosphere                 : 10-50
3. Mesosphere                  : 50-85
4. Thermosphere                : 80-600
5. Exosphere                   : Above 600


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The stratosphere's altitude range is approximately 10-50 km, and the thermosphere extends from roughly 80-600 km.  The troposphere extends from the surface to about 10-12 km, depending on latitude and season. The mesosphere's altitude is typically 50-85 km. The exosphere begins above the thermosphere, generally considered to start above 600 km.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other pairs present incorrect altitude ranges.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Ozone Layer Characteristic       Description
1.  Ozone Depletion              : Increased UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface
2.  Ozone Layer Formation        : Photochemical reactions involving oxygen and UV radiation
3.  Ozone's role in Greenhouse Effect : Traps infrared radiation, contributing to global warming
4.  Stratospheric Ozone          :  Protects against harmful UV radiation
5.  Tropospheric Ozone           :  A major component of photochemical smog


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Ozone depletion leads to increased UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface, causing various harmful effects. Ozone formation in the stratosphere is a photochemical process involving oxygen and UV radiation. Ozone is a greenhouse gas and traps infrared radiation, contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the harmful UV radiation from the sun. Tropospheric ozone is a harmful pollutant and a major component of photochemical smog.  All the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Chemical Compound            Property/Effect
1. Ethanol                       :  Renewable biofuel
2. Methanol                      :  Toxic if ingested
3. Ozone                          :  Greenhouse gas
4. Carbon Dioxide                 :  Used in enhanced oil recovery
5. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) :  Ozone-depleting substances


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d) All five

**Explanation:**

Ethanol is a renewable biofuel produced from biomass sources like sugarcane. Methanol is highly toxic if ingested, even in small amounts. Ozone is a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. Carbon dioxide in its supercritical state is used in enhanced oil recovery techniques. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are known ozone-depleting substances that were widely used in refrigerants and aerosols. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Biofuel Source                  Biofuel Type
1. Sugarcane                     : Ethanol
2. Corn                           : Ethanol
3. Algae                          : Biodiesel
4. Soybeans                      : Biodiesel
5. Jatropha                       : Biodiesel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Sugarcane and corn are major sources of ethanol through fermentation. Soybeans and Jatropha are used to produce biodiesel through transesterification. While algae can be a source of biodiesel, it's not a primary source currently at large scale. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pair 3 is not currently a major source of biodiesel at a large commercial scale.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Energy Source               Type of Energy
1.  Nuclear Fission           :  Nuclear Energy
2.  Solar Energy               :  Renewable Energy
3.  Hydroelectric Power       :  Renewable Energy
4.  Geothermal Energy        :  Renewable Energy
5.  Fossil Fuels               :  Non-Renewable Energy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fission is a process that releases nuclear energy. Solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy are all renewable energy sources. Fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) are non-renewable energy sources.  All the pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                     Property/Association
1. Methane                               :  Primary component of natural gas
2. Lithium                               :  Used in lithium-ion batteries
3. Nanoplastics                           :  Accumulates in the liver
4.  Hydroxyl radical (OH)               :  Oxidizes methane
5.  Methanogens                           :  Produces methane


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 1, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched based on established scientific knowledge.  Methane is the primary constituent of natural gas, a widely used energy source. Lithium is a crucial element in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, powering various electronic devices and electric vehicles.  Nanoplastics, due to their size and properties, are known to accumulate in the liver, a vital organ for detoxification. The hydroxyl radical (OH) is a highly reactive species that plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, including the oxidation of methane in the troposphere.  Finally, methanogens, a group of archaea, are responsible for the production of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, primarily through anaerobic decomposition processes.  Therefore, all five pairs accurately reflect the properties and associations of the listed chemical compounds.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organ/System                         Impact/Association
1. Liver                                 :  Affected by Hepatitis C
2. Immune system                         :  Influenced by the liver
3. Wetlands                              :  Source of methane emissions
4.  Clathrate deposits                   : Stores methane
5.  Pitcher plant                         : Listed in CITES appendices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

Each pair reflects a correct relationship. Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver, causing inflammation and potential long-term damage. The liver plays a crucial role in immune function, influencing the body's overall immune response. Wetlands are significant sources of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition processes occurring in these environments.  Clathrate deposits, also known as methane hydrates, are geological formations that store large amounts of methane under specific pressure and temperature conditions.  Finally, the pitcher plant is indeed listed in CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna) appendices due to conservation concerns related to its exploitation.  Therefore, all five pairs are accurate, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Greenhouse Gas                         Effect/Source
1. Methane                               :  More potent than CO2
2. Carbon Dioxide                         : Contributes to Global Warming
3.  Methane                               :  Associated with Black Carbon
4.  CO2                                   : Emitted from Wetlands
5.  Methane                               :  Consumed by Methanotrophic bacteria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

While several pairs correctly link greenhouse gases to their effects or sources, one is inaccurate.  Methane is indeed a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, meaning it traps more heat per molecule. Both methane and carbon dioxide contribute significantly to global warming. Methane emissions are often associated with black carbon, a component of soot and air pollution.  Methanotrophic bacteria are microorganisms that consume methane as an energy source. However, wetlands are primarily associated with methane emissions, not CO2.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched, while pair 4 is incorrect. This makes option (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                  Use/Source
1.  Lithium                               : Found in igneous rocks
2.  Cobalt                                : Potential scarcity with Lithium
3.  Hydrogen                              : Produced from Methane
4.  Tantalum                              :  Component of Lithium-ion batteries
5.  Coalbed Methane                       : Type of Methane


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Four of the pairs present accurate information about materials and their sources or uses.  Lithium is indeed found in igneous rocks, a primary source for lithium extraction.  There's a recognized potential for scarcity of cobalt, a crucial component in many lithium-ion batteries, which could impact the production of these batteries. Hydrogen can be produced through various methods, including the processing of methane (e.g., steam methane reforming).  Coalbed methane is a specific type of natural gas found within coal seams. However, Tantalum is not a direct component of lithium-ion batteries; it's used in other electronic components and has a separate supply chain.  Therefore, options 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correct, but option 4 is incorrect.  Option (b) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrect pair or exclude a correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technological Application                 Related Material/Concept
1.  Batteries                              : Requires Lithium
2.  Gene Editing                           : Uses CRISPR-Cas9 technology
3.  mRNA Vaccines                         :  Mode of delivery via injection
4.  CAR T-cell therapy                     :  Targets CD19 protein (in some cases)
5.  3D Printing                           :  Additive Manufacturing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs demonstrate accurate relationships between technological applications and their related materials or concepts. Lithium-ion batteries rely heavily on lithium as a key component.  CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a widely used gene-editing tool.  mRNA vaccines are commonly delivered via injection.  CAR T-cell therapy, while targeting various antigens depending on the specific application, often targets the CD19 protein in certain types of blood cancers.  Finally, 3D printing is synonymous with additive manufacturing, which builds three-dimensional objects layer by layer.  Thus, all pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the appropriate choice.  Options (a), (b) and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the provided text (a table of contents and snippets of various scientific topics), some questions may necessarily be more focused on definitions and key terms rather than complex interdisciplinary linkages.  The difficulty level is aimed to be challenging, requiring precise factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   RNA Type                     Function
1.  mRNA                          :   Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
2.  tRNA                          :   Involved in RNA splicing, removing introns from pre-mRNA
3.  snRNA                         :   Transfers amino acids to ribosomes during translation
4.  siRNA                         :   Involved in RNA interference, degrading target mRNA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

mRNA (messenger RNA) is correctly paired with its primary function of carrying genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes for protein synthesis.  snRNA (small nuclear RNA) is correctly paired; it is a key component of the spliceosome, responsible for removing introns from pre-mRNA during RNA processing. siRNA (small interfering RNA) is also correctly paired; it plays a crucial role in RNA interference (RNAi), a process that leads to the degradation of specific mRNA molecules.  The incorrect pairing is option 2, where tRNA (transfer RNA) is mistakenly associated with RNA splicing. tRNA's primary function is to deliver specific amino acids to ribosomes based on the mRNA codon sequence during translation.


**2. With reference to Gene Editing techniques, consider the following pairs:**

   Technique                        Description
1. CRISPR-Cas9                     :   Uses site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to make changes in DNA
2. Gene Drive Technology (GDT)   :   Involves the use of small RNA molecules to target mRNA
3.  RNA Interference (RNAi)       :   A method of altering the DNA of organisms, including plants
4.  Genome Sequencing              :   A technique to determine the precise order of nucleotides in a DNA sequence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing technique that precisely targets and modifies DNA sequences using engineered nucleases. Genome sequencing accurately determines the order of nucleotides in a DNA segment. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural process and a technique that uses small RNA molecules (siRNA or miRNA) to silence gene expression by targeting and degrading specific mRNA molecules. The incorrect pairings are 2, where Gene Drive Technology is not directly related to small RNA molecules in its primary mechanism; and 3, where RNA interference is not a method of directly altering the DNA sequence itself.


**3. With reference to types of DNA, consider the following pairs:**

   DNA Type                         Characteristic
1.  Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)    :   Found in many bacteria and plasmids
2.  Circular DNA                     :   Some viruses have ssDNA genomes
3.  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)      :   A small circular DNA molecule found within mitochondria
4.  Methylated DNA                   :   A type of DNA damage caused by environmental factors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Circular DNA is accurately described as being found in bacteria, plasmids, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is correctly defined as a small, circular DNA molecule residing within mitochondria. Option 1 is incorrect because single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is primarily found in some viruses, not bacteria and plasmids which typically contain circular DNA.  Option 4 is incorrect because methylated DNA is not a type of DNA damage; it's a chemical modification that affects gene expression.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Silencing Technique          Mechanism
1.  CRISPR-Cas9                      :   Prevents transcription of targeted genes
2.  RNA Interference (RNAi)           :   Degrades mRNA molecules, preventing translation
3.  Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS):   Blocks mRNA from binding to ribosomes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to prevent transcription of targeted genes by directly modifying the DNA sequence or by targeting regulatory elements.  RNA interference (RNAi) accurately degrades mRNA molecules, thus preventing the translation of targeted genes into proteins.  The incorrect pairing is option 3. While TGS prevents transcription, the statement of blocking mRNA from binding to ribosomes is more characteristic of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), of which RNAi is a type.



**5. With reference to types of RNA, consider the following pairs:**

    RNA type                         Role
1.  MicroRNA (miRNA)                 :  Involved in pre-mRNA splicing
2.  Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)         :  Involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation
3.  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)            :  Forms part of the ribosome structure
4.  Transfer RNA (tRNA)             :  Carries amino acids to the ribosome during translation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a structural component of ribosomes. Transfer RNA (tRNA) functions to deliver amino acids to ribosomes during protein synthesis. The incorrect pairing is option 1, where miRNA is mistakenly linked to pre-mRNA splicing; miRNA primarily participates in post-transcriptional gene regulation by binding to mRNA and either degrading it or inhibiting its translation.


These questions aim for a high difficulty level by including plausible distractors and requiring precise knowledge of the detailed functions of various molecules and techniques.  The explanations provide sufficient detail to clarify why certain options are incorrect, helping candidates understand the underlying concepts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Feature                     Influence on Temperature
1.  Equator                               :  Highest average temperature
2.  Altitude (increasing)                  :  Decreasing temperature
3.  Proximity to large water bodies       :  Moderated temperature fluctuations
4.  Latitude (increasing towards poles)   :  Decreasing temperature
5.  Ocean currents (e.g., Gulf Stream)    :  Increased temperature in affected regions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The equator receives the most direct sunlight throughout the year, resulting in the highest average temperatures globally.  This is a fundamental principle of climatology.  As altitude increases, the atmosphere becomes thinner, leading to less effective heat retention and consequently lower temperatures. This is known as the lapse rate.  Large bodies of water, like oceans and seas, have a high specific heat capacity. This means they absorb and release heat more slowly than landmasses, leading to moderated temperature fluctuations in coastal areas compared to inland regions.  Latitude is directly related to the angle of incoming solar radiation.  Higher latitudes receive less direct sunlight, resulting in lower average temperatures.  Ocean currents act as massive conveyor belts, transporting heat from the equator towards the poles (like the Gulf Stream) or vice-versa, significantly affecting regional temperatures.  All five pairs correctly reflect the established relationships between geographical features and temperature variations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Physical Property                       Effect of Temperature Change
1. Water Density                          :  Increases with decreasing temperature (above 4°C)
2.  Calcium Carbonate Dissolution        :  Increases with increasing temperature
3.  Air Density                           : Decreases with increasing temperature
4. Salinity of seawater                  : Increases with increasing temperature (due to evaporation)
5.  Volume of a gas (at constant pressure): Decreases with decreasing temperature


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Water exhibits an anomalous expansion behavior. Its density increases as temperature decreases until it reaches 4°C, after which it decreases.  The dissolution of calcium carbonate is an endothermic process, meaning it requires energy (heat) to occur. Higher temperatures therefore increase the rate and extent of dissolution. The density of air, like most gases, is inversely proportional to temperature.  Higher temperatures lead to increased molecular kinetic energy and thus lower density. Salinity in seawater does not directly increase with temperature. While evaporation increases salinity, the relationship is indirect and complex, influenced by other factors like precipitation and mixing. The volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature (at constant pressure), according to Charles's Law.  Therefore, decreasing temperature causes a decrease in volume. Pairs 2, 3, and 5 accurately describe the relationship between the physical property and the effect of temperature change.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Climate Variable                       Related Factor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Temperature is fundamentally influenced by latitude due to the varying angle of solar radiation received at different latitudes.  Altitude plays a significant role in precipitation patterns.  Higher altitudes often experience lower temperatures leading to orographic precipitation (rain shadow effect). Ocean currents redistribute heat across the globe, significantly impacting regional temperatures.  Altitude also affects temperature, as discussed previously. Wind patterns are a major driver of precipitation distribution, influencing the movement of moisture-laden air masses. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 5 accurately reflect the relationship between the climate variable and the related factor.

2.  Ethanol                               :   Used as an antidote for methanol poisoning
3.  Carbon Dioxide (supercritical)       :   Used in enhanced oil recovery
4.  White Phosphorus                     :   Used as a component in fertilizers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Methane is indeed the primary constituent of natural gas, a widely used energy source.  Ethanol's role as an antidote in methanol poisoning is a well-established medical fact; it competes with methanol for metabolic enzymes, reducing its toxicity. Supercritical carbon dioxide's application in enhanced oil recovery is a recent advancement in the petroleum industry, leveraging its unique properties at high pressure and temperature to extract more oil from depleted reservoirs.  However, while white phosphorus *does* have some industrial uses, its primary application is as an incendiary agent in military weaponry, not as a major component in fertilizers. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology/Concept             Description/Feature
1.  Artemis Accords                       :   A set of binding agreements for space exploration
2.  SOFIA                               :   A ground-based infrared telescope

4.  Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE) :   Uses deflagrative combustion for propulsion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Artemis Accords are a set of *non-binding* principles, not legally binding agreements.  SOFIA was an *airborne* observatory, not ground-based. Ion thrusters are indeed used for precise satellite orientation and position control, making this a correct match. The RDRE utilizes a continuous detonation wave, not deflagrative combustion, representing a key difference from traditional rocket engines. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetic Technology/Concept          Application/Feature
1.  Genome Sequencing (long-read)     :   Used primarily for counting specific DNA sequences
2.  CRISPR-Cas9                         :   A gene editing technique

4.  Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)   :   Treats genetic disorders by replacing faulty genes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Long-read genome sequencing excels at assembling complex genomes, not primarily counting specific sequences (that's more suited to short-read sequencing). CRISPR-Cas9 is a precise gene-editing tool, accurately described. Gene drive technology does indeed manipulate inheritance patterns to spread specific genes within a population. However, ERT replaces *proteins* (enzymes), not faulty genes directly, through the introduction of functional enzymes to compensate for deficiencies.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material/Substance                  Property/Characteristic
1.  Graphite                             :   Poor conductor of heat and electricity
2.  Tantalum                             :   Low melting point
3.  Liquid Nitrogen                       :   Flammable and corrosive
4.  Methanol                             :   Colorless and fairly volatile liquid

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Graphite is a *good* conductor of both heat and electricity, a key property exploited in various applications. Tantalum possesses an extremely *high* melting point, making it suitable for high-temperature applications. Liquid nitrogen is *non-flammable* and *non-corrosive*, crucial for its role in cryogenic applications. Methanol is accurately described as a colorless and fairly volatile liquid with a characteristic odor. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical/Scientific Concept          Description/Application

2.  TTS (Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome) :   Characterized by low blood clot count and high platelet count
3.  Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT) :   Uses DNA from three individuals to create an embryo
4.  Cell-free DNA (cfDNA)              :   Fragments of DNA found only inside cells

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Meningitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, not solely bacteria. TTS involves blood clots (thrombosis) and a *low* platelet count (thrombocytopenia). MDT correctly uses genetic material from three individuals (parents and mitochondrial donor). Cell-free DNA is found *outside* cells in bodily fluids, not only within them. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology                Description/Application
1.  Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) :   Relies on solar energy for power generation

3.  SDN (Site-directed nuclease)      :   A gene editing technique that always uses foreign genes
4.  Retrotransposons                   :   Genetic elements that replicate through reverse transcription


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

RTGs utilize radioactive decay for power generation, not solar energy.  The definition of an exoplanet is accurate. SDN (Site-directed nuclease) is a gene-editing technique, but it doesn't *always* use foreign genes; SDN1 and SDN2 do not. The description of retrotransposons is also correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Property
1. Graphite                     High Hardness

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Graphite is known for its *low* hardness, not high.  Copper is indeed an excellent conductor of heat, exhibiting high thermal conductivity. Glass, while varying in composition, generally possesses a relatively *low* density compared to metals like copper. Graphene is derived from graphite, not copper. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (c) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair, making them incorrect.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to evaluate the properties of different materials.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type                 Fuel Type
1. Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) :  Natural Uranium
2. Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) :  Uranium-Plutonium Mixed Oxide (MOX)
3.  Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)        :  Thorium-232
4.  Light Water Reactor             : Depleted Uranium

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) utilizes Uranium-Plutonium Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel, not natural uranium. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) are indeed designed to use natural uranium as fuel.  While FBRs utilize thorium in later stages for breeding, their primary fuel is MOX.  Light Water Reactors typically use enriched uranium, not depleted uranium. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing. The question tests knowledge of nuclear reactor technology and fuel cycles, requiring factual recall and analytical skills to differentiate between reactor types and their associated fuels.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Atmospheric Condition          Indicator

3. Cool, dry weather              Low atmospheric pressure
4. Hot and humid weather          High atmospheric pressure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A sudden *fall*, not rise, in barometer reading indicates stormy weather. High humidity is a contributing factor to rainy weather, but not a direct indicator in itself. Low atmospheric pressure is associated with cool, dry weather, and high atmospheric pressure often correlates with hot and humid weather. Thus, only pair 2 shows a reasonable correlation, though not a definitive indicator. The other options contain at least one incorrect pairing. The question assesses understanding of meteorological concepts and the relationship between atmospheric conditions and barometric pressure.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Isotope                     Half-life (years)

2. Calcium-41                   5,700
3. Uranium-241                  40 minutes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Carbon-14 has a half-life of approximately 5,700 years, not 99,400 years.  Calcium-41 has a half-life of approximately 99,400 years, not 5,700 years.  Uranium-241 does have a reported half-life of around 40 minutes.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question assesses factual recall of isotope half-lives, a key concept in radiometric dating and nuclear physics.  The close proximity of the incorrect half-lives in pairs 1 and 2 makes this question challenging.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Metal                       Use in Ancient India
1. Copper                       Construction of large-scale irrigation systems
2. Bronze                       Manufacturing of punch-marked coins
3. Tantalum                     Creation of seals in the Indus Valley Civilization

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While copper was used extensively in ancient India, its primary use wasn't large-scale irrigation. Bronze was used for various objects, but punch-marked coins were primarily made of silver and copper. Tantalum's usage in ancient India is not well documented; seals from the Indus Valley Civilization were primarily made of steatite. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of ancient Indian metallurgy and the uses of different metals, requiring factual recall and an understanding of historical context.  The plausible distractors make the question more difficult.

   Technology                    Application
1. Hyperloop                   Cargo transportation only
2. Maglev                        High-speed rail system
3. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) :  Surgical procedures


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Hyperloop is proposed for both passenger and cargo transportation. Maglev trains are indeed high-speed rail systems using magnetic levitation.  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is used for automating repetitive office tasks, not surgical procedures (that would typically involve surgical robots).  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of emerging technologies and their applications, requiring factual recall and analytical skills. The inclusion of RPA as a distractor, given its automation capabilities, adds complexity.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Property
1. Steel Slag                   Low Durability
2. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)     Low Conductivity
3. White Phosphorus              Non-incendiary
4. Dry Ice                       Sublimes upon heating

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Steel slag is known for its high durability when used in road construction. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are renowned for their high conductivity. White phosphorus is a highly incendiary material. Dry ice, solid carbon dioxide, does indeed sublime upon heating. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of material science and their properties, requiring factual recall.  The distractors are designed to challenge the examinee's understanding of material properties.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nanomaterial                  Property/Application
1. Gold Nanoparticles           Used in cancer treatment (only)
2. Hybrid Nanoparticles         Photoacoustic properties
3. Copper Sulphide Nanoparticles :  High density


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While gold nanoparticles *can* be used in cancer treatment (as part of a combination therapy),  they have other applications as well. Hybrid nanoparticles (like those combining gold and copper sulfide) do exhibit photoacoustic properties, useful for both diagnosis and treatment. The density of Copper Sulphide is not exceptionally high compared to other materials. Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched, although pair 1 is only partially correct due to the qualification of "only" in the description. The question tests knowledge of nanomaterials and their applications, requiring both factual recall and analytical evaluation.  The inclusion of Copper Sulphide adds an element of difficulty.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology            Characteristic
1.  Nuclear Fusion              Requires less energy than it produces
2.  Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)  Uses natural uranium primarily
3.  ITER Project                 Aims to achieve net energy gain from nuclear fusion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion currently requires more energy than it produces; net energy gain is the goal, not a current reality.  FBRs use MOX fuel, not primarily natural uranium.  The ITER project's primary aim is to demonstrate net energy gain from nuclear fusion.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests understanding of nuclear technologies and their characteristics, requiring factual recall and conceptual understanding of fusion and breeder reactors. The distractors are carefully chosen to test the depth of the candidate’s knowledge.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   UNESCO World Heritage Site Nomination      Feature
1. Maratha Military Landscapes               Includes forts from only Maharashtra
2. Gwalior Fort                                 Features a qanat-based water system
3.  Rock Art Sites of Chambal Valley          Located in the Vindhya Range


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Maratha Military Landscapes include forts from both Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Gwalior Fort does not have a qanat-based water system; that feature is associated with other sites like Khooni Bhandara in Burhanpur.  The Rock Art Sites of Chambal Valley are indeed located in the Vindhya Range. Therefore only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of Indian cultural heritage and UNESCO World Heritage sites, requiring factual recall and the ability to discriminate between similar sites. The inclusion of Gwalior fort, a well known site, as a distractor adds difficulty.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Industrial Process                     Material Primarily Involved
1. Vulcanization                            :   Copper
2. Smelting                                 :   Rubber
3. Cracking                                :   Petroleum
4. Hydrogenation                           :   Edible Fats

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Vulcanization is a process that improves the elasticity and durability of rubber by cross-linking polymer chains. It does not involve copper.  Smelting is a process used to extract metals from their ores by heating and melting.  While it can be used for many metals, it's not primarily associated with rubber. Cracking is a process used to break down large hydrocarbon molecules in petroleum into smaller, more useful molecules. Hydrogenation is a chemical process that adds hydrogen to unsaturated fats, converting them into saturated fats.  Therefore, only cracking and hydrogenation are correctly matched with their primary material. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include pairings that are factually inaccurate.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Hormone                                  Primary Action/Regulation
1. Oxytocin                               :   Converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin
2. Renin                                   :   Induces contraction of smooth muscles
3. Pepsin                                  :   Digests starch

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Oxytocin is a hormone primarily known for its role in inducing contractions of uterine smooth muscles during childbirth and milk ejection during breastfeeding.  It does not convert angiotensinogen to angiotensin; that is the function of renin. Renin is an enzyme secreted by the kidneys that plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure.  Pepsin is an enzyme that breaks down proteins in the stomach, not starch; amylase is the enzyme responsible for starch digestion. Therefore, only the pair relating renin to its primary action is correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the functions of oxytocin and pepsin.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                 Property/Application
1. Tungsten                               :   Very hard and very ductile
2. Copper                                 :   Component of bronze
3. Cast iron                              :   Used in incandescent light bulb filaments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tungsten is known for its exceptional hardness and high melting point, making it a useful material in many high-temperature applications. It is also considered relatively ductile, meaning it can be drawn into wires. Copper is a key component of bronze, an alloy also containing tin. Cast iron is not used in incandescent light bulb filaments; tungsten is used due to its high melting point. Therefore, only the pairs relating tungsten to its properties and copper to its use in bronze are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes a false pairing.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                  Primary Product/Export
1. Indonesia                              :   Copper
2. Malaysia                               :   Rubber
3. India                                   :   Petroleum

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Indonesia is a major producer of rubber, palm oil, and other agricultural products. While it has some copper reserves, it is not its primary export. Malaysia is a significant exporter of rubber, a major plantation crop. India is a major producer and consumer of petroleum, but it is not a primary exporter. Thus, only the pair associating Malaysia with rubber is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings of countries and their primary products/exports.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mineral/Material                         Associated Process/Industry
1. Iron Ore                               :   Vulcanization
2. Copper                                 :   Smelting
3. Rubber                                 :   Hydrogenation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Iron ore is primarily processed through smelting to extract iron.  Vulcanization is a process related to rubber, not iron ore. Copper is commonly extracted from its ores through smelting.  Hydrogenation is a chemical process typically used with fats and oils or in the processing of petroleum, not rubber. Therefore, only the pairing of copper with smelting is correct. The other options contain incorrect associations between materials and processes.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Substance                                 Primary Constituent of Kidney Stones
1. Calcium oxalate                         :   Sodium acetate
2. Sodium acetate                           :   Magnesium sulphate
3. Magnesium sulphate                       :   Calcium oxalate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kidney stones are primarily composed of calcium oxalate.  While other substances can contribute to stone formation, calcium oxalate is the most common.  The pairs provided all incorrectly match substances with the primary constituent of kidney stones.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Location of Petroleum Resources          Geographical Feature
1. Kenai Peninsula                         :   Continental shelves
2. Sedimentary rocks                       :   Rogue waves
3.  Continental shelves                     :   Kenai Peninsula

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Petroleum resources are often found in sedimentary rocks, particularly those located on continental shelves. The Kenai Peninsula in Alaska is known for its petroleum resources, and these resources are found within the sedimentary rocks situated on the continental shelf.  Rogue waves are large and unpredictable ocean waves unrelated to petroleum resource location. Therefore, only the pairings connecting Kenai Peninsula to continental shelves and continental shelves to the Kenai Peninsula are accurate.  Option (b) incorrectly pairs sedimentary rocks with rogue waves.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biofuel Production Method            Energy Source
1. Cracking                               :   Biofuels
2. Hydrogenation                          :   Biofuels
3. Smelting                               :   Biofuels

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Cracking and hydrogenation are both processes that can be used in the production of biofuels, although they are also used in the refinement of petroleum. Smelting, however, is a metallurgical process used to extract metals from their ores and is not directly related to biofuel production.  Therefore, only cracking and hydrogenation are correctly paired with biofuels as production methods. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits hydrogenation, option (c) is incorrect because it includes smelting, and option (d) is incorrect because it includes smelting.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Drug/Substance                         Legal Action/Regulation
1. Oxytocin                               :   Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940
2.  Chloropicrin                          :   Delhi High Court
3.  Nitroplast                             :   Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The misuse of oxytocin is regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940.  The Delhi High Court has been involved in various legal cases related to the misuse of various drugs and chemicals, but it is not the primary legal framework governing oxytocin. Chloropicrin and Nitroplast are not directly addressed by the Delhi High Court, but their use and regulation could fall under various other laws.  Therefore, only the pairing of oxytocin with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 is directly and specifically supported by the provided information.  The other options contain incorrect or less precise pairings.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                 Production Method
1. Ammonia                           Haber-Bosch process
2. Ammonia                           Coal gasification
3. Chlorofluorocarbons              Electrochemical process
4. Chlorofluorocarbons              Ozone depletion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Haber-Bosch process is the primary industrial method for producing ammonia, involving the direct reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen under high pressure and temperature.  This makes pair 1 correct. Coal gasification, a process of converting coal into syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen), can also be used to produce ammonia as hydrogen is a key reactant in the ammonia synthesis. Therefore, pair 2 is also correct.  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are not produced through an electrochemical process; they are synthesized through chemical reactions.  Ozone depletion is a consequence of CFC release, not a production method. Thus, pairs 3 and 4 are incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                             Property/Use
1. Tungsten                             High ductility, used in filaments
2. Tungsten                             Ore: Wolframite
3. Carborundum                         Extremely hard
4. Nichrome                             Alloy of nickel and chromium


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Tungsten is known for its high melting point and ductility, making it suitable for use in incandescent light bulb filaments.  Wolframite and scheelite are important ores of tungsten. Carborundum (silicon carbide) is renowned for its exceptional hardness. Nichrome is indeed an alloy of nickel and chromium, commonly used in heating elements due to its high resistance. Therefore, all three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                         Application
1. Microwaves                         TV remote control
2. Radio waves                         TV remote control
3. Choke coil                          Increases current in a circuit
4. Choke coil                          Reduces high-frequency current


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

TV remote controls utilize infrared light waves, not microwaves or radio waves.  Choke coils in fluorescent tubes are used to limit the current surge when the tube is initially switched on and to suppress high frequency current, thus reducing current in the circuit.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrect because TV remotes use infrared, not radio waves. Pair 3 is incorrect because a choke coil reduces, not increases, current.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Refrigerant                          Use/Property
1. Ammonia                            Liquefies at low pressure
2. Ammonia                            Used in large cold storage plants
3. Chlorofluorocarbons              Used in domestic refrigerators
4. Chlorofluorocarbons              Causes global warming


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ammonia can be liquefied at ambient temperatures under relatively low pressures, making it an efficient refrigerant.  Large cold storage plants often use ammonia as a refrigerant due to its thermodynamic properties. Domestic refrigerators commonly use chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or other refrigerants.  While CFCs contribute to ozone depletion, they also contribute to global warming.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Phenomenon                        Observation/Application
1. Total Internal Reflection       Glass beads on traffic signals glowing
2. Diffraction                        Rainbow-like colours on CDs
3. Refraction                         Rainbow-like colours on CDs
4. Reflection                         Rainbow-like colours on CDs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The bright glow of glass beads on traffic signals is due to total internal reflection of light. The rainbow-like colours observed on CDs are a result of interference caused by diffraction and refraction of light from the microscopic grooves on the disc's surface. Reflection also plays a role in the overall appearance. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                           Function/Application
1. Laser beam                           Used in CD players
2. Quartz crystal                       Used in CD players
3. 24 frames per second in movies    Persistence of vision
4. 0.1s persistence of vision on retina  24 frames per second in movies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CD players use laser beams to read the data encoded on the disc. The projection of 24 frames per second in motion pictures exploits the persistence of vision, the phenomenon where the image formed on the retina persists for a short time after the stimulus is removed, creating the illusion of continuous motion.  The persistence of vision on the retina for about 0.1 seconds directly relates to why 24 frames per second is sufficient for smooth movie playback.  Quartz crystals are not directly involved in CD playback; they are used in some other applications. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element          Associated Industrial Process
1. Nickel                     :   Steel production
2. Sodium                    :   Chlor-alkali process
3. Chlorine                   :   Petroleum refining
4. Tin                        :   Solder manufacturing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nickel is a crucial alloying element in stainless steel and other high-strength steels.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The chlor-alkali process is an industrial method for producing chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) by the electrolysis of brine (sodium chloride solution). Pair 2 is correctly matched.  Chlorine is used in various industrial processes, but petroleum refining is not a primary application; it's more associated with the production of certain chemicals.  Thus, pair 3 is incorrect.  While tin is a component of solder, the primary manufacturing process of solder involves melting and alloying, not a specific process uniquely named "solder manufacturing." Pair 4 is therefore not strictly correctly matched. Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Property
1.  Diamond                   : High refractive index
2.  Water                      : High specific heat capacity
3.  Sulphuric acid             : High boiling point
4.  Lead                       : High density


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Diamond possesses an exceptionally high refractive index, making it sparkle brilliantly. Water's high specific heat capacity allows it to absorb significant heat with a relatively small temperature change.  Sulphuric acid has a notably high boiling point compared to many other acids. Lead is a dense metal, known for its high density. All four pairs accurately match the material with one of its key properties.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mineral                       Location of Significant Reserves
1. Nickel                      :  Australia
2. Copper                      :  Atacama Desert
3. Tin                         :  Bolivia
4. Molybdenum                 :  Colorado


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Australia is a major producer of nickel. The Atacama Desert in Chile is renowned for its vast copper deposits. Molybdenum is found in significant quantities in Colorado.  While tin is found in various locations globally, Bolivia is not a primary source compared to others like Indonesia or Malaysia.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is correct.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound         Application
1.  Formic acid                 : Ant venom
2.  Ethylene                   : Fruit ripening
3.  Methanol                   : Hand sanitizer ingredient (incorrect)
4.  Hydrofluoric acid           : Glass etching


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Formic acid is the primary component of ant venom. Ethylene is a plant hormone used to artificially ripen fruits. Hydrofluoric acid is used in etching glass due to its ability to react with silicon dioxide.  Methanol is toxic and should not be used in hand sanitizers; it was a dangerous component in some recalled products. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                 Characteristic
1. Lead-acid battery            : High number of charge-discharge cycles

**Explanation:**

Milk is a rich source of calcium, protein, and potassium, but it is not a significant source of Vitamin C. Mushrooms are a good source of protein and various B vitamins but are not particularly high in iron.  Fortified rice aims to increase the content of specific micronutrients like iron and Vitamin B1, but it's not a primary source of Vitamin B12. While eggs are a good source of protein and many nutrients, they are not a significant dietary source of molybdenum. All the pairs provided present incorrect or incomplete information regarding the specified nutritional components. The distractors are chosen to be plausible, as many people might incorrectly associate milk with Vitamin C, mushrooms with iron, and so on.


**3. With reference to the elements crucial for living organisms, consider the following pairs:**

   Element                                    Found Primarily In
1. Potassium                                   :   Hemoglobin
2. Sodium                                     :   Bones and teeth
3. Magnesium                                  :   Chlorophyll
4. Calcium                                    :   Cell membranes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Potassium is a vital electrolyte crucial for nerve function and muscle contraction, not a component of hemoglobin (which contains iron). Sodium plays a key role in fluid balance and nerve transmission,  not primarily found in bones and teeth (which are rich in calcium). Magnesium is a crucial component of chlorophyll, essential for photosynthesis in plants. Calcium is essential for bone structure, muscle contraction, and nerve transmission, but its presence in cell membranes is a minor aspect compared to its role in bone and teeth.  Only pair 3 correctly matches the element with its primary location or function. The incorrect pairs utilize plausible distractors, leveraging the general knowledge of these elements' roles in the body to create confusion.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Alcohol Type                                   Associated Health Risk
1. Ethyl Alcohol                               :   Blindness
2. Amyl Alcohol                               :   Nausea
3. Methyl Alcohol                              :   Central Nervous System Damage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ethyl alcohol, while associated with various health problems when consumed excessively, is not directly linked to blindness. Amyl alcohol, a component of some alcoholic beverages, can cause nausea and other gastrointestinal issues. Methyl alcohol (methanol) is extremely toxic and can lead to blindness, nausea, coma, seizures, and permanent damage to the central nervous system, even death.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 correctly link the alcohol type with the specified health risk. The distractor in option 1 attempts to mislead by associating ethyl alcohol with a serious outcome, playing on general awareness of alcohol's negative effects.


**5. With reference to the components of milk, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                  Found in Milk
1. Potassium                                 :   Present in negligible amounts
2. Iron                                       :   Absent in significant quantities
3. Calcium                                    :   Major mineral component
4. Vitamin C                                  :   Present only in trace amounts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Milk contains potassium, but in relatively small quantities compared to other minerals. While milk does contain some iron, it is not a significant dietary source. Milk is exceptionally rich in calcium, making it a crucial dietary source. Milk contains minimal amounts of Vitamin C. Hence, only pairs 3 and 4 provide accurate information about the presence and levels of the specified components in milk. The distractors use elements known to be present in milk but manipulate their quantities to create uncertainty.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                      Chemical Element Primarily Associated
1. Limestone                                  :   Iron
2. Fly Ash                                    :   Magnesium
3. Coal                                       :   Sodium
4. Polymetallic nodules                       :   Potassium


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Limestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate, not iron. Fly ash does contain magnesium, but it is not the primary element associated with it. Coal contains varying amounts of various elements, but sodium is not the primary element. Polymetallic nodules contain significant quantities of manganese, nickel, cobalt, and copper, not potassium.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched, as coal does contain sodium as a constituent element. The distractors are selected to be closely related elements commonly found in these materials, making it challenging to easily eliminate the incorrect pairs.


**7. With reference to the applications of copper, consider the following pairs:**

    Application                                  Historical Context/Use
1. Religious Rituals                           :   Ancient Egypt
2. Coinage                                    :   Maurya Empire
3.  Electrical Wiring                          :   Industrial Revolution
4.  Bronze Production                          :   Prehistoric era


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Copper has been used in religious rituals across numerous ancient civilizations, including Ancient Egypt. The Maurya Empire extensively used copper in coinage. The widespread use of copper in electrical wiring became prominent during the Industrial Revolution.  Bronze, an alloy primarily of copper and tin, was a significant material in the prehistoric era. All four pairs correctly link applications of copper to their relevant historical contexts.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Subatomic Particle                            Property/Characteristic
1. Proton                                      :   Negatively charged
2. Neutron                                     :   Zero charge
3. Electron                                    :   Located in the nucleus
4. Alpha particle                              :   Equivalent to a helium nucleus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Protons are positively charged, not negatively. Neutrons carry no electric charge. Electrons orbit the nucleus, not located within it. An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, effectively the nucleus of a helium atom.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The distractors involve fundamental properties of subatomic particles, making the incorrect options plausible.


**9.  With reference to DNA, consider the following pairs:**

    Component/Process                         Related to DNA
1.  Histones                                  :   RNA transcription
2.  Nucleotides                               :   Building blocks of DNA
3.  Cas9 enzyme                               :   DNA repair mechanism
4.  Guide RNA (gRNA)                         :   Genome editing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Histones are proteins that organize and compact DNA, not directly involved in RNA transcription (though they influence it). Nucleotides are the fundamental building blocks of DNA. The Cas9 enzyme is a crucial component in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, not primarily involved in DNA repair mechanisms (though it can be used for that). Guide RNA (gRNA) is essential for directing the Cas9 enzyme to the target DNA sequence in genome editing. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The distractors are chosen from closely related concepts in molecular biology.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Technology/Process                           Application in Industry
1.  3D Printing                               :   Microchip manufacturing

**Explanation:**

3D printing is used in various industries, including microchip manufacturing for creating intricate components. RPA is increasingly used in various sectors, including finance and customer service, but its application in precision agriculture is still developing. Tissue culture is extensively used in pharmaceutical production for creating large quantities of plant-based medicines and other bioproducts. Genome editing technology is revolutionizing agriculture by allowing the development of crops with enhanced traits such as disease resistance. Pairs 1, 3, and 4 present accurate applications of these technologies.  The distractor in pair 2 attempts to link RPA to a sector where its application is still emerging.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Hormone                 Associated Gland
1.  Thyroxine               :   Adrenal Gland
2.  Insulin                  :   Pancreas
3.  Testosterone            :   Testes
4.  Adrenaline              :   Pituitary Gland

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Insulin is secreted by the pancreas, and Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone produced by the testes.  Thyroxine is produced by the thyroid gland, not the adrenal gland. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is primarily produced by the adrenal medulla, not the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland does regulate the release of hormones from other glands, but it doesn't produce adrenaline itself. Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly include glands that do not produce the listed hormones or misattribute hormone production to the wrong endocrine organ.  Understanding the specific functions and locations of endocrine glands is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnological Product         Application
1. Recombinant proteins           :   Production of GMO crops
2.  GLP-1                        :   Glucose homeostasis regulation
3.  Insulin (GMO derived)        :   Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because GLP-1 increases insulin production and plays a role in glucose homeostasis, and GMO-derived insulin is used to treat diabetes.  Recombinant proteins are not directly used in the production of GMO crops, although genetic engineering techniques involving recombinant DNA are used to create GMOs. The production of GMO crops involves modifying a plant's genes to express a desired trait, often through the introduction of a foreign gene. While recombinant proteins are produced using genetic engineering techniques, their application is broader than just GMO crop production.  They have various uses in medicine, research, and industry. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 show a correct application for the given biotechnological products.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Isotope               Nuclear Application
1. Pu-239                 :   Fuel in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
2.  U-235                 :   Used in SNAP-10A satellite technology
3.  Ca-41                  :   Radiometric dating


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Calcium-41 is indeed used in radiometric dating, a technique to determine the age of materials. Plutonium-239 is a fissile material used in nuclear weapons and some reactors, but its primary use is not specifically in SMRs.  While SMRs use nuclear fission, the fuel type can vary.  The SNAP-10A satellite used a reactor based on nuclear fission, but not specifically U-235 as its sole fuel.  Different isotopes can be used in various nuclear reactor designs.  Understanding the different applications of these isotopes in nuclear technology is vital to correctly answer this question.  The distractors play on the general association of these isotopes with nuclear processes, but do not accurately reflect their specific applications.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Process/Technology       Location/Application
1. Nuclear fission                  :   Solar corona
2.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) :   Based on nuclear fusion
3.  Nuclear Reactor                 :   Formation of Pu-239


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because nuclear reactors are indeed where Plutonium-239 is formed through neutron capture and subsequent beta decay of uranium isotopes within the reactor core. Nuclear fission does not occur in the solar corona; the Sun's energy is primarily generated by nuclear fusion. Small Modular Reactors are based on nuclear fission, not fusion.  Fusion is a different type of nuclear reaction that combines light atomic nuclei to release energy. The other options include incorrect pairings based on a misunderstanding or misapplication of the core principles of nuclear physics and reactor technology.  A clear understanding of the differences between fission and fusion is key to answering this question accurately.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Material                       Property
1. Graphene                      :   Low thermal conductivity
2. Tantalum                       :   High corrosion resistance
3. White Phosphorus              :   Used in solar cells


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Tantalum is known for its exceptional corrosion resistance, a key property that makes it suitable for various applications where chemical inertness is critical. Graphene, on the other hand, possesses exceptionally high thermal conductivity—a property directly opposite to what is stated in the pair.  White phosphorus is not used in solar cells; its primary use is as an incendiary agent and in other applications unrelated to solar energy technologies. The distractors leverage common knowledge about materials science but deliberately present incorrect properties or applications to test the examinee's detailed understanding of material characteristics.  Precision in recalling the properties of these materials is crucial for answering this question correctly.

While pituitary hormones influence metabolism indirectly, their primary role isn't direct blood sugar regulation.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon, are the key regulators of blood glucose homeostasis, making statement 2 correct. The liver's significant role in glucose uptake and storage is well-established, making statement 3 correct. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the endocrine system's role in maintaining metabolic balance and differentiates between direct and indirect effects.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Blood Group of Father  Blood Group of Mother   Possible Blood Group of Son
1. A                       O                         A
2. A                       B                         AB
3. O                       O                         O


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

If the father's blood group is A and the mother's is O, the son can have either A or O blood group.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect as it shows only one possibility. If the father's blood group is A and the mother's is B, the son can have A, B, AB, or O blood groups. Pair 2 is partially correct as AB is a possibility, but not the only possibility. If both parents have O blood group, the son must also have O blood group.  Pair 3 is correct. The question tests the candidate's understanding of Mendelian inheritance and the complexities of blood group genetics.  The plausible distractor lies in the partial correctness of pair 2, requiring careful analysis.


**6.  With reference to breast-fed versus bottle-fed babies, consider the following statements:**

1. Breast-fed babies are less prone to obesity.

(b) 1, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Natural gas is primarily composed of methane.  Landfills are significant sources of methane due to anaerobic decomposition of organic waste.  Coalbed methane is primarily methane, not ethane. Biogas is a mixture of gases, predominantly methane but also containing carbon dioxide and other trace gases. Wetlands are a natural source of methane produced by methanogenic archaea, not carbon monoxide. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options include incorrect pairings based on the primary components or significant sources of methane.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                     Use/Property
1. Silver iodide                           Used in cloud seeding for artificial rain
2. Carbon dioxide                         Used in baking soda
3.  Ethylene                               Used in artificial ripening of fruits
4.  Sodium bicarbonate                    Component of baking powder

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Silver iodide is indeed used as a cloud seeding agent to induce artificial rain.  This process involves dispersing silver iodide crystals into clouds, providing nuclei for water droplets to condense around, thus increasing precipitation.  Ethylene is a plant hormone naturally produced by ripening fruits and is also used commercially to accelerate the ripening process.  The use of ethylene gas in controlled environments is a common practice in the agricultural industry.  Option (a) is incomplete because it doesn't include ethylene. Option (c) is incorrect as carbon dioxide is not a direct component of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), although it is involved in the reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas which causes the leavening effect in baking. Sodium bicarbonate is itself a component of baking powder, but baking powder also contains other ingredients such as an acid. Option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatching of carbon dioxide and baking soda. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Substance                                  Characteristic/Use

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Camphor is known for its ability to undergo sublimation, transitioning directly from a solid to a gaseous state without passing through a liquid phase.  Dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide, also exhibits sublimation. Teflon is a synthetic fluoropolymer, meaning it's a polymer containing fluorine atoms.  Naphthalene does exhibit volatility, it readily sublimes, but  the description "high volatility" is subjective and could apply to other substances as well, making it a less precise match compared to the clear-cut properties of sublimation and fluorine content.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 represent accurate matches based on well-established chemical properties.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

4.  Kevlar                                  Aramid

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Diamond, graphite, and fullerene are all allotropes of carbon, meaning they are different structural forms of the same element. They vary in their arrangement of carbon atoms, leading to different physical and chemical properties. Kevlar, however, is a synthetic polymer made from para-aramid. While carbon atoms are present within the aramid structure, the primary constituent is the para-aramid molecule itself, not just carbon.  Therefore, only the first three pairs accurately reflect the primary constituent element.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Process                                    Primary Energy Source
1. Photosynthesis                           Sunlight
2.  Nuclear Fission                          Uranium
3.  Geothermal Energy                      Earth's internal heat
4.  Hydroelectric Power Generation          Kinetic energy of moving water

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Nuclear fission is a process that releases energy from the nucleus of an atom, primarily using uranium or plutonium as fuel. Geothermal energy harnesses the heat from the Earth's interior, and hydroelectric power generation utilizes the kinetic energy of flowing water to produce electricity.  All four pairs correctly match the process with its primary energy source.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Heat Transfer Method                     Primary Mechanism
1. Conduction                             Direct molecular contact
2. Convection                             Fluid movement
3. Radiation                               Electromagnetic waves
4. Sublimation                             Phase transition

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Conduction involves the transfer of heat through direct contact between molecules. Convection relies on the movement of fluids (liquids or gases) to distribute heat. Radiation transfers energy through electromagnetic waves. Sublimation is a phase transition, not a method of heat transfer, although heat is involved in the process.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the primary mechanisms of heat transfer.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Semiconductor Manufacturing Stage           Description
1. Wafer Production                          :   Involves etching using gases or chemical baths.
2. Photolithography                          :   Circuit design is transferred onto a light-sensitive material using a mask and light exposure.
3. Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging :   Silicon die is connected to a PCB; chips are tested for functionality and reliability.
4. Ingot Creation                            :   Melted silicon is drawn into a rod.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the stages of semiconductor manufacturing. Photolithography involves using a mask and light exposure to transfer a circuit design onto a light-sensitive material, which is then etched to create the desired pattern.  Assembly, testing, marking, and packaging are crucial final steps that ensure the chip's functionality and reliability. The process involves connecting the silicon die to a printed circuit board (PCB), rigorous testing, marking for identification, and finally, packaging for protection and heat dissipation.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While etching is a part of wafer production, the description given is more accurately associated with the *etching* step within photolithography, not wafer production as a whole.  Wafer production encompasses many steps beyond etching. Pair 4 is also incorrect. The creation of an ingot from melted silicon is a step in wafer production, but it is not the complete description of the *wafer production* stage itself.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Semiconductor Type                     Example
1. Intrinsic Semiconductor                :   Aluminum (Al)
2. Extrinsic P-type Semiconductor        :   Arsenic (As)
3. Extrinsic N-type Semiconductor        :   Boron (B)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Intrinsic semiconductors are pure semiconductors like silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge) without any significant doping. Aluminum (Al), Arsenic (As), and Boron (B) are all dopants used to create extrinsic semiconductors.  Arsenic (As) and Phosphorus (P) are used for N-type doping, while Boron (B), Aluminum (Al), and Gallium (Ga) are used for P-type doping.  Therefore, all three pairs present incorrect pairings of semiconductor types and their examples.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Space Mission/Technology              Description
1. PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) :   Utilizes the spent third stage of the PSLV as an orbital platform.
2. CE-20 Cryogenic Engine                     :   Propellants are liquid oxygen and liquid methane.
3. Semi-Cryogenic Engine (SCE-200)           :   Developed with collaboration from Ukraine.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  POEM-2 correctly utilizes the spent *fourth* stage (PS4) of the PSLV, not the third.  The SCE-200's development did indeed involve collaboration with Ukraine, leveraging technology transfer agreements. However, the CE-20 cryogenic engine uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2), not liquid methane. Liquid methane is used in other rocket engines but not this one. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are partially correct, making (b) the most appropriate answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Solar Phenomenon                     Description
1. Solar Flare                           :   A continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun's corona.
2. Solar Wind                            :   Relatively intense, localized emission of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere.
3. Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)           : Always accompanies solar flares.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. A solar flare is indeed a relatively intense, localized emission of electromagnetic radiation.  Pair 1 incorrectly describes solar flares as a continuous stream of charged particles; that's the definition of solar wind.  Pair 3 is incorrect because while CMEs are often associated with solar flares, they do not *always* accompany them.  Therefore, only pair 2 accurately reflects the description of a solar phenomenon.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Material                    Application
1. Lab-Grown Diamonds                   :   Used in Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs).
2. Perovskite                             :   High efficiency solar cells.
3. Vanadium Flow Batteries (VFBs)         :   Renewable energy storage.
4. Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs)   :   Produce electricity from methanol.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2,3,4 and 1


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Perovskites are indeed used in high-efficiency solar cells due to their tunable properties. Vanadium flow batteries are a key technology for renewable energy storage, and DMFCs directly convert the chemical energy of methanol into electricity.  Pair 1 is incorrect; lab-grown diamonds do not have a direct application in DMFCs.  The correct applications of lab-grown diamonds are in jewelry and industrial applications.  Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   AI Concept/Technology                Description
1. Machine Learning                      :   Focuses on using data and algorithms to imitate human learning.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)    :   Enables machines to analyze and interpret visual information.
3. Computer Vision                        :   Powers virtual assistants and language translation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. Machine learning accurately focuses on using data and algorithms to mimic human learning processes.  Pair 2 incorrectly attributes the function of computer vision to NLP. NLP deals with text and speech, while computer vision handles visual data.  Pair 3 also incorrectly assigns the function of NLP to computer vision; computer vision deals with image analysis, not language processing. Therefore, only pair 1 is accurately matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                 Biological Process
1.  Methylcobalamin                   :   Red blood cell production
2.  Vitamin B12                       :   Neurological function
3.  Cobalamin                          :   DNA synthesis
4.  Adenosylcobalamin                 :   Fatty acid metabolism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Methylcobalamin, a form of vitamin B12, is crucial for red blood cell production.  A deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia.  Vitamin B12 plays a vital role in neurological function, maintaining the myelin sheath around nerve fibers.  Its deficiency can cause neurological symptoms like numbness, tingling, and cognitive impairment. Cobalamin, another name for Vitamin B12, is essential for DNA synthesis, as it is a coenzyme in several metabolic pathways.  The correct matching of these pairs reflects the multifaceted roles of vitamin B12 in various biological processes. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Option (a) incorrectly suggests only methylcobalamin's involvement in RBC production, ignoring B12's other crucial functions. Option (b) correctly identifies the roles of methylcobalamin and Vitamin B12 but omits the contribution of cobalamin to DNA synthesis. Option (c) incorrectly pairs only Vitamin B12 and Cobalamin with their respective functions and neglects Methylcobalamin.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                      Energy Form
1.  Wind Power                         :   Potential Energy
2.  Hypersonic Weapons                 :   Kinetic Energy
3.  Photosynthesis                     :   Chemical Energy
4.  Nuclear Fission                    :   Radiant Energy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Hypersonic weapons derive their destructive power from kinetic energy—the energy of motion. Their immense speed translates directly into significant kinetic energy upon impact. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored within the bonds of glucose molecules. This process is fundamental to plant life and the broader food chain. Wind power harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air to generate electricity. While wind possesses potential energy due to its height, the energy conversion in wind turbines primarily utilizes kinetic energy. Nuclear fission releases energy in the form of heat and radiation, not primarily as radiant energy. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either misidentify the energy form or include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                             Chemical Composition
1.  Bronze                               :   Copper and Silver
2.  Brass                                 :   Copper and Zinc
3.  Steel                                 :   Iron and Carbon
4.  Nylon                                :   Polyamide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Brass is an alloy primarily composed of copper and zinc. Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, with varying carbon content influencing its properties. Nylon is a synthetic polymer, chemically known as polyamide, characterized by its strength and elasticity. Bronze is an alloy primarily composed of copper and tin, not copper and silver.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the incorrectly matched pair 1.  Option (b) is partially correct but omits the correct matching of Nylon. Option (c) is partially correct but omits the correct matching of Brass.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Greenhouse Gas                      Environmental Impact
1.  Carbon Dioxide (CO2)              :   Ocean pH increase
2.  Methane (CH4)                     :   Global warming
3.  Nitrous Oxide (N2O)              :   Ozone layer depletion
4.  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)       :   Stratospheric ozone depletion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas contributing significantly to global warming. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are responsible for stratospheric ozone depletion, causing a reduction in the Earth's protective ozone layer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) causes a decrease in ocean pH (ocean acidification), not an increase. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is also a greenhouse gas, but its primary impact is not ozone depletion. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs, misrepresenting the environmental impacts of the listed greenhouse gases.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                  Property
1.  Silver                                 :   Low electrical conductivity
2.  Graphite                              :   High thermal conductivity
3.  Lead                                  :   High corrosion resistance
4.  Zinc                                  :   Poor malleability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 only


**Explanation:**

Graphite is known for its excellent thermal conductivity, making it suitable for applications requiring efficient heat transfer.  Silver is renowned for its exceptionally high electrical conductivity, making statement 1 incorrect. Lead has relatively poor corrosion resistance, particularly in acidic environments, contradicting statement 3. Zinc is known for its good malleability, meaning it can be easily shaped without breaking, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the materials' properties.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                           Application
1.  Li-Fi Technology                    :   Uses Semiconductors
2.  Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) :   Captures CO2
3.  3D Printing                         :   Additive Manufacturing
4.  MRI Technology                      :   Uses Ionizing Radiation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Li-Fi technology uses semiconductors for light-based data transmission. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology focuses on capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. 3D printing is synonymous with additive manufacturing, a process of building three-dimensional objects layer by layer. MRI technology uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves, not ionizing radiation.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 4, which wrongly attributes ionizing radiation to MRI.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                                  Causative Agent
1.  Meningitis                             :   Primarily Bacteria
2.  Tuberculosis (TB)                     :   Virus
3.  Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)           :   Influenza A virus
4.  Sickle Cell Disease                   :   Genetic Mutation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Meningitis is primarily caused by bacterial infections, although viral, fungal, and parasitic causes exist. Avian influenza is caused by influenza A viruses, specifically subtypes of the virus. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder stemming from a mutation in the gene responsible for hemoglobin production. Tuberculosis is caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, a bacterium. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is partially correct but incorrectly attributes a viral origin to Tuberculosis. Option (c) omits the correct matching of Meningitis. Option (a) only includes one correctly matched pair.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Use/Application
1.  Tantalum                    :   Substitute for Platinum
2.  Graphene                   :   Pencils
3.  White Phosphorus           :   Fertilizers
4.  Supercritical CO2           :   Enhanced Oil Recovery


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Tantalum's high melting point and corrosion resistance make it a potential substitute for platinum in certain applications. White phosphorus is used as a component in fertilizers, though its primary use is as an incendiary weapon. Supercritical carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery techniques.  Graphite, a form of carbon, is the primary component of pencil "lead," not graphene. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) omits the correct matching of white phosphorus and supercritical CO2. Option (b) omits supercritical CO2. Option (c) omits white phosphorus.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology            Description
1.  Radiometric Dating            :   Uses Calcium-41 exclusively
2.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA):   Method for radiometric dating
3.  Glycemic Index                 :   Measures blood sugar rise after food consumption
4.  Genome Editing                 :   Altering DNA of organisms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a technique used in radiometric dating, specifically for analyzing isotopes like Calcium-41. The Glycemic Index measures how quickly carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels. Genome editing involves manipulating an organism's DNA. Radiometric dating utilizes various radioactive isotopes, including but not limited to Calcium-41, and Carbon-14. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) incorrectly limits radiometric dating to Calcium-41. Option (b) excludes the correct pairing of genome editing. Option (c) excludes Atom-Trap Trace Analysis.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Metal                             Health Effect/Use
1.  Lead                               :   Essential for chlorophyll production
2.  Zinc                                :   Aids metabolism
3.  Tin                                 :   Used in preserved food packaging
4.  Silver                              :   Used in electroplating


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Zinc plays a vital role in various metabolic processes in living organisms. Tin is used extensively in food packaging to prevent corrosion. Silver is a widely used metal in electroplating, taking advantage of its electrical conductivity and resistance to tarnishing. Lead is a toxic heavy metal and is not essential for chlorophyll production; its presence is detrimental to human and environmental health. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) incorrectly attributes a beneficial role to lead. Option (b) omits the correct matching of silver. Option (d) includes the incorrect pairing of lead.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

     Celestial Body             Characteristic

1.  Pulsar                     :   Emits pulses of radiation at precise intervals
2.  Quasar                     :   Located near the Milky Way galaxy
3.  Blazar                      :   Powered by a supermassive black hole
4.  White Dwarf                :   Formed by the collapse of a massive star


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, observed as pulses from Earth at precise intervals.  This makes pair 1 correct. Blazars are active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes, making pair 3 correct.  Quasars, also active galactic nuclei, are *not* located near the Milky Way; they are extremely distant.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. While white dwarfs are formed from the remnants of stars, they are not formed by the collapse of *massive* stars; that process leads to neutron stars or black holes. White dwarfs are formed from low to medium-mass stars.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  Option (a) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**2. With reference to solar phenomena, consider the following pairs:**

     Solar Phenomenon           Description

1.  Solar Flare                 :   A large, bright feature extending outward from the Sun's surface
2.  Solar Prominence           :   Giant explosions on the Sun sending energy and particles into space
3.  Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) :   Significant ejection of magnetic field and plasma from the Sun's corona
4.  Picoflare Jet               :   High-speed charged particle emission from coronal holes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a significant release of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's corona, making pair 3 correct.  Picoflare jets are indeed high-speed emissions of charged particles originating from coronal holes, validating pair 4.  However, solar flares are giant explosions releasing energy and particles, not large features extending outward (that's a solar prominence). Thus, pair 1 is incorrect.  Solar prominences are large, bright features extending from the Sun's surface, not explosions; therefore, pair 2 is also incorrect. Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

      Telescope                       Location/Characteristic

1.  James Webb Space Telescope   :   Primarily observes in the visible light spectrum
2.  Himalayan Chandra Telescope :   Located at Devasthal Observatory, Uttarakhand
3.  Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope :   Largest radio telescope array at low frequencies
4.  International Liquid-Mirror Telescope: Uses a rotating mercury mirror


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) is indeed the largest radio telescope array sensitive to low frequencies, making pair 3 correct.  The International Liquid-Mirror Telescope (ILMT) utilizes a rotating liquid mercury mirror for its reflective surface, making pair 4 correct.  However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) primarily observes in the infrared, not the visible light spectrum; hence, pair 1 is incorrect.  The Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) is situated in Hanle, Ladakh, not Devasthal Observatory; thus, pair 2 is also incorrect.  Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Earth's gravitational field, consider the following pairs:**

     Location/Feature             Effect on Gravitational Force

1.  Equator                       :   Higher gravitational force
2.  Poles                         :   Lower gravitational force
3.  Equatorial Bulge              :   Affects the distribution of gravitational force
4.  Centrifugal Force             :   Counteracts gravitational force


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The equatorial bulge, caused by Earth's rotation, does affect the distribution of gravitational force across the planet's surface, making pair 3 correct. The centrifugal force generated by Earth's rotation does oppose gravity, particularly at the equator, making pair 4 correct.  However, the gravitational force is *lower* at the equator and *higher* at the poles due to the centrifugal force and the Earth's shape; pairs 1 and 2 are therefore incorrect. Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are indeed the most powerful explosions known in the universe, making pair 2 correct.  The other pairs are incorrect. FRBs are extremely brief, lasting milliseconds, not seconds. Zero Shadow Day occurs between the tropics, not only at the poles. Gravitational waves were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, not Newton's laws. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


These questions test factual recall, analysis, and the ability to identify correct pairings amidst plausible distractors, aligning with UPSC question styles and difficulty levels.  The explanations provide in-depth reasoning for the correct and incorrect options, enriching the learning experience.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                      Major Producing State
1.  Ginger                    Kerala
2.  Onion                     Maharashtra
3.  Potato                    Uttar Pradesh
4.  Coconut                  Karnataka
5.  Maize                     Bihar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While India is a significant producer of all these crops, the pairs given are not all correctly matched.  Option (c) is the only one that contains correctly matched pairs.  Maharashtra is indeed a leading producer of onions, and Uttar Pradesh is a major potato-producing state. Let's examine the incorrect pairs. Kerala is known for its coconut production, but also produces significant quantities of ginger. However,  West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh are also major ginger-producing states, making "Kerala" not the sole major producer. Similarly, Karnataka is a significant coconut producer, but Kerala holds the largest share of coconut production in India,  Bihar is a major producer of Maize but not the only or major one. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are definitively and solely correctly matched based on the major producing state.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of agricultural geography and their ability to identify the most accurate statement from a set of plausible but not entirely correct options.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commodity              Category
1. Onion                     Starch Crop

3. Coconut                   Endosperm
4. Tomato                    Fruit
5. Maize                     Cereal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of botanical classifications of agricultural commodities. Option (c) correctly identifies the categories of three commodities.  Coconut's edible part is indeed the endosperm, tomato is botanically a fruit, and maize is a cereal.  Let's examine why the other options are incorrect. Onion is not a starch crop; it's a bulb vegetable.  Potato is a stem tuber, not a root vegetable.  Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The question aims to test detailed knowledge and ability to distinguish between botanical and culinary classifications.

4. Onion                    Spice
5. Ginger                   Condiment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the primary uses of various crops. Option (b) contains three correctly matched pairs. Potatoes are a significant source of starch, coconuts are widely used for oil extraction, and maize is extensively used as animal feed.  Let's analyze the incorrect pairs. Onions are not primarily used as a spice; they are a vegetable.  While ginger is used as a condiment, its primary use is not limited to that; it has medicinal applications as well.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are definitively and primarily correct.  The question's difficulty stems from the nuanced nature of crop uses and the inclusion of plausible distractors.

2. Bituminous Coal                   : Moderate sulfur content
3. Subbituminous Coal                 : Lower heating value than bituminous coal
4. Lignite                             : Highest moisture content

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched based on the established characteristics of different coal types. Anthracite coal, a metamorphic rock, is known for its high carbon content, resulting in high energy density and a clean burn. Bituminous coal, a common type, typically contains a moderate amount of sulfur, which is an environmental concern due to its contribution to acid rain when burned. Subbituminous coal has a lower heating value compared to bituminous coal because of its lower carbon content and higher moisture content. Lastly, lignite, also known as brown coal, possesses the highest moisture content among the coal types, leading to lower energy density and a less efficient burn. These characteristics are well-established in geology and energy science, making all four pairs factual and accurate.  The options strategically include combinations to test the candidate's thorough understanding of the properties of various coal types.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                         Chemical Compound/Form
1. Dry Ice                           : Solid carbon dioxide (CO2)
2. Gasohol                           : Mixture of gasoline and ethanol
3. Benzene                           : Aromatic hydrocarbon, C6H6
4. Methane                           : Primary component of natural gas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Dry ice is indeed solid carbon dioxide, a well-known fact in chemistry. Gasohol is a fuel blend consisting of gasoline and ethanol, commonly used as an alternative fuel source. Methane is the primary component of natural gas, a crucial energy source globally. However, the pairing of benzene is incorrect.  While benzene *is* an aromatic hydrocarbon with the formula C6H6, the question asks for a specific chemical compound or form.  The description provided is not a precise chemical form in the same manner as the other pairs which offer specific chemical identities.  The correct answer necessitates a thorough understanding of the precise chemical compositions and forms of the listed materials, thereby testing the candidate's detailed knowledge.  The options are crafted to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between a general description and a precise chemical identification.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                     Type of Energy

2. Geothermal energy                : Renewable energy
3. Petroleum                          : Non-renewable fossil fuel
4. Natural Gas                       : Non-renewable fossil fuel
5. Biofuels                           : Renewable biomass energy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are all categorized as non-renewable fossil fuels due to their finite nature and long formation times.  Geothermal energy, harnessed from the Earth's internal heat, is renewable because the Earth's internal heat is continuously replenished.  Biofuels are derived from organic matter such as plants, and thus are considered renewable biomass energy. The options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the classification of different energy sources.  The inclusion of both renewable and non-renewable sources, and the use of specific terms like "fossil fuel" and "biomass energy," adds complexity and tests the candidate's precise knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                       Process
1. Dry ice                         : Sublimation

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Dry ice, solid carbon dioxide, undergoes sublimation—a transition directly from solid to gas—at standard atmospheric pressure.  Coal is commonly subjected to combustion to generate heat and energy.  Petroleum is refined through fractional distillation, a process that separates the various components based on their boiling points. Natural gas is often liquefied (liquefaction) for easier storage and transportation.  Each pair accurately reflects a common process associated with the material.  The options include combinations that might seem plausible to someone with incomplete knowledge of industrial processes, testing the candidate's detailed understanding of the processes involved in handling these materials.

Therefore, all four pairs correctly link a geographic location with a related resource.  The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of global resource distribution and industrial activities, incorporating both national and international contexts.  The inclusion of specific locations and the variation in the type of resource (reserves vs. production) increase the question's difficulty level.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Industry/Sector                  Resource Used
1. Power Sector                     : Coal
2. Petrochemical Industry           : Petroleum
3. Electric power generation       : Natural gas
4. Polluting industries              : Coal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The power sector heavily relies on coal for electricity generation. The petrochemical industry uses petroleum as a feedstock for producing various chemicals and plastics. Natural gas is also a significant fuel for electric power generation.  Many polluting industries use coal as a primary energy source, contributing to air and water pollution.  The inclusion of various industrial sectors and the use of a common resource type (fuels) adds to the question's difficulty.  The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of industrial resource consumption patterns and their environmental implications.

3. Hydrogen sulfide                    : Geothermal energy
4. Mercury                           : Fossil fuels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Burning coal releases oxides of sulfur, a major air pollutant.  Methane is the primary component of natural gas. Geothermal energy sources often contain hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas.  Fossil fuels, including coal and oil, can contain mercury as an impurity, which is released during combustion.  All pairs accurately link a chemical compound or element to its source or occurrence.  The options are deliberately structured to test the examinee's detailed knowledge of the chemical composition of various energy sources and their environmental effects.  The inclusion of both common and less-commonly discussed pollutants (like hydrogen sulfide) increases the difficulty level.

   Chemical Compound      Use/Application
1. Boric acid                  : Food preservative
2. Nitric oxide                 : Laughing gas
3. Methanol                    : Produced from natural gas
4. Ethanol                      : Component of Gasohol

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Boric acid has applications as a food preservative in certain contexts.  Methanol is produced from natural gas through various chemical processes. Ethanol is a key component of Gasohol, a fuel blend.

4. Peat                 : Precursor to coal, formed from partially decayed plant matter

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Anthracite coal is indeed the highest-rank coal, formed over long periods under significant pressure and temperature.  Bituminous coal formation was prevalent during the Carboniferous period, a key era for coal formation.  Lignite is the youngest coal type, characterized by its high moisture content. Peat is the initial stage in coal formation, resulting from the partial decomposition of plant matter.  While the descriptions might seem lengthy, they accurately reflect the geological processes and characteristics of different coal types. The options are designed to test the candidate’s detailed understanding of coal formation and its stages, integrating geological and energy concepts.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Chemical Compound                 Property/Use
    1. U-235                           :   Used in the manufacture of polyester fibers
    2. Ethylene glycol                 :   Isotope of Uranium
    3. Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) :   High concentration of U-235
    4. U-238                           :   Undergoes neutron irradiation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) is indeed characterized by its high concentration of the U-235 isotope.  Let's analyze the other pairs:

* **Pair 1:** U-235 is a fissile isotope used as fuel in nuclear reactors, not in the manufacture of polyester fibers. Ethylene glycol is the correct compound used in polyester fiber production.

* **Pair 2:** Ethylene glycol is an organic compound used as an antifreeze and in the production of polyester fibers. It is not an isotope of Uranium.  U-235 is an isotope of Uranium.

* **Pair 4:** While U-238 can undergo neutron irradiation (leading to the production of Plutonium in breeder reactors), this is not a defining or unique property of U-238.  Many isotopes can undergo this process.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Material/Compound              Process/Application

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Carbon dioxide is a significant component of biogas, a renewable energy source produced through anaerobic digestion.  Carbon monoxide, a toxic gas, readily oxidizes in the atmosphere to form carbon dioxide. Nitrogen is a crucial element for plant growth, forming a vital component of amino acids, proteins, and chlorophyll.  Water is an essential reactant in the process of photosynthesis, where it combines with carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. Sunlight provides the energy needed to drive the photosynthetic reaction, converting light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose.  Therefore, all the pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element/Compound            Role/Process

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nitrogen is a fundamental building block of amino acids, the monomers that make up proteins.  Carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas, contributing substantially to global warming through its heat-trapping properties.  Oxygen can react with nitrogen at high temperatures, though this reaction is not spontaneous under normal conditions.  Carbon monoxide indirectly contributes to increased methane levels in the atmosphere through complex chemical reactions. Water is a source material for hydrogen production through processes like electrolysis.  Therefore, all the pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                     Characteristic/Use
1. Ice                                        :   Lower friction than roads

5.  Liquid Nitrogen                           : Used in cryotherapy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ice has a lower coefficient of friction compared to roads, making it difficult to walk on. Oil, being less dense than water, floats on the water's surface. Sunlight is essential for the growth of corals through photosynthesis by symbiotic algae. A fuse wire is designed with high resistance and a low melting point; when the current exceeds a safe limit, the wire melts, breaking the circuit. Liquid Nitrogen's extremely low temperature makes it suitable for cryotherapy applications.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus, incorrect.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Process/Entity                 Associated Compound/Element

(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis utilizes carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen.  Anaerobic digestion, a process of decomposition in the absence of oxygen, produces carbon dioxide and methane as byproducts. Plant growth is dependent on nitrogen, a crucial component of proteins and nucleic acids. Denitrification, a microbial process, converts nitrates in the soil into gaseous nitrogen. The kidneys filter blood, removing waste products and maintaining electrolyte balance. Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Process                       Related Term/Substance

3. Desert Plants                          :   Have long root systems
4.  Eutrophication                        : Caused by excess Nitrogen
5.  Artificial Ripening of Fruits        : Uses Ethylene


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Global warming is directly linked to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, uses water as a reactant. Desert plants adapt to arid conditions by developing extensive root systems to access scarce water resources. Eutrophication, the excessive enrichment of water bodies with nutrients, is often caused by excess nitrogen runoff from fertilizers. Artificial ripening of fruits utilizes ethylene gas to accelerate the ripening process.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they don't fully reflect the correct matches.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

RNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing RNA molecules during transcription, a process primarily occurring within the cell nucleus.  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located within the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell where cellular respiration, the process of energy production, takes place.  The mtDNA encodes genes essential for mitochondrial function. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) resides within chloroplasts, the organelles responsible for photosynthesis in plant cells.  cpDNA carries genes crucial for the photosynthetic process. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, reflecting the fundamental roles and locations of these molecules within the cellular context.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

2.  RNA                             :   Transcription Product of DNA
3.  Ribosomes                       :   Protein Synthesis
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

DNA serves as the template for RNA synthesis during transcription, not the translation of proteins.  Translation is the process where ribosomes use mRNA to synthesize proteins.  RNA is indeed the transcription product of DNA; this is a central tenet of the central dogma of molecular biology. Ribosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, using the information encoded in mRNA.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect because it attributes protein translation to DNA, which is actually the function of ribosomes using the information from mRNA. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude the correctly matched pairs 2 and 3.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Process               Location/Organism
1.  Photosynthesis                 :   Mitochondria
2.  Cellular Respiration           :   Chloroplasts
3.  Gene Expression                :   Ribosomes
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, not mitochondria. Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration.  Cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria, not chloroplasts.  Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis. Gene expression, encompassing transcription and translation, does involve ribosomes for protein synthesis, but the entire process is not solely confined to ribosomes; it includes the nucleus for transcription and the cytoplasm for translation. All three pairs are incorrectly matched, reflecting a misunderstanding of the locations of these key biological processes. Therefore, the correct answer is (a).


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Characteristic/Concern

(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 2 and 3 only.  Eubacteria are indeed classified under the Kingdom Monera, a kingdom encompassing prokaryotic organisms.  Yeast, a single-celled fungus used in bread-making, belongs to the Kingdom Fungi.  However, Archaebacteria are not classified under Protista. Archaebacteria are a distinct domain of life, separate from Bacteria and Eukarya (which includes Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia).  They are single-celled prokaryotes, but their genetic makeup and cellular structures differ significantly from Eubacteria, placing them in their own distinct domain.  This highlights the importance of understanding the three-domain system of classification in biology, which recognizes the fundamental differences between Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.  Option (a) is incorrect because it misclassifies Archaebacteria. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct classification of Yeast. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect classification of Archaebacteria.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only.  Psilocybin, a psychoactive compound, is produced by certain species of fungi. This is a well-established fact in mycology and pharmacology. The other pairs are incorrect. Penicillin, a crucial antibiotic, is produced by the fungus *Penicillium*, not by *Bacillus thuringiensis*, which produces insecticidal proteins.  Insecticidal proteins are not typically associated with yeast; various bacteria, such as *Bacillus thuringiensis*, are the primary producers of such proteins. This question tests knowledge of specific products and their biological sources. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one mismatched pair.  The question highlights the diverse range of products derived from various organisms.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Sulphuric acid, a strong acid, significantly contributes to water contamination when released into water bodies. It lowers the pH, harming aquatic life and making the water unsuitable for drinking or other uses.  Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major contributors to acid rain.  They react with water vapor in the atmosphere to form nitric acid, which falls to earth as acid rain. Methane gas (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas, contributing significantly to global warming and climate change.  Its ability to trap heat in the atmosphere is far greater than that of carbon dioxide.  Therefore, all three pairs accurately reflect the environmental impacts of these substances. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.

2. Adaptive (Acquired) Immunity         :   First line of defense against pathogens, present from birth
3. Passive Immunity                        :   Immunity acquired through transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 accurately describes passive immunity.  Passive immunity involves the transfer of pre-formed antibodies or activated T-cells from an immune host, providing immediate but temporary protection. Pair 1 incorrectly attributes the description of adaptive immunity to innate immunity. Innate immunity is the immediate, non-specific response to pathogens, while adaptive immunity is slower, specific, and develops after exposure. Pair 2 incorrectly associates the description of innate immunity with adaptive immunity.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the fundamental differences between the various types of immune responses. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include pairs that misrepresent the characteristics of innate, adaptive, and passive immunity.  A clear understanding of immunology is necessary to correctly identify the accurate pair.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune Cell Type                      Function

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 accurately describes a key aspect of Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT). MRT fundamentally involves replacing faulty mitochondria. Pair 1 incorrectly describes MST; MST involves transferring the *mother's* nucleus, not pronuclei from both eggs. Pair 2 is partially correct in that PNT uses pronuclei, but incorrectly assigns this description to only PNT, when both techniques are involved in MRT. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the procedures involved in MRT, specifically the distinction between MST and PNT. Options (a), (b), and (d) demonstrate a lack of understanding of the technical details of these advanced reproductive technologies, highlighting the need for precise knowledge in this field.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 accurately describes a key characteristic of viral vector vaccines.  A major concern with DNA vaccines is the potential for the DNA to integrate into the host genome, which could have unforeseen consequences. Pair 1 incorrectly assigns a characteristic of traditional vaccines (proven efficacy and safety over many years) to mRNA vaccines, which are newer. Pair 2 incorrectly states that high efficacy is a characteristic of DNA vaccines and attributes a characteristic of mRNA vaccines to DNA vaccines.  The question tests understanding of the relative advantages and disadvantages of different vaccine types. Options (a), (b), and (d) reveal a lack of understanding of the nuances of various vaccine technologies and their associated safety profiles.  This requires specialized knowledge in vaccinology and the latest advancements in the field.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 accurately defines antigenic drift. Antigenic drift refers to the minor mutations in influenza viruses that lead to changes in surface proteins. Pair 1 incorrectly defines herd immunity as immunosuppression; herd immunity is a population-level phenomenon where sufficient immunity prevents widespread disease transmission. Pair 2 incorrectly defines immunosuppression as herd immunity; immunosuppression is a deliberate or unintentional weakening of the immune system. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of key terminology in immunology and epidemiology.  Options (a), (b), and (d) demonstrate a misunderstanding of fundamental immunological concepts, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of terminology and their applications.  This question requires a high degree of precision in understanding the definitions and applications of these terms.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). Increased efficacy and decreased shelf life are indeed features of fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs.  Increased efficacy is often a benefit, and decreased shelf life is a potential drawback. However, reduced cost is not necessarily a direct consequence of the combination itself, but rather a potential benefit of combined production and distribution. Pharmacodynamic mismatch, while a risk, is not a direct feature of *all* FDCs, but a potential problem in some formulations. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of FDCs. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrect pairings or fail to accurately represent the relationship between the listed features and FDC drugs.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Graphite is renowned for its excellent thermal conductivity, making it suitable for applications requiring efficient heat dissipation. Diamond possesses a high refractive index, responsible for its brilliance and sparkle. Graphene, due to its single-layer structure, exhibits a remarkably high surface area, useful in various applications. Anthracite coal, being a high-rank coal, contains a significantly high percentage of carbon. Fullerene, while a carbon allotrope, is not a good conductor of electricity in its standard form; however, some derivatives can exhibit conductivity depending on their structure and doping. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (c) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include pair 5 or exclude correctly matched pairs. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between properties of various carbon allotropes.

1. Diamond                    Pencil lead
2. Graphite                   Jewelry
3. Graphene                   Lithium-ion batteries
4. Fullerene                   Heat spreader in electronics
5. Anthracite coal             Fuel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1,2,3,4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphite, not diamond, is the primary component of pencil lead.  Diamonds are valued for their use in jewelry due to their exceptional hardness and brilliance. Graphene's unique properties make it a crucial component in advanced lithium-ion batteries. Fullerenes are not typically used as heat spreaders; that is more commonly a role for diamond.  Anthracite coal is indeed a fuel source.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  The distractors play on the common knowledge of the uses of diamonds and graphite and the less-known properties of graphene and fullerenes. The question assesses factual recall and application of knowledge about different carbon allotropes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element       Abundance Location
1. Sodium                  Earth's crust
2. Carbon                  Organic substances
3. Nitrogen                 Fertilizers
4. Vanadium                Titanomagnetite
5. Tantalum                 Sutlej River sand


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Sodium is indeed an abundant element in the Earth's crust. Carbon is a fundamental constituent of organic substances. Nitrogen is a key component of fertilizers, but not the only location of its abundance. Vanadium is found in titanomagnetite ore. Recent research has confirmed the presence of tantalum in the Sutlej River sand.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (c) accurately reflects this. The inclusion of nitrogen in fertilizers as a distractor tests the understanding of the element's various roles. The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify the correct pairings of elements and their locations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                   Formation Process
1. Graphite                   Metamorphism
2. Diamond                   High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT)
3. Graphene                  Exfoliation of graphite
4. Lab-grown diamond        Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
5. Anthracite coal            Sedimentation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphite formation is linked to the metamorphic processes that occur within the Earth's crust. Diamonds are formed under high pressure and temperature conditions. Graphene can be obtained through the exfoliation of graphite. Lab-grown diamonds can be produced through CVD method.  Anthracite coal forms through the accumulation and compression of organic matter over geological time, a process not strictly limited to sedimentation alone; however, sedimentation is a significant factor. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer. Option (d) incorrectly includes pair 5, while others incorrectly exclude correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the understanding of the formation processes of different materials, testing conceptual understanding and factual recall.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geological Feature      Element/Material Released
1. Permafrost             Carbon
2. Red Mud                 Rare Earth Elements (REEs)
3. Titanomagnetite         Vanadium
4. Gulf of Khambhat        Tantalum
5. Bauxite                 Aluminum


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Thawing permafrost releases significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Red mud, a byproduct of aluminum production, contains REEs. Titanomagnetite is a primary source of vanadium.  Aluminum is extracted from bauxite.  The inclusion of the Gulf of Khambhat as a source of tantalum is incorrect based on available information.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched, making option (c) correct. The distractor with the Gulf of Khambhat tests the knowledge of recent discoveries and their geographical context, demanding precise factual recall.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to link geological features with the elements or materials they contain.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by the correct answer, a detailed explanation, and an analysis of distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element         Associated Property/Use in Fertilizers
1. Nitrogen (N)              :   Component of urea
2. Phosphorus (P)           :   Essential for nodulation by Rhizobium
3. Potassium (K)            :   High proportion in MOP fertilizer
4. Iron (Fe)                 :   Contaminant of drinking water
5. Sulphur (S)               : Reacts with Iron to form brittle iron sulphide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched based on established scientific and agricultural knowledge.  Nitrogen is a crucial component of urea, a widely used nitrogenous fertilizer. Phosphorus plays a vital role in the nodulation process facilitated by Rhizobium bacteria, essential for nitrogen fixation in leguminous plants. Potassium is a major component of Muriate of Potash (MOP) fertilizer. Iron, while an essential micronutrient for plants, can contaminate drinking water sources due to fertilizer runoff and leaching.  Finally, Sulphur reacts with iron, leading to the formation of brittle iron sulphide, impacting the structural integrity of iron-based materials.  This reaction is relevant in the context of agricultural machinery and soil chemistry where iron and sulphur might interact.  The incorrect options fail to include all the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the environmental impact of fertilizers, consider the following pairs:**

   Fertilizer-Related Impact      Associated Environmental Issue
1. Nitrous oxide emissions       :   Groundwater contamination
2. Ammonia contamination        :   Soil health degradation
3. Leaching into water bodies    :   Eutrophication
4.  Urea application             :   Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly identifies two accurate pairings. Leaching of fertilizers into water bodies is a significant contributor to eutrophication, the excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants due to nutrient enrichment.  The application of urea, a nitrogen-rich fertilizer, is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.  Options (a), (b), and (d) contain mismatches. While ammonia from fertilizers can contaminate groundwater and contribute to soil degradation, the direct link presented in the options isn't the most accurate representation of the complex process.  Nitrous oxide emissions are not the primary cause of groundwater contamination; nitrates are more commonly implicated.


**3. With reference to the components and effects of fertilizers, consider the following pairs:**

   Nutrient in Fertilizers         Effect on Plants/Environment
1. Nitrogen (N)                  :   Essential for chlorophyll synthesis
2. Phosphorus (P)               :   Promotes root development
3. Potassium (K)                 :   Increases disease resistance
4. Iron (Fe)                      :  Contributes to overall plant growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate relationships between nutrients in fertilizers and their effects on plants and the environment. Nitrogen is a crucial component of chlorophyll, the green pigment essential for photosynthesis.  Phosphorus is vital for root development and overall plant health. Potassium enhances disease resistance and improves the plant's stress tolerance. Iron, a micronutrient, plays a vital role in various plant metabolic processes contributing to overall growth.  Therefore, all the given pairings are correct, making option (c) the only appropriate choice.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fertilizer Type           Primary Nutrient Source
1. DAP                           :   Phosphorus
2. MOP                           :   Potassium
3. Urea                          :   Nitrogen
4. Ammonium Nitrate            : Nitrogen


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four fertilizer types are correctly paired with their primary nutrient sources. DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) is a phosphorus-rich fertilizer. MOP (Muriate of Potash) is a potassium fertilizer. Urea is a nitrogenous fertilizer, and ammonium nitrate is another commonly used nitrogen fertilizer.  The incorrect options fail to include all the correctly matched pairs.  Therefore, only option (b) encompasses all the correct pairings.


**5.  With reference to government policies related to fertilizers, consider the following pairs:**

   Government Policy/Scheme      Related Fertilizer Aspect
1. NBS (Nutrient Based Subsidy) :   Subsidizes fertilizer production
2.  Import of Fertilizers        :   Reduces domestic fertilizer production
3.  Ethanol blending program    :  Reduces reliance on petroleum-based fertilizers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) scheme directly subsidizes the production and distribution of fertilizers based on their nutrient content, thus impacting production costs. The ethanol blending program indirectly reduces the reliance on petroleum-based products, including those used in fertilizer production, shifting towards agricultural by-products and promoting a more sustainable agricultural system. The import of fertilizers might influence domestic production but doesn't necessarily reduce it directly; it could even complement domestic production depending on the market dynamics.  Therefore, only options 1 and 3 are accurately matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Genetic Disorder                     Inheritance Pattern
    1. Haemophilia                         : Autosomal recessive inheritance
    2. Sickle Cell Anaemia                 : X-linked recessive inheritance
    3.  Huntington's Disease              : Autosomal dominant inheritance
    4.  Colour Blindness                   : X-linked recessive inheritance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning it's carried on the X chromosome and more common in males. Sickle cell anaemia is an autosomal recessive disorder, requiring two copies of the affected gene for manifestation. Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning only one copy of the affected gene is sufficient to cause the disease. Colour blindness is also an X-linked recessive disorder, predominantly affecting males.  Therefore, only the pairs describing Huntington's Disease and Colour Blindness are correctly matched with their respective inheritance patterns. The other options incorrectly pair disorders with their inheritance patterns. Option (a) is incorrect as Haemophilia is X-linked. Option (b) is incorrect because Sickle Cell Anaemia is autosomal recessive. Option (d) is incorrect because while Colour Blindness is X-linked recessive, Sickle Cell Anaemia is not X-linked.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Antibiotic                       Mechanism of Action
    1. Penicillin                      : Inhibits protein synthesis
    2. Tetracycline                    : Inhibits cell wall synthesis
    3. Streptomycin                   : Inhibits DNA replication
    4. Chloramphenicol                : Inhibits protein synthesis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Penicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, not protein synthesis. Tetracycline inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Streptomycin also inhibits protein synthesis, binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, not DNA replication. Chloramphenicol inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.  Therefore, only the pairs correctly matching Penicillin with cell wall synthesis inhibition and Chloramphenicol with protein synthesis inhibition are correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly pair antibiotics with their mechanisms of action, demonstrating a misunderstanding of antibiotic pharmacology.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Biological Structure          Function
    1. Phloem                          : Transports water and minerals
    2. Xylem                           : Transports photosynthetic products
    3.  Mitochondria                   : Cellular respiration
    4.  Golgi apparatus                : Protein modification and packaging

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Phloem is responsible for transporting sugars and other photosynthetic products, not water and minerals. Xylem transports water and minerals from roots to other parts of the plant. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for cellular respiration. The Golgi apparatus modifies and packages proteins, preparing them for secretion or transport within the cell. Thus, only the pairs involving mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus are correctly matched with their functions.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly assign functions to the biological structures, highlighting a lack of understanding of plant and cell biology.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Chromosome                     Characteristic
    1. X chromosome                 : Determines maleness
    2. Y chromosome                 : Contains SRY gene
    3.  Autosome                      :  Sex-linked traits
    4.  Y chromosome                 : Inherited from the mother

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The X chromosome is primarily associated with sex determination in females, not males; the Y chromosome carries the SRY gene that initiates male development. Autosomes are non-sex chromosomes;  sex-linked traits are carried on sex chromosomes (X or Y), not autosomes. The Y chromosome is inherited paternally (from the father), not maternally. Therefore, only the pair correctly matching the Y chromosome with its SRY gene is accurate. Other options show a fundamental misunderstanding of chromosomal inheritance and sex determination.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Radiation                 Wavelength
    1. Radio waves                     : Shortest wavelength
    2. Ultraviolet radiation           : Longer wavelength than X-rays
    3. X-rays                           : Shorter wavelength than visible light
    4. Infrared radiation              : Longer wavelength than visible light


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Radio waves have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation has a shorter wavelength than infrared radiation but longer than X-rays. X-rays have shorter wavelengths than visible light. Infrared radiation has longer wavelengths than visible light.  Therefore, only the pairs correctly describing the relative wavelengths of X-rays and infrared radiation are accurate.  The other options demonstrate a confusion regarding the electromagnetic spectrum and the relative wavelengths of different types of radiation.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate pairings of chemical elements and their associated industrial activities. Mercury is a byproduct of gold mining, and its presence in the environment is a major concern due to its toxicity. Bromine is a key component in the production of certain fertilizers. Hydrogen is a product of the chlor-alkali process, a crucial industrial method for producing chlorine and sodium hydroxide. Lastly, tantalum's high melting point, corrosion resistance, and other properties make it vital in the electronics industry, particularly in the manufacturing of semiconductors.  The other options are incomplete, failing to recognize the valid connections across all four pairs.


**2. With reference to the properties of materials, consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Property
1. Graphene                    : High surface area

3. Tantalum                     : High corrosion resistance
4. Mercury                     : Liquid at room temperature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately links a material to one of its key properties. Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, possesses an exceptionally high surface area due to its two-dimensional structure. Silver is well-known for its excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, making it a valuable material in various applications. Tantalum is a refractory metal, meaning it has a very high melting point and exceptional resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures.  Finally, mercury is unique among common metals for being liquid at standard room temperature and pressure.  Therefore, all four pairings are correct, making option (d) the only viable choice.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Radioactive Isotope           Application/Characteristic
1. Carbon-14                     : Radiometric dating of organic materials
2. Calcium-41                    : Radiometric dating of older materials
3. Tritium                        : Radioactive isotope of hydrogen
4.  Uranium-238                  :  Used in nuclear power plants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate associations. Carbon-14 is widely used in radiocarbon dating to determine the age of organic materials. Calcium-41, with its longer half-life than Carbon-14, is a relatively recent discovery useful for dating older materials, extending the reach of radiometric dating techniques. Tritium is indeed a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Uranium-238 is a significant fuel source in nuclear power plants.  All four pairs are correctly matched; hence, option (d) is the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of the accurate pairings.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All the descriptions accurately reflect the astronomical phenomena. FRBs are intense, short-lived bursts of radio waves originating from distant galaxies. GRBs are the most powerful explosions known in the universe, often associated with the birth or death of black holes. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity, generated by extremely energetic events like colliding black holes.  Solar flares are sudden, intense releases of energy from the sun's surface. Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the only correct response.  Other options are incomplete, omitting accurate pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

4. JUICE Mission                 : Focused on studying Jupiter and its moons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c) All three

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) does indeed provide a positioning accuracy of around 10 meters, superior to some other global systems. GAGAN (GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation) is specifically designed as a Satellite Based Augmentation System to enhance the accuracy and reliability of GPS signals for aviation purposes.  Finally, GPS (Global Positioning System) is a satellite navigation system developed and maintained by the United States.  The JUICE mission's focus on Jupiter and its moons is also accurately described.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don't account for the accuracy of all the pairings.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on evaporation and related concepts.  Each question adheres to the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Feature             Process Primarily Influenced
    1. Oceans                           :   Salinity
    2. Continents                       :   Water Availability
    3.  Great Australian Desert        :   Insolation
    4.  Rajasthan                         :   Atmospheric Pressure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Explanation:**

Evaporation from oceans is significantly influenced by salinity. Higher salinity leads to a lower rate of evaporation because the dissolved salts reduce the vapor pressure of water.  Water availability on continents directly impacts the rate of evaporation; areas with abundant water sources will experience higher evaporation rates. The Great Australian Desert, with its high levels of insolation (incoming solar radiation), experiences intense evaporation.  While Rajasthan's climate does influence evaporation, atmospheric pressure is a more general factor affecting evaporation across various regions, not specific to Rajasthan alone. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes pair 4, which lacks a direct, specific, and exclusive link between Rajasthan and atmospheric pressure in the context of evaporation.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while option (c) accurately reflects the most precise and demonstrably correct pairings.


**2. With reference to the factors affecting evaporation, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                                   Effect on Evaporation Rate
    1. Increased Surface Area               :   Increase
    2. Increased Wind Speed                  :   Decrease
    3. Increased Relative Humidity           :   Decrease
    4. Increased Air Pressure                :   Decrease
    5. Increased Water Temperature           :   Increase


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Explanation:**

A larger surface area exposes more water molecules to the atmosphere, increasing the rate of evaporation (1). Higher wind speeds remove water vapor from the surface, facilitating further evaporation and thus increasing the rate (not decreasing).  Increased relative humidity means the air is already saturated with water vapor, reducing the evaporation rate (3). Higher air pressure reduces the rate of evaporation because it hinders the escape of water molecules into the atmosphere (4).  Higher water temperatures provide water molecules with more kinetic energy, enabling them to overcome intermolecular forces and escape into the atmosphere more readily, leading to a faster evaporation rate (5).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 demonstrate a correct relationship. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, showcasing distractors that are plausible but ultimately flawed in their depiction of the relationships between factors and evaporation rates.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Water                      Evaporation Rate
    1. Fresh Water                      :   Higher
    2. Salt Water                        :   Lower
    3. Water with High Boiling Point    :   Lower
    4. Water at Saturation Point        :   Zero


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Explanation:**

Freshwater evaporates faster than saltwater due to the lower vapor pressure of saltwater caused by dissolved salts (1). A higher boiling point implies stronger intermolecular forces, making it harder for molecules to escape into the gaseous phase, thus lowering the evaporation rate (3). At the saturation point, the rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensation, resulting in a net zero evaporation rate (4). All these pairs accurately represent the relationships between the type of water and its evaporation rate.  Therefore, option (c) is correct. The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs, serving as effective distractors for those who might have incomplete knowledge of the factors affecting evaporation.


**4. With reference to the hydrological cycle, consider the following pairs:**

    Process                                      Stage of Hydrological Cycle
    1.  Transpiration from Plants             :   Evaporation
    2.  Capillary Action in Soil                :   Infiltration
    3.  Condensation in the Atmosphere       :   Precipitation
    4.  Runoff from Land Surface               :   Surface Flow


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Explanation:**

Transpiration, the release of water vapor from plants, is a form of evaporation (1). Capillary action moves water from the soil surface into the ground, contributing to infiltration (2). Condensation in the atmosphere forms clouds and eventually leads to precipitation (3). Runoff flows over land surfaces and is part of the surface flow component of the hydrological cycle (4).  All the pairs listed accurately depict the stages of the hydrological cycle. Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer. The other options are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair, acting as effective distractors by testing the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the hydrological cycle.




**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Material                                      Property Related to Evaporation
    1. Cotton                                     :   High Water Absorption
    2.  Gold                                      :   High Thermal Conductivity
    3.  Silver                                    :   High Electrical Conductivity
    4.  Plastic (Thermosetting)                  :   Heat Resistance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only


**Explanation:**

Cotton's high water absorption capacity makes it suitable for summer clothing because it readily absorbs sweat and facilitates evaporation, keeping the body cool (1). Thermosetting plastics are known for their heat resistance; this property is not directly related to evaporation but is a material characteristic that might influence its use in applications where evaporation is occurring (4). The high thermal and electrical conductivity of gold and silver are not directly related to the process of evaporation.  These properties are relevant to other applications of these metals, but they do not influence evaporation.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect, serving as distractors by including pairs whose properties are not directly related to the process of evaporation in a significant way.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Process                     Associated Molecule
1. Photosynthesis                         :   Chlorophyll
2. Respiration                           :   ATP
3. DNA Replication                       :   RNA Polymerase
4. Protein Synthesis                    :   mRNA
5. Gene Editing                          :   Cas9 enzyme

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. Respiration is a metabolic process that involves the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of cells.  DNA replication involves the synthesis of new DNA strands using existing DNA as a template and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, but not RNA polymerase which is involved in transcription. Protein synthesis is the process of creating proteins from the information encoded in mRNA (messenger RNA).  Gene editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, utilize the Cas9 enzyme to precisely cut DNA at specific locations, allowing for targeted modifications. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Entity                       Associated Characteristic

5.  Red Blood Cells (RBCs)              :   Haemoglobin production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, the primary site of aerobic respiration. Chloroplasts, found in plant cells, contain their own DNA, known as cpDNA. Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis. Lysosomes are organelles containing digestive enzymes.  However, Haemoglobin production primarily occurs in bone marrow, not in red blood cells themselves. RBCs transport haemoglobin. Thus, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 5 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                    Biological Role/Source

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Urea is a major nitrogenous waste product excreted by mammals. Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of cellular respiration. Ascorbic acid is chemically known as Vitamin C. Ethylene is a plant hormone that plays a crucial role in various growth and developmental processes. Magnesium is an essential element for photosynthesis, acting as a central atom in the chlorophyll molecule. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Genetic Material                    Associated Process

3.  mtDNA                               :   Mitochondrial function
4. cpDNA                               :   Photosynthesis
5.  Histones                            :   DNA packaging


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

DNA serves as the template for transcription, the process of creating mRNA.  mRNA carries the genetic code for protein synthesis during translation. mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) is crucial for mitochondrial function. cpDNA (chloroplast DNA) is essential for photosynthesis within chloroplasts. Histones are proteins that help package and organize DNA within chromosomes. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Process                     Related Concept
1. Photosynthesis                       :   Light-dependent reactions
2. Respiration                           :   Cellular respiration
3.  Gene Expression                    :   Transcription and translation
4.  DNA Replication                     :   Semi-conservative replication
5.  Immunological Memory                :   Adaptive immunity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis involves light-dependent reactions that capture light energy. Respiration is a broader term encompassing cellular respiration, the process of energy production in cells. Gene expression includes both transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein). DNA replication is a semi-conservative process, meaning each new DNA molecule retains one strand from the original. Immunological memory is a key feature of adaptive immunity. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound           Property/Characteristic
1. Urea                         :  High nitrogen content
2. Ammonia                     :  Precursor to urea production
3. Ammonium (NH4+)            :  Product of urea breakdown
4.  Nano Urea                   :  Replaces conventional urea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Urea is a chemical compound with a high nitrogen content, making it a crucial component of nitrogenous fertilizers.  Ammonia serves as a direct precursor in the industrial synthesis of urea.  The breakdown of urea in the environment, particularly in soil, leads to the formation of ammonium (NH4+), a readily available form of nitrogen for plants. Nano Urea is a new technology developed as a substitute for conventional urea, offering concentrated nutrients in a smaller package. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, reflecting the chemical properties and agricultural applications of urea and related compounds. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of these accurately paired relationships.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                      Urea-Related Activity
1. Bangladesh                 :   Major importer of urea
2. Nepal                        :   Significant exporter of urea
3. India                        :   Regulates domestic urea prices
4. USA                         :  Major producer of urea fertilizers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bangladesh is a significant importer of urea to meet its agricultural demands. India, a major urea producer, heavily regulates the domestic price of urea to ensure affordability for farmers. The USA is a substantial producer of urea-based fertilizers, contributing to the global fertilizer market. Nepal, while possibly importing some urea, is not primarily known as a major exporter of urea. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes Bangladesh. Option (b) is partially correct but omits a significant urea producer. Option (c) is incorrect as it excludes a crucial importer and includes a country that is not a major exporter.  Therefore, only option (d) accurately reflects the relationships between countries and their involvement in the urea market.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fertilizer Type              Characteristic/Component
1. DAP                          :   Contains Urea as a component
2. MoP                          :  Primarily a Potash fertilizer
3. Complex Fertilizers          :  Contain Urea and other nutrients
4.  Organic Fertilizers          :  Naturally derived, contain urea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Complex fertilizers are formulations containing a blend of nutrients, including urea, alongside other essential elements like phosphorus and potassium.  DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) is a phosphorus-based fertilizer; while it might be used in conjunction with urea, it does not inherently contain urea as a component. MoP (Muriate of Potash) is primarily a potassium fertilizer. Organic fertilizers are naturally derived and do not contain synthetic urea. Therefore, only the pairing of Complex Fertilizers with their characteristic of containing urea and other nutrients is entirely accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccurate pairings of fertilizer types and their components or characteristics.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Policy          Relationship to Urea
1. NBS scheme                  :  Includes urea subsidies
2. Government of India         :   Controls urea pricing
3. Fertilizer Subsidies         :  Directly subsidizes urea
4.  Chemical Companies         :  Primary users of urea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Government of India plays a significant role in controlling the pricing of urea to ensure affordability and availability for farmers. Fertilizer subsidies are government programs designed to support agricultural production; a significant portion of these subsidies goes towards urea. Chemical companies are major users of urea, employing it in various industrial processes and formulations. The NBS (Nutrient Based Subsidy) scheme, while aiming to improve fertilizer use efficiency, does not directly include urea subsidies in the same way as other direct subsidy programs. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the NBS scheme's role in urea subsidies. Only option (c) accurately portrays the relationship between organizations/policies and their involvement with urea.

3. Urea is primarily produced in the liver.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Urea plays a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle, contributing to the availability of nitrogen for plants and other organisms.  Urea is not a product of starch digestion; starch is a carbohydrate broken down into simpler sugars. Urea is a metabolic waste product primarily synthesized in the liver. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct. Statement 2 is factually incorrect, representing a common misconception about urea's origin. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false statement about starch digestion or exclude the accurate statement regarding urea's hepatic origin.  Only option (c) accurately reflects the correct statements.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. Lithium is a key component in many batteries and is abundantly found in the Lithium Triangle (a region in South America). Iron is a well-known conductor of electricity. Argon is an inert gas frequently used in light bulbs to prevent oxidation. Potassium is essential for various plant functions. Chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for photosynthesis, contains nitrogen. Therefore, option (c) encompassing all correctly matched pairs is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they leave out at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests factual knowledge of materials science and chemistry.



**6. With reference to heat transfer mechanisms, consider the following pairs:**

   Process/Phenomenon             Heat Transfer Mechanism
1. Boiling water                   : Convection
2. Land and sea breeze            : Convection
3. Heating of a glass bulb surface : Conduction
4. Circulation of air around a blast furnace: Convection
5.  Formation of clouds           : Convection

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Boiling water involves the movement of heated water molecules, a clear example of convection. Land and sea breezes are caused by differences in air temperature and density, again driven by convection.  The heating of a glass bulb surface is due to the direct transfer of heat from the filament through the glass, which is conduction. Circulation of air in a blast furnace is convective heat transfer. Cloud formation is a result of rising warm, moist air (convection).  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct choice. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of cloud formation with convection. Option (c) is wrong because it incorrectly includes the heating of the glass bulb surface as convection. Option (d) is wrong because it only includes a single correct pairing. This question assesses understanding of heat transfer mechanisms.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Diamond                      Low hardness
3. Graphene                    Derived from coal
4.  Cast iron                   High carbon content

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphite is known for its excellent electrical conductivity due to the delocalized electrons in its layered structure.  Diamond, conversely, is an electrical insulator because its carbon atoms are strongly bonded in a rigid three-dimensional network, leaving no free electrons for conduction.  Therefore, pair 1 is correct and pair 2 is incorrect. Graphene is indeed derived from graphite, not coal. Coal is a complex mixture containing carbon, but it is not the direct source of graphene.  Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms extracted from graphite. Pair 3 is incorrect. Cast iron does indeed have a high carbon content, typically ranging from 2% to 4%, which is what gives it its characteristic properties. Therefore, pair 4 is correct.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gas                          Atmospheric Property
1. Argon                        Major component of Earth's atmosphere
2. Carbon dioxide              Inversely proportional to oxygen levels
3. Water vapor                  Absorbs infrared radiation
4. Nitrogen                     Essential for photosynthesis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Argon is a significant component of Earth's atmosphere, making up about 0.93% of its volume.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  While carbon dioxide levels are related to other atmospheric components, a direct inverse proportion to oxygen levels isn't a universally accurate representation.  The relationship is more complex and influenced by various factors. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. Water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, effectively absorbing infrared radiation and contributing to the Earth's heat budget. Pair 3 is correct.  Nitrogen is an inert gas that plays no direct role in photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis primarily relies on carbon dioxide and water. Pair 4 is incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                       Composition
1. Diamond                        Carbon atoms in a three-dimensional network
2. Graphite                       Carbon atoms in a hexagonal network
3. Coal                             High percentage of carbon
4. Peat                             Low percentage of carbon

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Diamond's crystalline structure is characterized by a strong three-dimensional network of carbon atoms bonded covalently.  Graphite has a layered structure with carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal networks.  Both pairs 1 and 2 are correct descriptions of their respective atomic structures. Coal is a sedimentary rock formed from the accumulation and compression of plant matter over geological time scales; it is primarily composed of carbon, with varying levels of other elements. Pair 3 is correct.  Peat is an early stage in coal formation, with a significantly lower carbon content compared to mature coal.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Element                       Application
1. Caesium                       Atomic clocks
2. Potassium                     Timekeeping in some clocks
3. Xenon                         Photographer's flashguns
4. Argon                          Used in welding

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Caesium's highly precise atomic transitions make it ideal for use in atomic clocks, which are the most accurate timekeeping devices available. Pair 1 is correct.  While potassium has isotopes, it is not the primary element used in atomic clocks; caesium is far more commonly employed due to its superior precision. Pair 2 is incorrect. Xenon is used in photographer's flashguns due to its ability to emit bright light upon excitation. Pair 3 is correct.  Argon is an inert gas, often used in welding to create an inert atmosphere to protect the weld from oxidation. Pair 4 is correct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Material                     Use/Property
1.  Steel                        Contains carbon
2. Biofuels                      Reduce carbon dioxide emissions
3.  Lab-grown diamonds          High hardness
4.  Tantalum                     Low corrosion resistance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Steel is an alloy primarily made of iron and carbon, with carbon content influencing its properties.  Pair 1 is correct.  Biofuels, derived from biomass, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions compared to fossil fuels, although their lifecycle emissions can vary. Pair 2 is correct. Lab-grown diamonds possess the same physical and chemical properties as naturally occurring diamonds, including high hardness and refractive index. Pair 3 is correct. Tantalum is renowned for its exceptionally high corrosion resistance, making it suitable for applications in corrosive environments.  Pair 4 is incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Process                     Product/Outcome
1. Photosynthesis               Produces carbon dioxide
2. Decomposition              Produces carbon dioxide
3. Combustion of fossil fuels   Produces carbon dioxide
4.  Ocean acidification          Increases atmospheric carbon dioxide

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, not the other way around. Pair 1 is incorrect.  Decomposition of organic matter, whether through microbial activity or other processes, releases carbon dioxide. Pair 2 is correct.  The combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Pair 3 is correct. Ocean acidification is caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans, not the other way around; increased atmospheric carbon dioxide leads to more carbon dioxide dissolving in the ocean. Pair 4 is incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Radiation Type                 Property
1. Infrared radiation           Shorter wavelength than visible light
2. Ultraviolet radiation        Higher photon energy than visible light
3. Visible light                 Longer wavelength than infrared radiation
4.  Gamma rays                  Highest energy electromagnetic radiation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Infrared radiation has a longer wavelength than visible light, not shorter. Pair 1 is incorrect. Ultraviolet radiation has a shorter wavelength and therefore higher energy photons than visible light. Pair 2 is correct. Visible light has a shorter wavelength than infrared radiation. Pair 3 is incorrect. Gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Pair 4 is correct.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  Technology                      Application
1. Thermal sensors               Detect infrared radiation
2. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) Type of nuclear reactor
3.  CRISPR/Cas9                   Genome editing
4.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)  Radiometric dating

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Thermal sensors are designed to detect infrared radiation, utilizing the thermal properties of materials to capture and measure this type of energy. Pair 1 is correct. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are a type of nuclear reactor characterized by their smaller size and modular design compared to traditional large-scale nuclear reactors. Pair 2 is correct.  CRISPR/Cas9 is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that allows for precise modification of DNA sequences. Pair 3 is correct. Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a technique used in radiometric dating, particularly for long-lived isotopes like Calcium-41. Pair 4 is correct.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type                      Key Feature
1. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) : Uses liquid sodium as coolant
2. Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)       :  Uses natural uranium as fuel
3. Small Modular Reactor (SMR)      : Factory-built, modular design

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are indeed characterized by their factory-built, modular design, enabling efficient mass production and easier transportation to various sites.  This modularity allows for scalability and flexibility in power output.  

Pair 1 is incorrect because PHWRs utilize heavy water as a moderator and coolant, not liquid sodium. Liquid sodium is a coolant used in Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs).  The use of heavy water is a crucial characteristic distinguishing PHWRs from other reactor types.  

Pair 2 is incorrect because while PHWRs *do* use natural uranium, it's the PHWRs, not FBRs, that primarily utilize this fuel. FBRs, designed for greater efficiency in fuel usage, typically employ a mix of uranium and plutonium or other fissile materials.  The choice of fuel is a fundamental difference between these reactor designs, reflecting their distinct operational principles and goals.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Process                    Characteristic
1. Nuclear Fusion                     : Primarily uses isotopes of uranium
2. Nuclear Fission                    : Releases massive amounts of energy
3. Chain Reaction in Nuclear Reactor :  Requires controlled conditions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, does indeed release vast amounts of energy. This energy release is the fundamental principle behind nuclear power generation.  A chain reaction within a nuclear reactor necessitates controlled conditions to prevent runaway reactions and ensure safe operation. Control rods and other mechanisms are employed to regulate the rate of fission and maintain a stable energy output.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Nuclear fusion, the combining of light atomic nuclei, primarily utilizes isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium), not uranium.  Uranium is the primary fuel for nuclear fission, not fusion.  The difference in fuel sources highlights the fundamental distinction between these two nuclear processes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                           Property
1. Coal                               : Highest energy density by weight
2. Natural Gas                         : Primarily composed of methane
3. Hydrogen                             : Lower volumetric energy density than petrol

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Natural gas is predominantly composed of methane, a simple hydrocarbon, making it a relatively clean-burning fossil fuel. Hydrogen, while possessing a high energy density *by weight*, has a significantly lower volumetric energy density compared to petrol or other liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This means that storing and transporting the same amount of energy requires a much larger volume of hydrogen.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  While coal has a substantial energy density, it is not the highest *by weight*. Hydrogen has a considerably higher energy density per unit of mass. This difference in energy density is a key factor influencing the suitability of various fuels for different applications.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Isotope                           Characteristic
1. Uranium-235                        :  Not used in nuclear reactors
2. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m)          : Used in nuclear medicine
3. Plutonium-239                       : Byproduct of PHWRs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is a crucial medical isotope used extensively in various diagnostic imaging procedures due to its short half-life and gamma-ray emission properties.  Plutonium-239 is indeed a byproduct of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), a fact relevant to considerations of nuclear fuel cycles and waste management.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Uranium-235 is a crucial fissile isotope used as fuel in many nuclear reactors, including PHWRs. Its ability to undergo chain reactions is essential for nuclear power generation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                 Application
1. Silicon                               : Not a semiconductor
2. Germanium                             : Used in diodes
3. Plaster of Paris                        : Used to fix fractured bones

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Plaster of Paris, a readily available and relatively inexpensive material, is commonly used in medical settings as a cast to immobilize fractured bones during the healing process.  

Pair 1 is incorrect because silicon is a fundamental semiconductor material, widely used in electronics and other technological applications.  Its semiconducting properties are a direct result of its electronic structure.

Pair 2 is correct. Germanium is indeed used in diodes, although its use has diminished somewhat compared to silicon due to the latter's superior properties for many applications.  Both are semiconductors used in various electronic components.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gas                                   Source
1. Methane                               :  Primarily found in shale gas
2. Carbon Dioxide                        : Released during coal combustion
3. Hydrogen                               :  Produced from coal gasification

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Methane is a significant component of shale gas, a natural gas found trapped within shale rock formations.  Carbon dioxide is a major byproduct released during the combustion of coal, a process that contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions.  Hydrogen can be produced through coal gasification, a process that converts coal into a mixture of gases, including hydrogen, which can be separated and used as a fuel or chemical feedstock.  These matches reflect fundamental facts about the sources and production of these important gases.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cellular Component                     Function/Characteristic
1. Mitochondria                           :   Site of protein synthesis
2. Chloroplast                            :   Produces ATP
3. Ribosomes                              :   Site of photosynthesis
4. Lysosomes                              :   Intracellular digestion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles found in animal cells.  Their primary function is intracellular digestion, breaking down waste materials and cellular debris.  Option (d) correctly matches Lysosomes with their characteristic function.  The other options are incorrect. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production through cellular respiration, not protein synthesis (that's the ribosome's job). Chloroplasts are found in plant cells and are the sites of photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy. Ribosomes are the protein synthesis factories of the cell, found both free in the cytoplasm and attached to the endoplasmic reticulum.  Therefore, only the pairing of Lysosomes and intracellular digestion is accurate.  The distractors in the other options are designed to test the candidate’s precise knowledge of cellular organelles and their functions. The question demands precise factual recall of cellular biology.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Process                                     Location/Involvement
1. Photosynthesis                           :   Occurs primarily in animal cells
2. Aerobic Respiration                     :   Uses carbon dioxide as a reactant
3. Carbon Cycle                              :   Primarily involves the release of oxygen
4. ATP Production                          :   Major site is the chloroplast


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts of plant cells, not animal cells. Aerobic respiration utilizes oxygen, not carbon dioxide, as a reactant. The carbon cycle involves both the uptake and release of carbon dioxide, and while it impacts oxygen levels, the primary focus isn't oxygen release. Finally, the major site of ATP production is the mitochondrion, not the chloroplast, although chloroplasts also produce ATP during photosynthesis.  The question tests the understanding of fundamental metabolic processes and their relation to cellular structures.  The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing the examinee's comprehension of subtle differences in the processes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetic Material/Structure               Location
1. mtDNA                                   :   Nucleus
2. Mitogenome                              :   Mitochondria
3. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)              :   Chloroplast


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched.  Mitogenome, another term for mitochondrial DNA, is indeed located within the mitochondria. mtDNA (Mitochondrial DNA) is found within the mitochondria, not the nucleus or chloroplast. The inclusion of "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)" as a separate pair, with an incorrect location, serves as a clever distractor, testing the candidate's ability to identify subtle differences in terminology and their implications.  The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of the location of different types of genetic material within the cell.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Chemical Compound                       Role/Effect
1. Urea                                    :   Component of fertilizers
2. Ammonia                                 :   Product of bacterial decomposition of sugar
3. Carbon Dioxide                          :   Used to produce urea
4. Sulphur Dioxide                         :   Product of bacterial decomposition of urea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Urea is indeed a component of fertilizers. Ammonia is used in the industrial production of urea.  Sulphur dioxide is not a direct product of bacterial urea decomposition; ammonia is. The bacterial decomposition of urea primarily yields ammonia. The decomposition of sugar by bacteria produces various organic acids and gases, not primarily carbon dioxide. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of chemical compounds and their industrial and biological roles.  The inclusion of incorrect pairings, like 2 and the altered pairing of 4, serves as effective distractors, requiring a high degree of accuracy in factual recall.



**5. Consider the following statements about Photosynthesis:**

   Statement                                 Truth Value
1. Photosynthesis converts light energy into potential energy. : True
2. Photosynthesis uses hydrogen from water.                   : True
3. Photosynthesis occurs in aphotic zones.                     : False
4. Photosynthesis releases carbon dioxide.                   : False


Which of the statements given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis does convert light energy into the potential chemical energy stored in carbohydrates.  Water is a reactant in photosynthesis, and its hydrogen atoms are incorporated into the carbohydrate molecules.  Photosynthesis cannot occur in aphotic zones (areas without light).  Photosynthesis releases oxygen, not carbon dioxide.  The question assesses understanding of the process of photosynthesis and its relationship with energy transfer and elemental exchange. The inclusion of plausible but false statements adds a layer of difficulty.  Only statements 1 and 2 are true, making (a) the correct option.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Atmospheric Layer                      Characteristic
1. Stratosphere                             : Contains high concentrations of water vapor
2. Troposphere                              : Contains the ozone layer
3. Mesosphere                               : Layer above the stratosphere
4. Ozonosphere                             : Located primarily in the troposphere


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched. The mesosphere is indeed the layer above the stratosphere.  The stratosphere is characterized by a relatively low concentration of water vapor; the troposphere contains most of the atmospheric water vapor. The ozone layer is primarily located in the stratosphere, not the troposphere. The ozonosphere (ozone layer) is found in the stratosphere, not the troposphere.  The question tests knowledge of atmospheric layers and their composition. The incorrect pairings function as effective distractors, requiring precise factual recall.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound/Element              Property/Use
1. Arsenic                                 :  Causes skin cancer
2. Ozone (O3)                              :  Located in the troposphere
3. Tantalum                                :  Low melting point
4. White Phosphorus                        :  Used in fertilisers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. Arsenic exposure is linked to an increased risk of skin cancer. Ozone is found in the stratosphere, not the troposphere. Tantalum has an extremely high melting point, and white phosphorus, while used in some applications, is not a significant component of most fertilizers.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the properties and uses of various chemical compounds and elements.  The inclusion of several incorrect pairings as distractors necessitates careful attention to detail.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organelle                                   Primary Function
1. Mitochondria                               : Photosynthesis
2. Chloroplast                               :  Cellular respiration
3. Ribosomes                                 : Protein synthesis
4. Golgi apparatus                            : Lipid synthesis


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of ribosomes with protein synthesis is correct. Mitochondria are the primary sites of cellular respiration, not photosynthesis.  Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, not cellular respiration. While the Golgi apparatus is involved in various processes including lipid modification and packaging, its primary function is not solely lipid synthesis.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of cellular organelles and their functions.  The incorrect pairings act as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  Casual contact (e.g., handshake) :  Low
4.  Mother-to-child transmission      :  High
5.  Mosquito bites                     :  Low


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

HIV transmission occurs primarily through bodily fluids, making sharing needles, sexual contact, and mother-to-child transmission high-risk activities. Casual contact like handshakes does not transmit HIV. Mosquitoes are not vectors for HIV. The question tests knowledge of disease transmission and risk assessment, requiring precise understanding of epidemiological principles.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Therapy Type                  Characteristic
1.  Germline gene therapy             :   Modifications are heritable
2.  Somatic cell gene therapy         :   Modifications are not heritable
3.  Viral vector-mediated gene therapy:   Always uses retroviruses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Germline gene therapy involves modifying germ cells (sperm or egg), resulting in heritable changes.  Somatic cell gene therapy targets somatic cells, and changes are not passed on to offspring. Viral vectors are commonly used in gene therapy, but not exclusively retroviruses; other viruses like adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are also employed.  This question tests understanding of gene therapy techniques and their implications, requiring knowledge of different types of gene therapy.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Dolomite is a carbonate mineral composed primarily of calcium magnesium carbonate, CaMg(CO3)2, thus containing Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg).  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Magnesite is Magnesium Carbonate (MgCO3), making pair 2 incorrect. Limestone is primarily Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), so pair 3 is correct. Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4), thus pair 4 is correct. Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals, making pair 5 correct. Pair 2 is the only incorrect pairing.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related minerals and their compositions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Wave Type     | Description/Example
-------      | --------
P-waves       | Transverse waves
S-waves       | Longitudinal waves
Surface Waves | Rayleigh waves
Love waves    | Seismic waves


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

P-waves (primary waves) are longitudinal waves, not transverse. S-waves (secondary waves) are transverse waves, not longitudinal.  Surface waves include Rayleigh waves and Love waves, which are both types of seismic waves.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of seismic wave types and their characteristics.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates who may have a superficial understanding of wave types.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

State/Country | Dolomite Reserves/Production
-------      | --------
Andhra Pradesh | Significant Dolomite Reserves
Madhya Pradesh | Major Dolomite Producer
Karnataka      | Minor Dolomite Producer
Rajasthan      | Significant Dolomite Reserves
Odisha        | Negligible Dolomite Reserves


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan are known for significant dolomite reserves. Madhya Pradesh is a major producer of dolomite. Karnataka's dolomite production is not considered minor, and Odisha has some dolomite reserves, though not negligible.  The question tests knowledge of geographical distribution of natural resources and the ability to distinguish between reserves and production. The inclusion of Karnataka and Odisha serves as plausible distractors.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Industrial Use  | Mineral Used
-------      | --------
Cement Industry | Magnesite
Fertilizer Industry | Dolomite
Iron and Steel Industry | Limestone
Glass Industry | Dolomite


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Dolomite is used extensively in the fertilizer industry due to its calcium and magnesium content. Dolomite is also a fluxing agent in the glass industry. Magnesite is not primarily used in the cement industry, while limestone is a key component of cement, not primarily used in iron and steel production, although it has some applications.  The question tests knowledge of industrial applications of minerals, requiring accurate recall and the ability to identify incorrect pairings.



**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Dolomite application in agriculture increases soil pH.
2.  Dolomite is a source of Magnesium (Mg).
3.  P-waves are also known as longitudinal waves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Dolomite application in agriculture actually *mitigates* soil acidification, but it doesn't directly increase soil pH.  The primary effect is neutralization of acidity.  Dolomite is indeed a source of Magnesium (Mg). P-waves (primary waves) are longitudinal waves. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.  The other statements contain elements of truth but are not completely accurate when strictly interpreted. This question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in statements.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                    Effect/Contribution to Environmental Problem
1. Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)                 :   Eutrophication of water bodies
2. Nitric Acid                            :   Acidification of soil
3. Ammonia (NH3)                        :   Acid rain formation
4. Methane (CH4)                         :   Global warming

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Nitric acid, a strong acid, directly contributes to the acidification of soil when deposited through acid rain or other pathways.  This leads to decreased soil fertility, damage to plant life, and mobilization of heavy metals.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  Sulphur dioxide is a major precursor to acid rain, not eutrophication. Eutrophication is primarily caused by excessive nutrients like nitrates and phosphates leading to algal blooms.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While ammonia contributes to acid rain indirectly through nitrification (conversion to nitric acid), its primary environmental impact is related to eutrophication and air pollution.

Pair 4 is correct in that methane is a potent greenhouse gas, contributing significantly to global warming. However, it is not directly related to acid rain, so this pair is incorrect in the context of the question's pairing.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                  Property/Use
1. Limestone                               :   Main component of Portland cement
2. Synthetic Rubber                        :   Grown only in tropical countries
3. Hydrogen                               :   Produced exclusively through electrolysis
4.  Bakelite                               :   First man-made plastic


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched. Limestone is a crucial component used in the manufacturing of Portland cement, a widely used construction material.

Pair 4 is correctly matched. Bakelite is historically recognized as one of the earliest synthetic plastics developed.

Pair 2 is incorrect.  Synthetic rubber is not grown; it's a manufactured material. Natural rubber, on the other hand, is primarily grown in tropical regions.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While electrolysis is a common method for hydrogen production, particularly "green" hydrogen, it's not the exclusive method.  Hydrogen can also be produced from fossil fuels (natural gas, etc.) through steam methane reforming.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gas                                      Source/Association
1. Methane                                 :   Primary component of natural gas
2. Hydrogen                               :   Released mostly from landfills
3. Nitrogen                               :   Used in the production of pesticides
4. Oxygen                                  :   Weakens human immunity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  Methane is the primary component of natural gas, a significant energy source.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Methane, a byproduct of anaerobic decomposition, is the gas mostly released from landfills.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Methyl isocyanate, not nitrogen gas, was used in the production of pesticides (in the Bhopal incident). While nitrogen is a component of fertilizers, its use in pesticide production is not a primary association.

Pair 4 is incorrect.  The HIV virus, which attacks lymphocytes, weakens the immune system. Oxygen is essential for life.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Phenomenon/Problem        Characteristic/Effect
1. Eutrophication                          :   Effective pollution control measure
2. Acid Rain                               :   Reacts with buildings made of limestone
3.  Burning sulphur-containing coal       :   Contributes to acid rain


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Acid rain, due to its low pH, reacts with and erodes limestone-based structures.  The burning of coal containing sulfur releases sulfur dioxide, a significant contributor to acid rain formation.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Eutrophication is not an effective pollution control measure; it's a type of water pollution caused by excessive nutrients.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1. Hydrogen has no isotopes.
2. Hydrogen and oxygen form an explosive mixture.
3. Hydrogen is the lightest element.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 3 are correct.  Hydrogen and oxygen, when mixed in certain proportions, form a highly explosive mixture. Hydrogen is indeed the lightest element on the periodic table.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Hydrogen has isotopes, including deuterium and tritium, which differ in the number of neutrons.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cell Type                     Category
1. B cells                         :   Granulocytes
2. T cells                         :   Agranulocytes
3. Monocytes                       :   Lymphocytes
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

B cells and T cells are both types of lymphocytes, a crucial component of the adaptive immune system.  Option (b) correctly identifies T cells as agranulocytes.  Lymphocytes are agranulocytes, meaning they lack prominent cytoplasmic granules.  B cells, while also lymphocytes, are incorrectly paired with granulocytes in option 1. Granulocytes, such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, are characterized by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm. Monocytes are also agranulocytes but are incorrectly paired with lymphocytes in option 3;  while they are part of the innate immune system and differentiate into macrophages, they are not lymphocytes. Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misclassify at least one cell type.  Understanding the fundamental differences between granulocytes and agranulocytes, and the classification of lymphocytes, is crucial for comprehending the immune system's functioning.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of basic cell biology and immunology.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound          Effect on Oxygen Transport
1. Carbon monoxide (CO)       :   Enhances oxygen binding to hemoglobin
2. Carboxyhaemoglobin       :   Prevents oxygen transport
3. Oxyhaemoglobin             :   Reduces oxygen carrying capacity
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin with much greater affinity than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin. This prevents oxygen from binding to hemoglobin, leading to hypoxia (oxygen deficiency).  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect because CO competes with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin, thus hindering, not enhancing, oxygen transport. Pair 3 is incorrect because oxyhemoglobin is the oxygen-bound form of hemoglobin, responsible for oxygen transport;  a reduction in its concentration would indeed reduce oxygen-carrying capacity, but the statement in the pair is not precise enough to be considered correct. The question tests the understanding of the physiological effects of CO poisoning and the role of hemoglobin in oxygen transport.  A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gas exchange is essential for correctly answering this question.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Carbon Dioxide       Process
1. Fossil fuels combustion        :   Photosynthesis
2. Decomposition of organic matter:   Cellular Respiration
3. Enhanced Weathering          :   Carbon sequestration
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The decomposition of organic matter releases carbon dioxide as a byproduct of microbial respiration.  Enhanced weathering, a geoengineering technique, involves accelerating the natural process of silicate rock weathering to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect; fossil fuel combustion releases carbon dioxide, but it is not directly related to photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy, consuming carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the carbon cycle and its various processes, including both natural and anthropogenic influences.  A solid understanding of the interplay between different carbon reservoirs and fluxes is crucial for answering this question.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vitamin                        Disease
1. Vitamin A                     :   Beriberi
2. Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)         :   Scurvy
3. Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)     :   Rickets
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. Vitamin A deficiency leads to night blindness and other vision problems, not beriberi. Beriberi is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine). Scurvy is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), not vitamin B1. Rickets is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, not vitamin C. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of vitamins and their associated deficiency diseases.  Accurate recall of the specific vitamins and their roles in maintaining human health is necessary to correctly answer this question, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge in nutrition.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Bone Marrow Component       Function
1.  B cells                       :  Oxygen Transport
2.  T cells                       :  Antigen Presentation
3.  Haemoglobin                  :  Antibody Production
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are incorrectly matched. B cells and T cells are produced in the bone marrow, but their primary functions are not oxygen transport or antigen presentation, respectively. B cells produce antibodies. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity and do not primarily present antigens (that role is played by antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells and macrophages). Haemoglobin is an iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, not an antibody-producing component of bone marrow. This question tests understanding of hematopoiesis (blood cell formation) and the functions of different immune cells.  The distractors highlight potential confusions between the different cell types and their functions, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of cellular biology and immunology.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Application
1. Artificial Insemination (AI)    :   Introduction of egg only
2. Sex Sorted Semen             :   Used in Artificial Insemination
3. Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy:  Replacing faulty mitochondria in the mother's egg
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Artificial insemination involves the introduction of sperms, not eggs, into the uterus.  Sex-sorted semen is a technology used to separate X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm, thereby enhancing the chances of having a child of a specific sex; it is indeed used in artificial insemination. Mitochondrial replacement therapy involves replacing faulty mitochondria in a mother's egg or embryo with healthy ones from a donor egg.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question assesses understanding of assisted reproductive technologies and their mechanisms.  The distractor in pair 1 highlights a common misconception about the procedure of artificial insemination.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                           Transmission Method
1. Hepatitis C                       :   Blood-borne, similar to HIV
2. Lymphatic Filariasis (LF)        :   Mosquito-borne
3. Nipah Virus (NiV)                :   Direct human-to-human transmission only
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Hepatitis C is indeed primarily transmitted through blood contact, sharing needles, or inadequately sterilized medical equipment, similar to HIV transmission routes. Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by parasitic worms.  Pair 3 is incorrect because Nipah virus can be transmitted through contaminated food and directly between humans, but it also has zoonotic origins (animal-to-human transmission). This question tests knowledge of infectious diseases and their transmission mechanisms.  The distractor in pair 3 highlights the complexity of disease spread and the importance of understanding multiple routes of transmission.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Gene Therapy           Characteristic
1. Germline gene therapy         :   Modifications are heritable
2. Somatic cell gene therapy    :   Modifications are not heritable
3.  Both germline and somatic therapy:   Used for treating inherited genetic diseases
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Germline gene therapy involves modifying germ cells (egg or sperm), resulting in heritable changes. Somatic cell gene therapy modifies somatic cells, and the modifications are not passed on to offspring.  Both germline and somatic cell gene therapies can be used for treating inherited genetic diseases, but the heritability of the changes is the key differentiator. Pair 3 is incorrect because it's an oversimplification of the applications; while both may be used, it's not universally true. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of gene therapy techniques and their implications.  The distractor in pair 3 highlights the nuances of gene therapy applications and the importance of understanding the distinction between germline and somatic modifications.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                  Causative Agent
1.  Sickle Cell Disease      :   Abnormal Hemoglobin
2.  Haemophilia              :   Deficiency in Clotting Factors
3.  Tuberculosis (TB)        :   Virus
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Sickle cell disease is caused by a genetic mutation leading to abnormal hemoglobin production. Haemophilia is caused by a deficiency in specific clotting factors (factor VIII or IX). Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, not a virus.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of genetic diseases and infectious diseases.  The distractor in pair 3 highlights the importance of distinguishing between bacterial and viral infections.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immunological Concept       Description
1.  Herd Immunity             :   Reluctance to vaccination
2.  Vaccine Hesitancy        :   Protection from infection in a large population
3.  Immunosenescence         :   Deterioration of immune system with age
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that occurs when a significant portion of a population is immune, either through vaccination or prior infection. Vaccine hesitancy refers to the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines. Immunosenescence is the age-related decline in the immune system's effectiveness. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes the description of vaccine hesitancy to herd immunity. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of key concepts in immunology and public health. The distractor in pair 1 tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between herd immunity and vaccine hesitancy.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Astronomical Phenomenon                 Associated Technology/Instrument
1. Gravitational Waves Detection           :   Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)
2. Observation of Quasars demonstrating Time Dilation :   James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
3. Detailed Mapping of Dark Matter         :   Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)
4. Study of Astrophysical Phenomena at Low Radio Frequencies: Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is indeed used for detailed mapping of dark matter.  By observing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation and how it's warped by the gravitational pull of large structures, including dark matter, ACT provides crucial data for creating dark matter maps.  Options 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect pairings. While the GMRT studies astrophysical phenomena, it's not primarily associated with gravitational wave detection; that role belongs to observatories like LIGO.  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observes in the infrared and visible spectrum, not directly designed for detecting time dilation in quasars, although its observations might provide supporting data for such studies.  Finally, LIGO, not GMRT, is the primary instrument for detecting gravitational waves.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space-Based Observatory                    Description/Characteristic
1. Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)  :   Underground infrastructure for gravitational wave detection
2. Einstein Telescope                          :   Space-based gravitational wave observatory
3. eLISA                                      :   Consists of a “Mother” and two “Daughter” spacecrafts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. eLISA (evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is indeed described as consisting of a "Mother" and two "Daughter" spacecraft.  The other options are incorrect. LISA is a space-based observatory, not an underground one, and the Einstein Telescope is planned as a ground-based (underground) observatory, not a space-based one.  Therefore, only the description of eLISA is accurately paired with its characteristics.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Black Hole                      Characteristic
1. Primordial Black Hole                   :   Resides at the center of most large galaxies
2. Supermassive Black Hole                :   Formed from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova
3. Stellar Black Hole                      :   Formed in the very first second after the Big Bang


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Primordial black holes are theorized to have formed in the very early universe, shortly after the Big Bang.  Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of galaxies, and stellar black holes form from the collapse of massive stars.  The descriptions in pairs 1 and 2 are incorrectly assigned to the black hole types.  Therefore, only the description in pair 3 is accurate.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Term in Astronomy          Description
1.  Goldilocks Zone                     :   A brief burst of electromagnetic radiation seen in radio-wave frequencies
2.  Fast Radio Burst (FRB)             :   Region around a planet dominated by the planet's magnetic field
3.  Magnetosphere                      :   A region in space where conditions are potentially suitable for life


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Goldilocks zone refers to the habitable zone around a star where conditions are right for liquid water to exist on a planet's surface, potentially supporting life. A magnetosphere is the region surrounding a planet where its magnetic field dominates.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect; a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) is a short, intense burst of radio waves from deep space, not related to a magnetosphere.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Instrument                     Application/Function
1.  Nabhmitra                               :   A finite element analysis (FEA) software for structures
2.  FEAST (Finite Element Analysis of Structures) :   Satellite-based communication system for fishermen’s safety
3.  GMRT                                   :   Observing the brightening of BL Lacertae, a blazar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nabhmitra is a satellite-based communication system designed to improve safety for fishermen at sea. The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) is indeed used for astronomical observations, including the monitoring of blazars.  However, FEAST is a software for structural analysis, not a communication system.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Space Agency Development          Description/Project
1.  Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) :   Developed the  Aditya-L1 solar mission
2.  ISRO's Space Applications Centre (SAC) :   Developed FEAST software for structural analysis
3.  ISRO                                   :   Launched Chandrayaan-3


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

ISRO's Space Applications Centre (SAC) is responsible for developing several satellite-based applications, and VSSC developed FEAST software.  ISRO launched Chandrayaan-3.  The Aditya-L1 mission was a collaborative effort within ISRO, but not solely attributed to VSSC. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Wave                                     Characteristic/Occurrence
1.  Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) Waves :   Observed in the Indian Antarctic station, Maitri
2.  Gravitational Waves                           :   Ripples in space-time caused by moving massive objects
3.  Pc1 pearl oscillations                        :   Amplitude-modulated structured narrow-band signals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

EMIC waves were indeed identified at the Maitri station in Antarctica. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by accelerating massive objects. Pc1 pearl oscillations are a specific type of geomagnetic signal. All three pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Concept/Technology                  Description
1.  Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)          :   Uses hybrid nanoparticles of gold and copper sulphide for cancer treatment
2.  Nanohybrids                               :   A type of wireless implant enabling brain-computer interaction
3.  Phage Therapy                              :   Treatment utilizing viruses to target specific bacteria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system that allows direct communication between the brain and an external device. Nanohybrids are a type of material used in various applications, including medicine, but not specifically for brain-computer interaction. Phage therapy uses bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to treat bacterial infections.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease/Health Issue                            Description/Characteristic
1.  Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)             :   Related to the use of non-sugar sweeteners
2.  Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)         :   Caused by the overuse of antibiotics
3.  Sickle Cell Disease                         :   A genetic blood disorder


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are chronic diseases that are not transmitted from person to person, and sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder affecting red blood cells. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of drugs, usually caused by the overuse or misuse of antibiotics, not related to sweeteners.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Technology/Concept                   Description
1.  Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)    :   A type of nuclear reactor
2.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)           :   Used for storing energy from renewable sources
3.  Net Energy Gain (NEG)                     :   The net energy produced by an energy source


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are indeed a type of nuclear reactor. Net energy gain (NEG) refers to the net amount of usable energy produced by an energy source, subtracting the energy required for its extraction and processing.  Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are used for storing energy, often from renewable sources, but they are not themselves energy sources like SMRs.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Region/Feature          Meteorological Condition/Variable
1. Southern Hemisphere                  :   High pressure gradient near the surface
2. Peninsular India                      :   Strong influence of pressure gradient on winds
3. Closely spaced isobars              :   Weak pressure gradient
4. Widely spaced isobars                :   Strong pressure gradient

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 2:** Peninsular India experiences significant variations in pressure, particularly during monsoons, leading to strong pressure gradients that drive wind patterns.  The influence of pressure gradients is a key factor in understanding the regional wind systems of the Indian subcontinent.

* **Pair 4:** Widely spaced isobars indicate a gentle change in pressure over a distance, thus reflecting a weaker pressure gradient.  Conversely, closely spaced isobars (incorrectly matched in pair 3) represent a steep pressure change and therefore a stronger pressure gradient.

* **Pair 1:** While pressure gradients exist in the Southern Hemisphere, stating they are "high" is an oversimplification. Pressure gradients vary significantly depending on geographical location and season.  The statement is too general to be considered definitively correct.


* **Pair 3:** This is incorrect. Closely spaced isobars indicate a *strong* pressure gradient, not a weak one.  The closer the isobars, the steeper the pressure change over a short distance, and consequently, the stronger the pressure gradient force driving the wind.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Meteorological Concept/Factor        Description/Effect
1. Pressure gradient                      :   Describes the rate of change in temperature
2. Isobars                               :   Lines connecting points of equal humidity
3. Wind speed                             :   Unaffected by pressure gradient
4. Geostrophic wind                       :   Primarily influenced by friction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

* **Pair 1:** A pressure gradient describes the rate of change in *pressure*, not temperature, over a distance. This is a fundamental concept in meteorology.

* **Pair 2:** Isobars connect points of equal *pressure*, not humidity.  Isohyets are the lines connecting points of equal humidity.

* **Pair 3:** Wind speed is directly *affected* by the pressure gradient. A stronger pressure gradient leads to a faster wind speed,  all else being equal.

* **Pair 4:** Geostrophic wind is primarily influenced by the balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force, not friction. Friction plays a role, especially near the surface, but it is not the primary influence on geostrophic wind.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Physical Force                         Effect/Application
1. Frictional force                       :   Increases the speed of moving objects
2. Pressure                               :   Acts perpendicular to the surface
3. Pressure                               :   Always overcomes frictional force

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.

* **Pair 2:** Pressure acts perpendicular to the surface it acts upon. This is a fundamental principle in physics.

* **Pair 1:** Frictional force *opposes* the motion of objects, thus decreasing their speed, not increasing it. Friction converts kinetic energy into heat.

* **Pair 3:** Pressure does not *always* overcome frictional force. The outcome depends on the magnitudes of both forces and the specific situation.  In many scenarios, friction is a significant force that needs to be considered.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The horizontal wind circulation near the Earth's surface is significantly influenced by the Coriolis force.
2.  The pressure gradient is the primary driving force behind horizontal wind circulation.
3.  Frictional force plays a crucial role in modifying wind patterns near the Earth's surface.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct.  Horizontal wind circulation is a complex phenomenon resulting from the interplay of several forces.

* **Statement 1:** The Coriolis force, a result of the Earth's rotation, deflects moving air masses to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection significantly influences the direction and pattern of horizontal wind circulation.

* **Statement 2:** The pressure gradient force, arising from differences in atmospheric pressure, is the fundamental driving force behind horizontal wind. Air moves from high-pressure regions to low-pressure regions, attempting to equalize the pressure difference.

* **Statement 3:** Frictional force, particularly near the Earth's surface, acts to slow down the wind. It reduces the wind speed and alters its direction, especially in the boundary layer.  The effect of friction is more pronounced near the surface and less significant at higher altitudes.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                      Primary Component
1.  Lab-grown diamond          :   Silicon Carbide
2.  Biodiesel                    :   Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME)
3.  LPG                          :   Methane
4.  Stainless Steel              :   Chromium


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Biodiesel is indeed primarily composed of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME), produced through the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. Stainless steel's crucial component is chromium, which provides its corrosion resistance.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Lab-grown diamonds are created using carbon, not silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is a different material with its own distinct properties and applications.  Pair 3 is incorrect. While methane is a component of LPG, it's not the *primary* component. LPG is primarily a mixture of propane and butane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons, including butylene and propylene. The inclusion of methane as the primary component is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of LPG composition.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                Production Method
1.  Green Hydrogen             :   Steam Methane Reforming
2.  Grey Hydrogen               :   Electrolysis using renewable energy
3.  Coalbed Methane             :   Natural Gas Extraction
4.  Biofuels                     :   Fermentation and Transesterification


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. Only Biofuels are correctly paired with their production methods.  Biofuels encompass a range of fuels derived from biological sources, which are produced through fermentation (for alcohols like ethanol) and transesterification (for biodiesel).

Pair 1 is incorrect. Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis using renewable energy sources, not steam methane reforming. Steam methane reforming is a primary method for producing grey hydrogen which releases significant CO2. Pair 2 is incorrect. Grey hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbon sources like natural gas through steam methane reforming, and it is associated with significant CO2 emissions. Pair 3 is incorrect. Coalbed methane is extracted from coal seams, not directly from natural gas extraction.  The inclusion of incorrect pairings acts as distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances in energy production methods.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Key Property
1.  Diamond                     :   High Thermal Conductivity
2.  Graphite                    :   Lubricant properties
3.  Lithium                       :   High energy density (in batteries)
4.  Sodium                       :   Abundance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Diamonds are known for their exceptional thermal conductivity, making them useful in heat dissipation applications. Graphite exhibits lubricating properties due to its layered structure, allowing it to act as a solid lubricant. Lithium, in the context of batteries, is renowned for its high energy density, enabling the creation of lightweight and high-capacity batteries.  Finally, sodium is widely known for its abundance in the Earth's crust, making it a potentially cost-effective alternative to lithium in battery technology. The inclusion of all correct pairs tests the candidate's comprehensive knowledge of material properties.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type              Cation Used
1.  Lithium-ion battery       :   Sodium ions
2.  Sodium-ion battery      :   Lithium ions
3.  Sand Battery             :   Potassium ions
4.  Vanadium Flow Battery   :   Vanadium ions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Vanadium flow batteries utilize vanadium ions as their charge carriers.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Lithium-ion batteries use lithium ions (Li+), not sodium ions (Na+). Pair 2 is incorrect. Sodium-ion batteries utilize sodium ions (Na+), not lithium ions (Li+).  Pair 3 is incorrect. Sand batteries store thermal energy using the heat capacity of sand; they don't involve the use of ions like potassium.  These incorrect pairings are designed to test the candidate's detailed understanding of different battery technologies and their underlying mechanisms.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                   Application
1.  Acetylene                  :   Gas Welding
2.  Methane                     :   Gas Welding
3.  Ethylene                   :   Fruit Ripening
4.  LPG                         :   Cooking


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Acetylene is widely used in gas welding due to its high temperature flame. Ethylene is a plant hormone used to artificially ripen fruits. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) is commonly employed as a cooking fuel.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While methane is a flammable gas, it's not typically used in gas welding; acetylene is preferred for its higher flame temperature.  The inclusion of a partially correct pair (methane is a gas) acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's specific knowledge of fuel applications.


**6. With reference to materials and their properties, consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Characteristic Property
1.  Copper                       :   High corrosion resistance at temperatures below 150°C
2.  Tantalum                     :   High corrosion resistance at temperatures below 150°C
3.  Nickel                       :   Component of stainless steel
4.  Zinc                         :   Component of bronze


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Nickel is indeed a key component of stainless steel, contributing to its strength and corrosion resistance.  Zinc is a component of bronze, an alloy primarily composed of copper and tin, with zinc sometimes added for specific properties.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While copper does possess corrosion resistance, it's not as high as tantalum, especially at temperatures below 150°C.  Pair 2 is incorrect. Tantalum is correctly paired with high corrosion resistance but the temperature limit is wrong.  This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar properties of different materials and their applications.


**7. With reference to renewable and non-renewable resources, consider the following pairs:**

    Resource                    Classification
1.  Solar Energy                :   Non-renewable
2. Coal                         :   Non-renewable
3. Water                        :   Renewable (with caveats)
4. Fisheries                    :   Renewable (with caveats)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Coal is a non-renewable fossil fuel. Water is a renewable resource, but its renewability is dependent on sustainable management practices and conservation efforts. Similarly, fisheries are renewable resources, but overfishing and habitat destruction can severely impact their sustainability.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Solar energy is a renewable resource, derived from the sun's radiation and constantly replenished. This question tests the candidate's understanding of resource classification and the complexities of resource sustainability.


**8. With reference to the chemical composition of materials, consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Chemical Composition
1.  LPG                          :   Propane and Butane
2.  Biodiesel                   :   Fatty acids and glycerol
3.  Methanol                    :   CH3OH
4.  Ethylene                    :   C2H4


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) primarily consists of propane and butane. Biodiesel is produced through the transesterification of oils or fats, resulting in a mixture of fatty acids and glycerol. Methanol's chemical formula is CH3OH.  Ethylene's chemical formula is C2H4. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of chemical formulas and compositions of common substances.


**9. With reference to the applications of various materials, consider the following pairs:**

    Material                       Application
1. Graphite                       :   Pencil Lead
2. Lithium                        :   Mobile Phone Batteries
3.  Vanadium                     :   Vanadium Flow Batteries
4.  Copper                        :   Electrical Wiring


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Graphite is a key component of pencil lead. Lithium is a crucial element in mobile phone batteries due to its high energy density. Vanadium is utilized in vanadium flow batteries for energy storage. Copper is extensively used in electrical wiring owing to its high electrical conductivity.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the practical applications of materials based on their properties.


**10. With reference to environmental issues and pollutants, consider the following pairs:**

   Pollutant                     Environmental Impact
1.  Sulphur Dioxide              :   Acid Rain
2.  Carbon Dioxide               :   Global Warming
3.  Methane                      :   Global Warming
4.  Ethylene                     :   Ozone Depletion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Sulphur dioxide is a major contributor to acid rain. Carbon dioxide is a primary greenhouse gas causing global warming. Methane is another potent greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.

Pair 4 is incorrect.  While ethylene has some environmental impacts, its primary effect is not ozone depletion.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the diverse environmental impacts of various pollutants.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Entity             Associated Molecule/Process
1.  Ribosomes                     :   Protein synthesis
2.  Mitochondria                 :   Cellular respiration
3.  Lysosomes                    :    DNA replication
4.  Golgi apparatus              :    Protein modification
5.  Nucleus                       :    RNA transcription

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ribosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, translating the genetic code from mRNA into polypeptide chains.  Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, carrying out cellular respiration to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's primary energy currency. The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins synthesized by ribosomes, preparing them for transport to their final destinations within or outside the cell. The nucleus houses the cell's DNA and is the site of RNA transcription, where the genetic information in DNA is copied into RNA molecules.  Lysosomes, however, are involved in waste breakdown and recycling within the cell, not DNA replication. DNA replication occurs in the nucleus. Therefore, options 1, 2, 4 and 5 are correctly matched. Option (c) is the only option correctly representing this.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vitamin                      Associated Element
1. Vitamin B12                  :   Cobalt
2. Vitamin K                    :    Iron
3. Vitamin D                    :    Calcium
4. Vitamin C                    :    Magnesium
5. Vitamin A                    :    Phosphorus

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) contains cobalt as a central atom in its structure. Vitamin D's synthesis and function are closely linked to calcium metabolism, playing a crucial role in calcium absorption and bone health.  The other pairings are incorrect. Vitamin K is involved in blood clotting, but its structure does not inherently involve iron. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and has no direct association with magnesium. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin crucial for vision and growth, and it does not contain phosphorus. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                       Affected Organ/System
1.  Sickle Cell Anemia          :    Nervous System
2.  Hepatitis C                  :    Liver
3.  Tuberculosis                 :    Lungs
4.  Meningitis                   :    Brain and Spinal Cord
5.  Diabetes Mellitus            :    Pancreas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Hepatitis C primarily affects the liver, causing inflammation and potential liver damage. Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs, although it can spread to other organs. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.  While diabetes mellitus impacts the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency or resistance, the primary dysfunction is in the body's ability to regulate blood glucose, not solely within the pancreas itself. Sickle cell anemia affects the circulatory system, and while it can indirectly affect the nervous system via reduced oxygen supply, its primary effect is on red blood cells and blood flow.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 show a direct and primary organ/system affected by the disease.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetic Material Component    Role/Function
1.  Histones                     :   DNA Replication
2.  Nucleotides                  :   Building blocks of DNA
3.  mRNA                         :   Protein synthesis
4.  tRNA                         :   Transcription
5.  rRNA                         :   Ribosomal structure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Nucleotides are the fundamental building blocks of DNA and RNA, forming the chains of these nucleic acids.  mRNA (messenger RNA) carries the genetic code from DNA to ribosomes, where it directs protein synthesis. rRNA (ribosomal RNA) is a structural component of ribosomes, essential for their function in protein synthesis. Histones, however, are proteins that organize and package DNA, not directly involved in DNA replication itself; DNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for DNA replication. tRNA (transfer RNA) carries amino acids to ribosomes during translation, not involved in transcription (the process of creating RNA from DNA).  Therefore, options 2, 3 and 5 are correctly matched.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune System Component      Primary Function
1.  B cells                      :   Cell-mediated immunity
2.  T cells                      :   Humoral immunity
3.  Macrophages                 :   Antigen presentation
4.  Dendritic cells              :   Phagocytosis
5.  Natural Killer cells          :   Direct cell killing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that engulf pathogens and present their antigens to T cells, initiating an adaptive immune response. Dendritic cells are also APCs, but their primary function is antigen presentation, not phagocytosis (though they can perform phagocytosis). Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that directly kill infected or cancerous cells without prior sensitization. B cells are responsible for humoral immunity (antibody-mediated immunity), while T cells are primarily involved in cell-mediated immunity.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  The other pairs incorrectly attribute primary functions.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     |   Primary Use/Source
1. Graphite                     |   Component of Lithium-ion Batteries
2. Bagasse                      |   Raw Material for Paper Production
3. Vanadium                    |   Alloying element in Steel
4. Red Mud                      | Source of Rare Earth Elements

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Graphite is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, serving as an anode material due to its excellent electrical conductivity and ability to intercalate lithium ions.  Bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane processing, is extensively used in paper production as a source of cellulose fibers. Vanadium is indeed used as an alloying element in steel, enhancing its strength and other properties.  Finally, red mud, a waste product of aluminum production, contains significant amounts of rare earth elements (REEs), making it a potential source for their extraction.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mineral/Material          |   Geographical Location/Source
1.  Graphite                  |   Odisha, India
2.  Vanadium                  |   Gulf of Khambhat, India
3.  Rare Earth Elements (REEs) |   Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, India
4.  Bagasse                   |   Sugarcane fields globally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India possesses significant graphite reserves, with Odisha being a notable producing state.  The Geological Survey of India has discovered vanadium deposits in the Gulf of Khambhat, Gujarat.  The National Geophysical Research Institute has confirmed substantial REE deposits in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh. While bagasse is derived from sugarcane, the statement "Sugarcane fields globally" is too broad.  Bagasse production is linked to sugarcane cultivation, but it's not accurate to say it originates from all sugarcane fields globally. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not encompass all the correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to industrial byproducts and their uses, consider the following pairs:**

   Byproduct                   |    Application
1. Bagasse                     |    Biomass fuel
2. Red Mud                     |    Source of titanium
3.  Waste from Sugarcane       |    Production of ethanol

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bagasse, the fibrous residue left after sugarcane juice extraction, finds application as a biomass fuel, providing a renewable energy source. Red mud, a byproduct of alumina refining, contains titanium and other valuable metals, making it a potential source for titanium extraction.  Sugarcane waste, which includes bagasse and other residues, can be utilized in the production of bioethanol, a biofuel.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect, as they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     |    Characteristic/Property
1.  Graphite                   |   Allotrope of carbon
2.  Diamond                    |   High thermal conductivity
3.  Vanadium                   |    Transition metal
4.  Superconductor             |   Zero resistance below critical temperature


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Graphite is an allotrope of carbon, meaning it's a different structural form of the same element. Diamond, known for its hardness, also exhibits very high thermal conductivity. Vanadium is classified as a transition metal in the periodic table. Superconductors, by definition, exhibit zero electrical resistance below a specific critical temperature.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these correct pairings.


**5. With reference to the applications of materials, consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     |    Specific Application
1.  Perovskite                  |   Solar cells
2.  Graphite                   |   Pencil lead
3.  Vanadium                    |    Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFBs)
4.  Lab-grown diamonds        |   Industrial cutting tools


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Perovskite materials are used in high-efficiency solar cells due to their tunable optical and electronic properties. Graphite is a key component of pencil lead. Vanadium is a crucial element in Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFBs), which are used for energy storage.  Lab-grown diamonds, possessing exceptional hardness, find extensive use as industrial cutting tools.  Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound          Use/Property
1. Ethanol                     :   Increases octane number of petrol
2. Methanol                    :   Used in synthetic dyestuffs
3. Tetraethyl lead             :   Added to petrol to increase octane number
4. Ethylene Dibromide         :   Substitute for tetraethyl lead in petrol
5. Liquid Nitrogen             :   Used for cryotherapy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Methanol is indeed used in the production of synthetic dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes.  Liquid nitrogen, due to its extremely low temperature (-196°C), finds application in cryotherapy (freezing tissue) and the preservation of biological samples. Tetraethyl lead was historically added to petrol to increase its octane rating, improving engine performance; however, due to its severe environmental toxicity, its use has been largely phased out.  Ethylene dibromide served as a lead scavenger in leaded gasoline, helping to remove lead deposits from engines.  Ethanol, while a fuel additive, does *not* significantly increase the octane number of petrol; it's primarily used to boost octane rating and reduce emissions. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 4 are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the described uses of Ethanol and Ethylene Dibromide.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element          Occurrence/Property
1. Iron                       :   Most abundant element in Earth's crust
2. Oxygen                     :   Essential for combustion
3. Nitrogen                   :   Major constituent of the atmosphere
4. Sulphur                    :   Reacts with iron to form iron sulphide
5. Calcium                    :   Found in limestone


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Oxygen is crucial for combustion, a chemical process that releases energy. Nitrogen is a primary component of Earth's atmosphere, making up about 78% of its volume.  Sulphur readily reacts with iron, forming iron sulphide, a process often contributing to corrosion. Calcium is a significant constituent of limestone, a sedimentary rock. However, while iron is a very abundant element, it is not the *most* abundant in the Earth's crust; that distinction belongs to oxygen. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  Option (d) is incorrect because pair 1 is factually inaccurate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Food Type                 Nutrient Richness
1. Pulses                     :   Rich source of carbohydrates
2. Milk                       :   Rich source of Vitamin A
3. Cereals                    :   Poor source of proteins
4. Vegetables                 :   Rich source of minerals
5. Mushrooms                 :   Rich source of proteins


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Milk is a good source of Vitamin A. Vegetables are rich in various minerals. Mushrooms are a notable source of protein.  However, pulses are primarily known for their high protein content, not carbohydrates. Cereals are rich in carbohydrates, not particularly poor in proteins, although their protein content is lower compared to pulses or legumes. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Plant Structure           Function
1. Stomata                    :   Responsible for transpiration
2. Xylem                      :   Transports water and minerals
3. Root                       :   Anchors the plant
4. Chloroplast                :   Site of photosynthesis
5. Cell membrane              :   Outermost layer of plant cell


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Stomata are tiny pores on leaves that regulate gas exchange and are primarily responsible for transpiration (water loss). Xylem is the vascular tissue that efficiently transports water and minerals throughout the plant. Roots anchor the plant to the ground and absorb water and nutrients. Chloroplasts are the organelles within plant cells where photosynthesis takes place. However, the cell membrane is not the outermost layer in all plant cells; the cell wall is the outermost layer.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include pair 5, which is not fully accurate.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Property of Fats           Description
1. Formation of cell membranes:  Fats are a major component
2. Calcium absorption         :   Fats aid in this process
3. Tissue repair              :   Fats contribute to this process
4. Energy release             :   Slower than carbohydrates
5. Source of essential fatty acids :  Fats provide these


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fats are essential structural components of cell membranes.  Dietary fats aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K, and indirectly influence calcium absorption. Fats play a role in tissue repair and regeneration.  The body metabolizes fats to release energy, but this process is generally slower than the breakdown of carbohydrates for immediate energy needs. Fats also supply essential fatty acids, which the body cannot synthesize.  Therefore, all five pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                    Characteristic/Use
1. Petrol                        :   Calorific value of 45000 kJ/kg
2. CNG                           :   Cheaper than petrol
3. Ethanol                       :   Blended with petrol as a biofuel
4. Methanol                      :   Alternative fuel to petrol
5. Tetraethyl lead               :   Added to petrol


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Petrol possesses a calorific value approximately around 45000 kJ/kg. CNG is generally cheaper than petrol. Ethanol is increasingly blended with petrol as a biofuel, aiming to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and lower emissions. Methanol is explored as an alternative fuel source.  Tetraethyl lead was historically added to enhance petrol's octane rating but is now largely phased out due to its toxicity.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer. Other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one accurately matched pair.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geological Feature        Characteristic
1. Aquifers                    :   Found in Ganga basin
2. Granite                     :   Composed primarily of silica and aluminum
3. Sandy soil                  :   Parent material is granite
4. Archaean Gneisses         :   Similar to granite in composition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aquifers, underground water-bearing layers, are indeed found within the Ganga basin. Granite is predominantly composed of silica and aluminum silicate minerals.  Sandy soils frequently originate from the weathering and erosion of granite. Archaean Gneisses are metamorphic rocks sharing significant compositional similarities with granite. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one accurately matched pair.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on factual recall and analysis.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element          Associated Geological Formation
1. Aluminium                 :  Bauxite
2. Phosphorus                :  Gondwana Coal
3. Magnesium                 :  Olivine
4. Calcium                    : Phosphate Rocks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum.  Gondwana coal deposits contain significant amounts of phosphorus. Olivine is a magnesium-iron silicate mineral.  While calcium is found in phosphate rocks, the primary association is not as direct or exclusive as the other pairs.  Phosphate rocks are sedimentary rocks containing significant amounts of phosphate minerals, which are compounds of calcium, phosphorus, and oxygen. However, many other minerals also contain calcium. Therefore, option (a) is the most accurate representation of the direct and primary geological associations. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of magnesium and olivine. Option (c) is also incorrect as it incorrectly includes the less direct link between calcium and phosphate rocks, while omitting the correct pairing of aluminum with bauxite and phosphorus with Gondwana coal. Option (d) is incorrect due to the less direct and less exclusive link between calcium and phosphate rocks.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nutrient                      Role/Source
1. Boron (B)                   : Affects Calcium Uptake in Plants
2. Calcium                     : Abundant in Unpolished Rice
3. Phosphorus                  : Essential for Nodulation by Rhizobium
4. Magnesium                  :  Component of Pyroxene


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Boron does influence the uptake of calcium in plants, impacting plant growth and development. Calcium is a significant component of unpolished rice, contributing to its nutritional value. Phosphorus plays a crucial role in the process of nodulation by Rhizobium bacteria in leguminous plants, which is essential for nitrogen fixation. Magnesium is a constituent element of several minerals, including pyroxene.  All four pairs accurately represent established relationships between the nutrients and their roles or sources.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.  There are no incorrect pairings or misleading distractors in this question; all options are factually sound.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Element                       Abundance/Location
1. Aluminium                   : Most abundant element in Earth's crust
2. Calcium                      : High concentration in Desert Soils
3. Phosphorus                   : Found in Manures
4. Magnesium                   :  Component of Kyanite


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4



**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Aluminum is indeed the most abundant metal and one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Desert soils are often characterized by high calcium concentrations due to weathering processes. Manures, being organic materials derived from plant and animal sources, naturally contain phosphorus.  However, magnesium is not a primary component of kyanite; aluminum is. Therefore, option (a) correctly identifies the three accurately matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) include the inaccurate pairing of magnesium and kyanite, making them incorrect.



**4. With reference to macronutrients and micronutrients, consider the following pairs:**

   Nutrient Type               Example Nutrient
1. Micronutrients             :  Manganese
2. Micronutrients             :  Chlorine
3. Macronutrients             :  Magnesium
4. Macronutrients             :  Copper


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Manganese and chlorine are indeed micronutrients, required by plants in trace amounts. Magnesium is a macronutrient, essential for plant growth in larger quantities. However, copper is also a micronutrient, not a macronutrient. Therefore, only three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include copper as a macronutrient, rendering them incorrect.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Biological Molecule       Action/Effect

2. GLP-1                     : Decreases glucagon production
3. Insulin                    :  Decreases blood sugar levels
4.  Amylase                   : Breaks down starch


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) counteracts glucagon's effect by reducing its production and promoting insulin release, thereby lowering blood sugar. Insulin is the primary hormone responsible for lowering blood glucose levels. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars.  All four pairs are correctly matched, reflecting accurate biological functions.  There are no incorrect pairings to act as distractors in this question.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ethanol is indeed used as a racing engine fuel, offering a performance-enhancing and environmentally-friendly alternative in certain contexts.  Methanol is a component in some hand sanitizers, though its use is increasingly regulated due to toxicity concerns.  However, potato chips are flushed with nitrogen, not carbon dioxide, to prevent rancidity. Carbon dioxide is used in other food preservation methods but not primarily for this purpose in potato chips.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of carbon dioxide as a distractor plays on the common knowledge of its use in food preservation, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of specific applications.


**2. With reference to biofuels, consider the following pairs:**

   Biofuel Source                     Biofuel Type

2. Sugarcane                            :  Biodiesel
3. Cellulosic matter                   :  Methanol

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Molasses is a significant feedstock for ethanol production through fermentation.  Sugarcane is a primary source of ethanol, not biodiesel. Biodiesel is typically derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Cellulosic matter can be used to produce ethanol, not methanol, through advanced biofuel processing technologies.  Thus, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The other options present plausible but incorrect pairings, testing both knowledge of biofuel sources and the specific biofuels derived from them.


**3. With reference to the properties and uses of chemical compounds, consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                     Property/Use
1. Methanol                              :  Treatment for ethanol poisoning
2. Ethanol                               :  Reduction of CO2 emissions
3. Water                                 :  Used in Hydrogen production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ethanol is used as a treatment for methanol poisoning, not the other way around.  Ethanol's use in fuel blends contributes to reduced CO2 emissions compared to gasoline. Water is a crucial component in the electrolysis process used for hydrogen production. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The inclusion of the reversed poisoning treatment acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the specific chemical properties and their applications.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

3. Oxygen                               :  Used in denitrification

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Magnesium is a central component of chlorophyll molecules, essential for photosynthesis. Nitrogen is a crucial nutrient for plant growth, forming amino acids and proteins. Oxygen is *produced* during photosynthesis and is used by plants and other organisms in respiration, it's not directly used in denitrification (which is the conversion of nitrates into nitrogen gas by microorganisms).  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (d) includes a scientifically incorrect pairing, requiring careful evaluation of the roles of elements in biological processes.


**5. With reference to the uses of Magnesium, consider the following pairs:**

1. Sugarcane                           : Fermentation
2. Corn                                 : Distillation
3. Biowaste                             :  Chemical Synthesis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Ethanol is primarily produced from sugarcane through fermentation by yeast. While corn is also a source of ethanol, the process mainly involves fermentation, not solely distillation. Distillation is a purification step, not the primary production method. Biowaste can be converted to ethanol using various processes, but these often involve bio-processing methods like anaerobic digestion followed by fermentation, not direct chemical synthesis. Thus, only pair 1 is correct, highlighting the nuances of ethanol production from different sources.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                    Production Source
1. Methanol                             : Natural Gas
2. Ethanol                              :  Sugar Beet
3. Biodiesel                            : Vegetable Oils

2. **Barium and Fireworks:** Barium compounds are indeed used in fireworks to produce a bright green color.  This is a well-known application. However, the question attempts to mislead by associating it with a different element's application in fireworks. Therefore, this pair is incorrect.

3. **Nitrogen and CFL bulbs:**  Nitrogen is used in CFL bulbs, but not as a primary component that defines its functionality. CFLs primarily contain mercury vapor and phosphors. The nitrogen acts as a fill gas, but the question intends to distract by associating it with the function of the bulb rather than its use as a relatively minor component.  Thus, this pair is incorrect.

All three pairs are incorrectly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of the applications of elements and avoids superficial associations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Process       Associated Compound/Element

3. Mitochondria                       :   Location of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Bacteria utilize chemosynthesis, a process where energy is obtained from chemical reactions rather than sunlight, as a metabolic pathway.  Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they require a host cell to replicate, and humans are a common host for many viruses.  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is exclusively located within the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect established biological knowledge.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Group/Agent         Associated Feature/Action
1. Fungi                            :   Decomposition of organic material
2. Bacteria                          :   Nitrogen fixation
3. Bacteria                          :   Production of enzymes for decomposition

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately represent the roles and characteristics of fungi and bacteria in ecological processes. Fungi are well-known decomposers, breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients back into the ecosystem. Bacteria play a crucial role in nitrogen fixation, converting atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by plants.  Bacteria also produce various enzymes that facilitate the decomposition of complex organic molecules. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Component       Associated Function/Location
1. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum: Protein synthesis in mammalian cells
2. Cell Membrane             :   Protein synthesis in mammalian cells
3. Vacuoles full of cell sap  :   Turgidity and rigidity in plant cells

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is studded with ribosomes, the sites of protein synthesis. Therefore, the RER is the primary location for protein synthesis in mammalian cells.  Vacuoles filled with cell sap maintain turgor pressure, providing structural support and rigidity to plant cells.  Protein synthesis does *not* occur in the cell membrane. The cell membrane's function is primarily to regulate the passage of substances into and out of the cell. Option (a) is incorrect as it excludes the correct pairing of vacuoles and their function. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect association of protein synthesis with the cell membrane. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly includes the cell membrane in protein synthesis.


**4. With reference to the impact of atmospheric pressure, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                          Effect
1.  Decreased atmospheric pressure : Lowered boiling point of liquids
2. Increased atmospheric pressure  : Increased boiling point of liquids
3. Height increase                 : Decreased atmospheric pressure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Lowering atmospheric pressure reduces the force required for a liquid to transition to a gaseous state (boiling), thus lowering the boiling point. Conversely, increased atmospheric pressure raises the boiling point.  Atmospheric pressure decreases as altitude (height) increases due to the reduced density of air at higher elevations. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one of these established physical relationships.



**5. With reference to  bacteria and viruses, consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic              Presence in Bacteria/Viruses
1. Cytoplasm                   :   Present in bacteria, absent in viruses
2. Cell membrane               :   Present in bacteria, absent in viruses
3. Mitochondria                 :   Present in bacteria, absent in viruses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bacteria are prokaryotic cells possessing cytoplasm but lacking membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria. Viruses are acellular, lacking both cytoplasm and a cell membrane; they are essentially genetic material encased in a protein coat.  Therefore, all three pairs correctly reflect the fundamental differences in cellular structure between bacteria and viruses. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one accurately matched pair.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biomolecule                     Cellular Location of Synthesis
1. Insulin                          :   Pancreatic Islet Cells
2. Hemoglobin                     :   Bone Marrow
3.  Proteins of Chloroplast       :   Chloroplast

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Insulin, a protein hormone crucial for glucose regulation, is synthesized by the specialized islet cells within the pancreas.  These beta cells are responsible for producing and releasing insulin into the bloodstream. Option 1 is thus correct.

Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells, is synthesized within the bone marrow. This is where red blood cells are produced through a process called hematopoiesis. The ribosomes in the erythroid precursor cells within the bone marrow actively translate mRNA into hemoglobin polypeptide chains, which then assemble into the functional tetrameric protein. Therefore, option 2 is also correct.

Proteins found within chloroplasts, the organelles responsible for photosynthesis in plant cells, are synthesized within the chloroplast itself. Chloroplasts possess their own genetic material (cpDNA) and translation machinery, enabling them to produce many of the proteins they require for their function, including those involved in the light-dependent and light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. This makes option 3 correct as well.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Macromolecule                Process Involved
1.  mRNA                         :   Photosynthesis
2.  Proteins                      :   Muscle Contraction
3.  Starch                        :   Digestion by Amylase

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

mRNA (messenger RNA) is not directly involved in photosynthesis. Photosynthesis utilizes chlorophylls and other pigments to capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates.  While gene expression involving mRNA is necessary for producing the proteins involved in photosynthesis, mRNA itself is not a direct reactant or product of the photosynthetic process. Thus, option 1 is incorrect.

Proteins are fundamental to muscle contraction.  The interaction of actin and myosin filaments, driven by ATP hydrolysis and regulated by calcium ions released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is the basis of muscle contraction.  Many proteins are crucial to this process, making option 2 correct.

Starch, a polysaccharide, is digested by amylase enzymes. Amylase, found in saliva and pancreatic juice, breaks down starch into smaller sugars like maltose. This is a key step in carbohydrate digestion. Therefore, option 3 is correct. Thus only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nutrient Source                 Nutrient
1. Mushrooms                      :   Lipids
2. A1 Milk                         :   Proteins
3.  Potato                          :   Starch

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mushrooms are not primarily known as a rich source of lipids (fats). While they contain some fats, they are more significant for their protein and carbohydrate content. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.

A1 milk contains proteins, including casein proteins.  The specific type of casein in A1 milk has been linked to some digestive issues in certain individuals, but its primary component remains protein.  Option 2 is therefore correct.

Potatoes are a significant source of starch, a polysaccharide serving as a storage carbohydrate in plants.  Therefore, option 3 is correct. Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organelle                         Function
1. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum :   Protein Synthesis
2. Golgi Apparatus                :   Photosynthesis
3.  Cell Membrane                 :   Ion Transport

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is studded with ribosomes, the sites of protein synthesis.  Ribosomes translate mRNA into polypeptide chains, which then undergo folding and modification within the RER lumen.  Therefore, option 1 is correct.

The Golgi apparatus is involved in protein processing, modification, sorting, and packaging, not photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is primarily carried out by chloroplasts in plant cells.  Therefore, option 2 is incorrect.

The cell membrane plays a vital role in regulating the transport of ions and small molecules across the cell boundary. This transport can be passive (diffusion) or active (requiring energy), depending on the concentration gradient and the type of molecule. Therefore, option 3 is correct.  Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Blood Component                 Quantity
1. Red Blood Cells                 :   Lowest in Number
2. White Blood Cells                :   More than Platelets
3. Platelets                       :   More than Red Blood Cells

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The statement that red blood cells are the lowest in number is incorrect. Red blood cells are the most numerous blood cells.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.

White blood cells are indeed more numerous than platelets.  Therefore, option 2 is correct.

The statement that platelets are more numerous than red blood cells is incorrect; red blood cells are far more abundant. Therefore, option 3 is incorrect. Only pair 2 is correctly matched, but the question asks for correctly matched pairs.  Therefore the correct answer is (c).


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Process                         Involved Molecule
1. Photosynthesis                 :   Oxygen for carbohydrate synthesis
2. Digestion of Fat                :   Lipases
3.  Digestion of Nucleic Acids    :   Amylases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Plants use carbon dioxide, not oxygen, to synthesize carbohydrates during photosynthesis. Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.

Lipases are enzymes that break down fats (lipids) during digestion. This is a crucial step in lipid metabolism.  Therefore, option 2 is correct.

Amylases digest carbohydrates, not nucleic acids.  Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are broken down by nucleases. Therefore, option 3 is incorrect. Only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Hormone                           Characteristic
1. Insulin                          :   Steroid Hormone
2. Glucagon                        :   Produced in the Pancreas
3.  GLP-1                           :  Increases Insulin Production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Insulin is a protein hormone, not a steroid hormone. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.

Glucagon, another hormone involved in glucose regulation, is indeed produced in the pancreas by alpha cells. Therefore, option 2 is correct.

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) stimulates insulin release and increases insulin production.  Therefore, option 3 is correct.  Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Phenomenon                      Characteristic
1. Light                            :   Travels faster in vacuum than in water
2. Earth's magnetic field          :   Influences bird migration patterns
3. Sunlight                         :   Essential for phytoplankton photosynthesis
4.  CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections) :   Originate from the Sun's corona


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Light indeed travels faster in a vacuum than in a denser medium like water. This is a fundamental principle of optics.  The refractive index of water is greater than 1, indicating that light slows down when it passes from a vacuum to water.  Option 1 is therefore correct.

Earth's magnetic field significantly influences bird migration. Many bird species possess a biological compass that allows them to sense and utilize the Earth's magnetic field for navigation during their long-distance migrations. This is a well-established fact in ornithology and biophysics. Option 2 is correct.

Sunlight is crucial for photosynthesis in phytoplankton, the microscopic plants that form the base of many aquatic food webs. Phytoplankton use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic matter, releasing oxygen in the process. This is a cornerstone of aquatic ecology. Option 3 is correct.

CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections) are powerful eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's corona. They are not simply embedded within a magnetic field; they *are* massive expulsions of plasma and magnetic field themselves.  While they are associated with the Sun's magnetic field, the phrasing of the pair is inaccurate. Option 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Celestial Body                 Property
1. Jupiter                         :   Possesses a strong magnetic field
2. Uranus                          :   Has a tilted magnetic axis
3. Neptune                         :   Exhibits magnetic field lines unlike Earth's


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Jupiter is known for its incredibly strong magnetic field, far exceeding that of Earth. This field is generated by the planet's rapid rotation and its metallic hydrogen interior. Option 1 is correct.

Uranus's magnetic field is unique because it is significantly tilted relative to its rotational axis. This unusual orientation is not fully understood but is likely related to the planet's internal dynamics. Option 2 is correct.

Neptune also possesses a magnetic field, but its configuration differs significantly from Earth's dipole field. The field is offset from the planet's center and tilted considerably, suggesting a complex internal structure and magnetic generation process. Option 3 is correct.  All three pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Phenomenon                     Effect/Location
1. Sunlight penetration          :    Greater in water than on land
2. Magnetic striping              :   Evidence of plate tectonics
3. Magnetic equator               :   Region of zero magnetic field


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Sunlight penetrates deeper into water than it does into land. Water is more transparent to sunlight than land surfaces, which absorb and scatter light more readily. This difference is crucial for marine ecosystems and the distribution of marine life. Option 1 is correct.

Magnetic striping on the ocean floor is a direct result of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. As new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, it records the Earth's magnetic field at the time of formation.  The alternating bands of normal and reversed polarity provide strong evidence for plate movement and the reversal of Earth's magnetic field over geological time. Option 2 is correct.

The magnetic equator is not a region of zero magnetic field.  It's the line on the Earth's surface where the magnetic field is purely horizontal; the dip angle is zero.  The statement in Option 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, only 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Wave Type                     Property
1. Sound wave                    :   Cannot travel through a vacuum
2. Electromagnetic wave          :   Can travel through a vacuum
3. Transverse electromagnetic wave:   Characterizes visible light


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Sound waves are mechanical waves, requiring a medium (like air, water, or solids) to propagate. They cannot travel through a vacuum, which lacks a medium for the vibrations to transfer. Option 1 is correct.

Electromagnetic waves, on the other hand, do not require a medium to travel. They can propagate through a vacuum, as demonstrated by sunlight reaching Earth. Option 2 is correct.

Visible light is a type of electromagnetic wave, and it is specifically a transverse wave, meaning the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Option 3 is correct. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Phenomenon                  Description
1. Rainbow                       :   Appears due to refraction and reflection of sunlight in water droplets
2. Secondary rainbow              :   Less intense than the primary rainbow, appearing approximately 10° away
3.  Magnetic field around a wire :   Causes deflection of a nearby compass needle


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Rainbows are formed by the refraction and reflection of sunlight within water droplets in the atmosphere.  The different wavelengths of light are refracted at different angles, leading to the separation of colors. Option 1 is correct.

A secondary rainbow forms due to a double reflection of sunlight within water droplets. This results in a fainter, less intense arc appearing outside the primary rainbow, typically about 10° away. Option 2 is correct.

A current-carrying wire generates a magnetic field around it. This magnetic field interacts with the magnetic needle of a compass, causing it to deflect. This is a fundamental principle of electromagnetism. Option 3 is correct.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of Earth's Magnetic Field                 Observed Location/Phenomenon
1.  Reverse Polarity                               :   Mid-ocean ridges
2.  Normal Polarity                                :   South Africa
3.  Weakened Field during a Geological Period     :   Ediacaran period
4.  Magnetic Pole Reversal                         :   Brazil

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The correct pairs are 1 and 3.  Mid-ocean ridges exhibit evidence of past magnetic pole reversals, recording the Earth's magnetic field's history, including periods of reverse polarity where the magnetic north and south poles were switched.  The Ediacaran period is known for a significant weakening of the Earth's magnetic field.

Option 2 is incorrect because while South Africa is a location where research on the Earth's magnetic field is conducted,  it doesn't exclusively represent areas with normal polarity. Normal polarity is a global phenomenon, not confined to a specific geographical location.  The Earth's magnetic field exhibits both normal and reversed polarity globally over geological time.

Option 4 is incorrect because while magnetic pole reversals are a real phenomenon, associating them specifically with Brazil is inaccurate.  Pole reversals are a global event, not localized to a single country.  Research on the Earth's magnetic field is conducted in many countries, including Brazil, but that does not mean that the reversal itself is confined to that country.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Earth's Magnetic Field Phenomenon               Related Process/Event
1.  Geomagnetic Reversal                           :   Convection currents in the outer core
2.  Magnetosphere creation                        :   Convection
3.  Shielding from Solar Wind                     :   Geomagnetic reversal
4.  Protection of Earth's Atmosphere              :   Ring current


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Geomagnetic reversals are a consequence of the chaotic nature of convection currents within the Earth's outer core, which generates the magnetic field. The magnetosphere is formed by the interaction of the Earth's magnetic field with the solar wind. This is caused by convection processes within the Earth's core. The Earth's magnetic field protects the atmosphere by deflecting the charged particles of the solar wind.  The ring current, a torus of electric current surrounding the Earth, contributes to this protection.

Option 3 is incorrect. While the Earth's magnetic field shields the planet from the solar wind, geomagnetic reversals themselves are not directly involved in the shielding process. The shielding is a continuous process, even during periods of reversed polarity.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of Earth's Magnetic Field                  Related Feature/Concept
1.  Magnetic Poles                                 :   Magnetic declination
2.  Magnetosphere                                :   Van Allen radiation belt
3.  Paleomagnetism                               :   Magnetic minerals
4.  South Magnetic Pole                          :   Compass


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Earth's magnetic field has magnetic poles, whose locations are relevant to magnetic declination (the angle between true north and magnetic north). The magnetosphere, a region defined by the Earth's magnetic field, traps charged particles in the Van Allen radiation belts. Paleomagnetism, the study of the ancient magnetic field, relies on the alignment of magnetic minerals in rocks and sediments.


Option 4 is incorrect. While a compass is influenced by the Earth's magnetic field, it is not specifically linked to the South Magnetic Pole. The compass needle points towards magnetic north, which is geographically near the North Magnetic Pole.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Gravitational Wave Related Concept            Associated Fact/Entity
1.  Einstein's General Theory of Relativity      :   Prediction of Gravitational Waves
2.  Supermassive Black Holes                    :   Source of Low-Frequency Gravitational Waves
3.  Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) : Detection of Gravitational Waves
4.  Hubble Constant                             :   Calculation using Supernovae brightness


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Einstein's theory of General Relativity predicted the existence of gravitational waves. Supermassive black holes, through their mergers and interactions, are a significant source of low-frequency gravitational waves.  LIGO is a crucial instrument for detecting gravitational waves.

Option 4 is incorrect. While the Hubble constant can be refined using data from gravitational waves, its primary calculation method involves comparing the observed brightness of supernovae with their redshift. Gravitational waves provide additional information and constraints but aren't the primary method.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept Related to Gravitational Waves        Associated Scientist/Instrument
1.  Nobel Prize in Physics                       :   LIGO
2.  Theory of General Relativity                  :    Albert Einstein
3.  Detection of Gravitational Waves             :   Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)
4.  Gravitational Lensing                       :   Einstein Cross


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded for the detection of gravitational waves, a discovery directly related to LIGO's work. Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity predicted the existence of gravitational waves. The Einstein Cross is a specific example of gravitational lensing.

Option 3 is incorrect. While the GMRT is a powerful radio telescope used in astrophysics, it is not primarily designed for detecting gravitational waves.  Gravitational waves are detected using interferometers like LIGO, which measure extremely minute changes in spacetime.

3. Iron                         :   Used extensively by Megalithic people
4. Lithium                     :    Deposits discovered in Jammu & Kashmir


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched based on the provided information.  Uranium is indeed found in crystalline rocks, alongside alluvial aquifers and granite, as mentioned in the target content. Cobalt does have major reserves in Australia,  as stated in the text.  The Megalithic culture's use of iron for tools and construction is well-documented historically.  Finally, the recent discovery of lithium deposits in Jammu and Kashmir is a significant development in India's access to this critical mineral for battery production. Therefore, all four pairs accurately reflect the factual information provided.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Use/Application
1. Uranium                     :  Nuclear fuel
2. Cobalt                      : Catalyst in Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs)
3. Iron                         : Component of Superalloys
4. Lithium                     : Anode material in Lithium-ion batteries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Uranium is a key component in nuclear fuel, a fact widely known in nuclear technology. Cobalt serves as a catalyst in DMFCs, a specific application mentioned in the provided data. Lithium is a crucial component in the anode of lithium-ion batteries, a cornerstone of modern battery technology. However, pair 3 is incorrect. While iron is a component in many alloys, it's not specifically mentioned as a component of superalloys in the given text.  Superalloys often incorporate other high-temperature resistant elements. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete and inaccurate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographic Location       Associated Mineral/Resource
1. Rajasthan                  : Uranium reserves
2. Congo (Kinshasa)          : Cobalt production
3. Jammu & Kashmir          : Lithium deposits
4. Chotanagpur Plateau      : Iron ore


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Rajasthan is known for its uranium reserves, a fact supported by the target content. Congo (Kinshasa) is a major producer of cobalt, as indicated in the text.  The discovery of lithium deposits in Jammu & Kashmir is recent news. The Chotanagpur Plateau is a well-known region for its iron ore deposits, aligning with the information provided.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one accurate pairing.


**4. With reference to Uranium, consider the following pairs:**

   Isotope                     Characteristic
1.  235U                       : Used in Nuclear Weapons
2.  238U                       :  Most abundant isotope
3. U-234                      : Decay product of Uranium


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Uranium-235 (235U) is fissile and is the primary isotope used in nuclear weapons due to its ability to sustain a chain reaction. Uranium-238 (238U) is the most abundant naturally occurring isotope of uranium. Pair 3 is incorrect; while U-234 is an isotope of uranium, it is a decay product of U-238, not of uranium generally.  The statement is too broad. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incomplete or contain inaccurate information.



**5. With reference to the distribution of minerals, consider the following pairs:**

   Mineral                     Location/Region
1. Cobalt                     : Katanga Plateau
2. Iron                       : Peninsular Plateau (India)
3. Uranium                   :  Northwestern states of India
4. Lithium                    :  Udaipur, Rajasthan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The Katanga Plateau is known for its cobalt deposits. The Peninsular Plateau in India is rich in iron ore.  Uranium reserves are found in the northwestern states of India. However, pair 4 is incorrect; while Rajasthan has mineral resources, the specific mention of Udaipur as a major lithium location is not supported by the provided text.  Option (d) is therefore incorrect because it includes this inaccurate pairing. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Associated Health Effect/Concern
1. Uranium                     : Kidney cancer
2. Methanol                    : Permanent blindness
3. Iron                         : Goiter in livestock (from high glucosinolate levels)
4.  Ethylene                   :  Cold burns


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Uranium exposure is linked to kidney cancer. Methanol poisoning can lead to permanent blindness. High glucosinolate levels in plants, particularly Indian mustard before gene editing, can cause goiter in livestock. Pair 4 is incorrect; cold burns are associated with exposure to extremely cold substances like liquid nitrogen, not ethylene. Ethylene is a gas used for artificial ripening of fruits. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete or contain at least one inaccurate pairing.


**7. With reference to energy sources, consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source               Characteristic/Advantage
1. Hydrogen                    : Non-greenhouse gas emitter
2. Biodiesel                   : Biodegradable and non-toxic
3. Sodium-ion battery          : High energy density
4. Sand battery                 : Used mainly for heating applications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Hydrogen combustion produces only water vapor, making it a non-greenhouse gas emitter. Biodiesel is indeed biodegradable and non-toxic. Sand batteries are primarily used for thermal energy storage, most often in heating systems. However, pair 3 is incorrect; while sodium-ion batteries offer advantages like lower cost and abundance of materials, they are not known for high energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries.  Their energy density is generally lower. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete or contain inaccurate information.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound             Role in Photosynthesis
1. Carbon Dioxide                 :   Final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain
2. Water                          :   Source of oxygen released during photosynthesis
3.  Glucose                        :   Product of the Calvin cycle
4.  ATP                           :   Provides energy for carbon fixation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because water serves as the source of oxygen released during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, and glucose is the primary carbohydrate produced during the Calvin cycle (carbon fixation).  The other options contain inaccuracies. Carbon dioxide is not the final electron acceptor; rather, NADP+ is the final electron acceptor in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. While ATP is crucial for the energy-requiring steps of photosynthesis, including carbon fixation, it isn't directly the *product* of a specific stage like glucose.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 accurately represent the roles of the specified chemical compounds in photosynthesis.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Process            Source of Carbon
1. Photosynthesis                 :   Atmospheric carbon dioxide
2. Respiration                     :   Organic molecules
3. Chemosynthesis                 :   Inorganic compounds like hydrogen sulfide
4. Fermentation                   :   Glucose

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Photosynthesis utilizes atmospheric carbon dioxide as its primary carbon source to synthesize organic molecules. Respiration breaks down organic molecules, releasing carbon dioxide. Chemosynthesis uses inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, as a source of energy and carbon for building organic matter in certain bacteria. Fermentation also uses glucose, a carbohydrate, as a starting material, involving carbon transformations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Metal           Primary Use in Preventing Corrosion
1. Zinc             :   Galvanizing steel structures
2. Tin              :   Coating brass utensils
3. Aluminum        :   Anodizing aluminum parts
4. Lead             :   Protecting iron pipes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Zinc is commonly used in galvanization, a process where a layer of zinc protects steel from rust. Tin is indeed used to coat brass utensils to prevent copper contamination, a form of corrosion prevention. Aluminum anodizing creates a protective oxide layer on aluminum, enhancing its corrosion resistance. However, lead is not a suitable or commonly used method for preventing corrosion in iron pipes due to its toxicity and environmental concerns.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material              Major Component
1. Brass                 :   Copper and Zinc
2. Bronze                :   Copper and Tin
3. Steel                  :   Iron and Carbon
4.  Stainless Steel       :   Iron, Chromium, and Nickel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately represent the major components of the materials listed. Brass is an alloy primarily composed of copper and zinc. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Steel is an alloy of iron with carbon as a significant constituent. Stainless steel is a type of steel that includes iron, chromium, and nickel to enhance its corrosion resistance and other properties.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sugar Type             Chemical Name
1. Glucose                 :   Fructose
2. Fructose                 :   Fruit sugar
3. Sucrose                  :   Table sugar
4. Lactose                  :   Milk sugar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only sucrose is correctly identified as table sugar, and lactose is accurately identified as milk sugar.  Glucose is a simple sugar, not fructose. While fructose is often called fruit sugar, it's not the *chemical name* of fructose. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound           Primary Source
1. Methane                    :   Biomass decomposition
2. Carbon Monoxide             :   Incomplete combustion of fuels
3. Hydrogen                    :   Electrolysis of water
4. Acetylene                   :   Calcium carbide reaction with water

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Methane is a product of anaerobic decomposition of organic matter (biomass). Carbon monoxide is formed during incomplete combustion processes. Hydrogen can be produced through the electrolysis of water. Acetylene is indeed generated when calcium carbide reacts with water.  Thus, all the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vitamin                  Primary Function
1. Vitamin A                 :   Blood clotting
2. Vitamin K                  :   Vision
3. Vitamin D                  :   Calcium absorption
4. Vitamin C                  :   Antioxidant

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption in the body. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.  The other pairings are incorrect. Vitamin K is crucial for blood clotting, not vitamin A. Vitamin A is important for vision, not vitamin K. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Plant Hormone           Primary Effect
1. Auxin                     :   Stimulates cell elongation
2. Gibberellin               :   Seed germination
3. Cytokinin                  :   Cell division
4. Abscisic Acid             :   Leaf abscission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Auxin primarily stimulates cell elongation in plants. Gibberellins play a key role in seed germination. Cytokinins promote cell division. However, abscisic acid is primarily involved in stress responses, dormancy, and stomatal closure, not leaf abscission (although it can play a role in the process).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Process                      Primary Product
1. Photosynthesis              :   Oxygen and glucose
2. Cellular Respiration        :   ATP and carbon dioxide
3. Fermentation                :   Ethanol and carbon dioxide (in some cases)
4. Nitrogen Fixation          :   Ammonia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Photosynthesis produces oxygen and glucose as primary products. Cellular respiration generates ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and carbon dioxide. Fermentation, depending on the type, produces various end products, including ethanol and carbon dioxide. Nitrogen fixation converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. All the pairs accurately reflect the primary products of these biological processes. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                 Primary Use
1.  Solar Energy                :   Generating electricity via photovoltaic cells
2.  Wind Energy                  :   Pumping water
3.  Hydroelectric Energy         :   Generating electricity via turbines
4.  Geothermal Energy           :   Heating buildings


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Solar energy is widely used to generate electricity using photovoltaic cells. Wind energy has been traditionally used for pumping water and is increasingly employed for electricity generation. Hydroelectric energy primarily generates electricity through turbines. Geothermal energy finds applications in direct heating of buildings and other uses.  Therefore, all four pairs accurately reflect common uses of these energy sources.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                     Property/Characteristic
1. CNG                           Primarily composed of methane
2. LPG                           Byproduct of petroleum refining
3. Biodiesel                      Derived from vegetable oils or animal fats
4. Hydrogen                       Produced through electrolysis of water


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) is predominantly methane (CH4). LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a byproduct of petroleum refining and natural gas processing. Biodiesel is indeed produced from renewable sources such as vegetable oils or animal fats. Finally, Hydrogen can be produced through the electrolysis of water, a process that uses electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.  These are all well-established facts in the fields of energy and chemistry.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs.  A complete understanding of alternative fuels and their production methods is necessary to answer this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type             Alternative Fuel Source
1. CNG                  Methanol
2. LPG                  Biodiesel
3. Hydrogen            Natural Gas
4. Biodiesel            Methane


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Methanol is being explored as an alternative fuel, and it can be used in blends with CNG.  Hydrogen is often produced from natural gas through processes like steam methane reforming. The other pairs are incorrect. While biodiesel can be an alternative to LPG in some applications, it is not a direct substitute or a source of LPG. Similarly, Biodiesel is not an alternative fuel source for methane, and vice-versa. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of alternative fuel sources and their interrelationships, requiring a nuanced understanding of energy production and consumption.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   City                     Characteristic/Association
1. Delhi                    Mandated use of CNG in public transport
2. Churu                    Higher average temperature compared to Shimla
3. Shimla                   Location of a significant historical conference (Wavell Plan)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Delhi is known for its policy mandating the use of CNG in public transport to reduce air pollution. Churu, located in Rajasthan, typically experiences significantly higher temperatures than Shimla, a hill station in Himachal Pradesh. The Wavell Plan, a significant proposal during the Indian independence movement, was indeed associated with discussions and meetings held in Shimla.  The question tests the candidate's geographical awareness, knowledge of environmental policies, and historical events.  All options excluding (c) are therefore incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound        Property/Use
1. Methanol                  Alternative fuel
2. Butane                     Component of LPG
3. Ethyl Mercaptan          Additive for leak detection in LPG
4. Methane                    Major component of CNG


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Methanol is explored as an alternative fuel source. Butane is a primary component of LPG. Ethyl mercaptan (also known as ethanethiol) is added to LPG to give it a distinctive odor, aiding in leak detection. Methane is the principal constituent of CNG.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of chemical compounds, their properties, and their applications in various industries, requiring familiarity with both chemistry and energy sectors.  Any option that omits a correctly matched pair is therefore wrong.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source          Characteristic/Application
1. LPG                     Reduces air pollution compared to some alternatives
2. CNG                     High calorific value (around 50,000 kJ/kg)
3. Hydrogen                 Used in the production of ammonia-based fertilizers
4. Biogas                  Composed of Methane


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), while still a fossil fuel, produces less air pollution than some other fossil fuels like coal. CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) possesses a high calorific value, making it an efficient fuel. Hydrogen is a crucial component in the Haber-Bosch process used for producing ammonia-based fertilizers.  Biogas, a renewable energy source, is largely composed of methane.  The question necessitates a comprehensive understanding of various energy sources, their properties, and their applications, integrating knowledge from multiple domains.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incorrect.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                  Process/Source
1. Carbon Dioxide                       Enhanced Weathering
2. Carbonic Acid                         Decomposition of organic matter
3. Methane                               Coal Combustion
4. Carbon Dioxide                       Ambient Air Capture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Enhanced weathering is a geological process that involves the reaction of silicate rocks with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, leading to the permanent sequestration of carbon.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Decomposition of organic matter, a biological process, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a byproduct. This makes pair 2 a correct match.  Ambient Air Capture is a technology designed specifically to remove carbon dioxide directly from the ambient air.  Pair 4 is thus correctly matched.  Coal combustion, however, primarily emits carbon dioxide, not methane (although methane is also a byproduct).  Methane is a greenhouse gas, but its primary source isn't coal combustion exclusively; it's also released from natural gas leaks, agricultural practices, and other sources. Thus, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.  The correct answer is (d) because pairs 1, 2, and 4 accurately link the chemical compound with its associated process or source.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material/Substance                   Related Process/Characteristic
1. Fossil Fuels                          Releases Carbon Dioxide
2. Shale Gas                             Composed of Carbon Dioxide
3. Carbon Dioxide                       Forms Carbonic Acid
4. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)         Lower global warming potential than Carbon Dioxide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The combustion of fossil fuels is a significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Carbon dioxide readily reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This makes pair 3 a correct match. Shale gas, while containing hydrocarbons, is not primarily composed of carbon dioxide.  Its main components are methane and ethane.  Pair 2 is therefore incorrect.  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have a significantly higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide, making pair 4 incorrect. The correct option is (a) as only pairs 1 and 3 represent accurate associations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geological Feature/Process           Carbon Dioxide Role
1. Continental Carbonate Stores         Transferred Carbon Dioxide
2. Martian Atmosphere                  Composed of Carbon Dioxide
3. Enhanced Weathering                  Removes Carbon Dioxide
4. Algae Assisted Fuel Cells (AFC)      Releases Carbon Dioxide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Continental carbonate stores represent significant reservoirs of carbon that have been transferred from the atmosphere over geological timescales. Pair 1 is correct. The Martian atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide. Pair 2 is also correct. Enhanced weathering is a process that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it in rocks. Pair 3 is correct. Algae Assisted Fuel Cells (AFC) capture carbon dioxide, not release it. Thus, pair 4 is incorrect.  The correct answer is (c) because pairs 1, 2, and 3 show accurate relationships between geological features/processes and the role of carbon dioxide.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Carbon Cycle Component                Associated Process
1. Carbon Cycle                          Involves Carbon Dioxide
2.  Decomposition of Organic Matter     Releases Carbon Dioxide
3. Coal Combustion                       Captures Carbon Dioxide
4.  Carbon Capture Technology          Removes Carbon Dioxide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The carbon cycle is a biogeochemical cycle that involves the cycling of carbon through various reservoirs, including the atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere. Carbon dioxide is a central component of this cycle. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Decomposition of organic matter releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Pair 2 is correct. Coal combustion is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, not a process that captures it. Pair 3 is incorrect. Carbon capture technologies are specifically designed to remove carbon dioxide from various sources. Pair 4 is correctly matched. The correct answer is (a) because pairs 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe the relationships between components of the carbon cycle and associated processes.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Greenhouse Gas                         Process/Effect
1. Carbon Dioxide                       Oxidizes to Methane
2. Methane                               Oxidizes to Carbon Dioxide
3. Carbon Dioxide                       Higher global warming potential than HFCs
4.  HFCs                                 Higher global warming potential than Carbon Dioxide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Methane (CH4) oxidizes in the atmosphere to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) possess a significantly higher global warming potential compared to carbon dioxide. This makes pair 4 correct. Carbon dioxide does not oxidize to methane; rather, the opposite is true. Pair 1 is incorrect. Carbon dioxide has a lower global warming potential than HFCs. Pair 3 is incorrect.  The correct answer is (a) since only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geological Formation                    Geological Epoch
1. Deccan Traps                           :  Miocene
2. Narmada-Tapi alluvial deposits        :  Pliocene
3. East African Rift (EAR)                :  Pleistocene
4. Continental carbonate stores           :  Holocene


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The Deccan Traps volcanic activity primarily occurred during the late Cretaceous to early Paleogene periods, largely preceding the Miocene epoch.  The Narmada-Tapi alluvial deposits primarily formed during the Pleistocene epoch, not the Pliocene. The East African Rift system began developing during the Oligocene to Miocene epochs, not the Pleistocene.  Continental carbonate stores are formed over long geological timescales, with significant contributions across multiple epochs including the Holocene, but their primary formation is not exclusively confined to this period.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched according to the provided geological timescale.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                 Process/Feature
1. Carbon Dioxide                     :  Released during decomposition of organic matter
2. Carbonic Acid                       :  Formed from methane oxidation
3. Ethanol                             :  Reduces petrol emission
4.  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)       :   Higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Carbon dioxide is indeed released during the decomposition of organic matter as part of the carbon cycle.  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) do possess a significantly higher global warming potential compared to carbon dioxide. Ethanol, when blended with petrol as a biofuel, contributes to reduced emissions compared to using pure petrol. However, carbonic acid is formed from the reaction of carbon dioxide with water, not from methane oxidation. Methane oxidation primarily yields carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Molecule                  Function/Characteristic
1. DNA                                 :   Transcription product is mRNA
2. RNA                                 :   Translated to protein
3. Antibodies                           :   Neutralizes viruses
4. Histones                            :  Wraps around RNA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

DNA is the template for transcription, producing messenger RNA (mRNA). RNA, specifically mRNA, is translated into proteins by ribosomes. Antibodies are indeed crucial components of the immune system, neutralizing viruses and other pathogens. However, histones are proteins that wrap around DNA, forming nucleosomes, and are not associated with RNA in the same way.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Energy Source                       Characteristic/Use
1. Ethanol                              :   Used in fuel cells
2. E20 fuel                             :  Contains ethanol
3.  Petrol                               : Blended with ethanol to reduce emissions
4.  Surplus food grains                 : Used for ethanol production



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

Ethanol is a viable fuel source used in fuel cells. E20 fuel, a blend of gasoline and ethanol, contains a 20% ethanol component.  Petrol is indeed blended with ethanol in many countries to reduce emissions. Surplus food grains are a common feedstock for ethanol production.  All the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Greenhouse Gas                       Process/Source
1. Methane                              : Oxidizes to carbon dioxide
2. Carbon Dioxide                      : Emitted during coal combustion
3. Carbon Dioxide                      : Composed of shale gas
4.  Carbon Dioxide                      : Removed by Ambient Air Capture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Methane does oxidize to form carbon dioxide. Coal combustion is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions.  Ambient Air Capture technology is designed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, while shale gas contains hydrocarbons which release carbon dioxide upon combustion, shale gas itself is not primarily *composed* of carbon dioxide.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Process                    Application/Feature
1. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing           :   Used in creating low-pungent mustard
2.  Algae Assisted Fuel Cells (AFC)     : Captures carbon dioxide
3.  Genome Editing (GE)                : Alters DNA
4.  rDNA technology                     : Manipulates RNA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9 is a gene-editing technology successfully used to create a low-pungent mustard variety. Algae Assisted Fuel Cells are designed to capture carbon dioxide. Genome editing techniques directly alter an organism's DNA. However, rDNA technology manipulates DNA, not RNA. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element          Associated Mineral
1. Uranium                     :   Galena
2. Thorium                     :   Pitchblende
3. Lead                         :   Monazite
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Thorium is found in the mineral pitchblende.  Pitchblende is a complex uranium ore that also contains other radioactive elements, including thorium.  Option (1) is incorrect because galena is the primary ore of lead, not uranium. Uranium is found in minerals like pitchblende, zircon, and monazite, among others. Option (3) is incorrect because monazite is primarily an ore of thorium, containing significant amounts of rare earth elements, and also some uranium.  It does not contain Lead as a primary constituent. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                      Known for Uranium Deposits
1. Rajasthan                  :   Significant reserves
2. Telangana                  :   Largest producer
3. Andhra Pradesh             :   Minor deposits
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Rajasthan is known for significant uranium deposits in India. While Andhra Pradesh also has uranium deposits, they are not considered the largest. Telangana is not a major uranium-producing state. Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly attribute the largest producer status to states that do not hold that position and incorrectly state the extent of deposits in other states.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geological Formation       Occurrence of Uranium
1. Alluvial aquifers           :   Absent
2. Crystalline rocks           :   Present
3. Granite                     :   Absent
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Uranium is found in crystalline rocks. Alluvial aquifers, while sometimes containing trace amounts of uranium leached from surrounding rocks, are not primary sources. Granite, a type of crystalline rock, is indeed a geological formation where uranium can be found. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly state the absence of uranium in formations where it can be found, and vice versa.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Associated with Uranium
1. Nickel                       :   Directly associated in ore formation
2. Thorium                     :   Radioactive decay product
3. Radon                        :   Isotope
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Nickel is not directly associated with uranium ore formation. Thorium is not a radioactive decay product of uranium; rather, it is a separate radioactive element that often co-occurs with uranium. Radon is a radioactive decay product of uranium, not an isotope of it. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.  The options present misleading connections between uranium and other elements and substances.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Health Effect                Caused by Uranium Exposure
1. Kidney toxicity              :   Directly linked
2. Neurological damage         :   Indirectly linked
3. Liver damage                 :   Not directly linked
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Kidney toxicity is a direct and well-established health effect of uranium exposure.  While uranium exposure *can* indirectly contribute to other health problems through various pathways, neurological and liver damage are not primary or direct consequences.  Uranium's primary toxicity is nephrotoxic (affecting the kidneys).  The distractors aim to confuse by including plausible but less direct consequences of exposure.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                   Uses Uranium
1. Fast Breeder Reactors       :   Primary fuel
2. ANEEL                       :   Secondary fuel
3. Nuclear Power Plants in India:   Primary fuel
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fast breeder reactors and nuclear power plants in India use uranium as a primary fuel source.  ANEEL (Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Limited, which might be misrepresented in your data) is not directly linked to uranium usage in the context of nuclear fuel.  The other options incorrectly include technologies that are not directly associated with uranium as a primary fuel.  The question tests knowledge about the role of uranium in different nuclear technologies.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Isotope                       Type of Uranium
1. 238U                         :   Fissile
2. 235U                         :   Fertile
3. U-234                        :   Fissile
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

235U is a fissile isotope of uranium, meaning it can sustain a nuclear chain reaction. 238U is a fertile isotope, meaning it can be converted into a fissile isotope (plutonium-239) through neutron capture. U-234 is also a fissile isotope but less abundant than U-235. The question tests understanding of the different isotopes of uranium and their nuclear properties. The distractors use similar numbering to confuse the candidate.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                 Role related to Uranium
1. WHO                          :   Sets permissible limits for environmental uranium levels
2. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS):   Regulates uranium mining
3. IAEA                         :   Monitors nuclear fuel usage
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) provides guidelines and recommendations for safe levels of uranium in the environment and drinking water. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays a crucial role in monitoring the use of nuclear fuel, including uranium, globally to prevent proliferation.  The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) primarily focuses on standardization and quality control within India and does not directly regulate uranium mining which falls under the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). The question assesses knowledge of the roles of international and national organizations in managing uranium.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pollutant                     Source of Lead Contamination
1. Fly ash                      :   Significant source
2. Leaded petrol                 :   Historical source
3. Lead batteries                :   Current source
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fly ash from coal combustion is a significant source of lead contamination in the environment. Leaded petrol was a major source of lead pollution historically, before its phase-out. Lead-acid batteries remain a current source of lead, although recycling efforts are reducing the environmental impact.  The question tests knowledge of different sources of lead contamination and their historical context.  The options include both current and historical sources to test the comprehensive knowledge of the candidate.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Product                       Contains Lead
1. Plastic toys                  :   Commonly found
2. Ayurvedic medicines          :   Potentially present
3. Paints and pigments           :   Historically used
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lead has been historically used in paints and pigments, though regulations have significantly reduced its use.  Lead can be found in some plastic toys, particularly those manufactured in countries with less stringent regulations.  Some traditional Ayurvedic medicines may contain lead as a contaminant or ingredient. The question requires knowledge of the presence of lead in various products and the historical context of its use. The options include both current and historical contexts to test the comprehensive knowledge of the candidate.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                    Property/Effect
1. Sulphur dioxide                       Contributes to ozone depletion
2. Carbon monoxide                       Causes respiratory problems
3. Carbonic acid                         Reacts with limestone to form calcium bicarbonate
4. Ammonia                              Used in fertilizer production
5.  Hydrogen sulfide                    Source of geothermal energy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because pairs 2, 3, and 4 represent accurate factual relationships. Carbon monoxide is a well-known air pollutant that causes respiratory problems due to its binding affinity to hemoglobin, reducing oxygen transport in the blood. Carbonic acid, formed by the reaction of carbon dioxide and water, reacts with limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce calcium bicarbonate, a process relevant to cave formation and water hardness. Ammonia is a crucial component in the production of various nitrogen-based fertilizers, playing a vital role in agriculture.

Option (a) is incorrect because sulphur dioxide primarily contributes to acid rain and respiratory issues, not directly to ozone depletion. While it can indirectly influence ozone levels, the primary ozone-depleting substances are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halocarbons.

Option (b) is incorrect as it excludes the correct pairing of carbonic acid and its reaction with limestone.  While ammonia is used in fertilizer production, the omission of the accurate relationship between carbonic acid and limestone makes this option incomplete.

Option (c) is incorrect because, while hydrogen sulfide is indeed found in geothermal sources, the inclusion of only this pair and the exclusion of the other correctly matched pairs makes this option faulty.

Therefore, option (d) encompasses all the correctly matched pairs, exhibiting a precise understanding of the chemical properties and applications of the compounds listed.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Process                                    Source/Product
1. Photosynthesis                           Releases carbon dioxide
2.  Combustion of fossil fuels            Produces sulphur dioxide
3.  Electrolysis of water                    Produces hydrogen
4. Steam reforming of hydrocarbons       Produces grey hydrogen
5. Transesterification                     Produces biodiesel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the pairs 3, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the processes and their outcomes. Electrolysis of water uses an electric current to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.  Steam reforming of hydrocarbons, a common method for hydrogen production, generates "grey" hydrogen because it releases carbon dioxide. Transesterification is a chemical process that converts vegetable oils or animal fats into biodiesel.

Option (b) is incorrect because photosynthesis releases oxygen, not carbon dioxide.  Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and produces oxygen as a byproduct.

Option (a) is incorrect for the same reason as (b); it incorrectly states that photosynthesis releases carbon dioxide.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of photosynthesis and carbon dioxide release.

The other options fail to correctly identify the products or byproducts of the given processes, demonstrating a lack of understanding of fundamental chemistry. Option (c) showcases a clear comprehension of the chemical processes involved and their respective products.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mineral                                    Chemical Element/Use
1. Limestone                                 Contains magnesium
2. Magnesite                                Contains calcium
3. Dolomite                                 Related to magnesite
4. Pyroxene                                 Contains magnesium
5. Olivine                                  Contains calcium


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because only pairs 3 and 4 are accurately matched.  Dolomite is a carbonate mineral closely related to magnesite, often found in similar geological formations. Pyroxene is a group of silicate minerals that commonly contain magnesium.

Option (a) is incorrect because limestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate and does not contain significant amounts of magnesium.

Option (c) is incorrect because magnesite is a magnesium carbonate mineral; it does not contain calcium. Similarly, olivine is a silicate mineral rich in magnesium and iron, and it does not contain significant calcium.

Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons stated above concerning limestone, magnesite, and olivine.

The other options demonstrate a misunderstanding of the chemical composition of these minerals. Option (b) shows a precise understanding of the mineralogical relationships and elemental compositions.



**4. With reference to alternative energy sources, consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                          Characteristic/Process
1. Biodiesel                               Produced through fermentation
2. Ethanol                                  Produced through transesterification
3. Hydrogen                               Produced via electrolysis of water
4. Methanol                                Used in fuel cells
5. Biofuels                                Carbon-neutral potential


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Hydrogen is indeed produced via the electrolysis of water, a process that splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity.  Biofuels, derived from biological sources, have the potential to be carbon-neutral if the carbon dioxide released during combustion is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed during the growth of the biomass.

Option (a) is incorrect because biodiesel is produced through transesterification, not fermentation. Fermentation is used in the production of ethanol.

Option (c) is incorrect because ethanol is produced through fermentation, and while methanol can be a fuel, its primary use is not in fuel cells; hydrogen is more commonly used in fuel cells.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairings of biodiesel and fermentation, and ethanol and transesterification.

The other options demonstrate a lack of understanding of biofuel production methods and applications. Option (b) highlights a precise understanding of the processes involved in hydrogen production and the potential of biofuels.


**5. With reference to the chemical compounds and their properties, consider the following pairs:**

   Compound                                 Property/Use
1.  Ethylene                                Used in artificial ripening of fruits
2. Liquid nitrogen                         Used in cryotherapy
3.  Methanol                                Toxic if ingested
4.  Ammonia                                Used as a refrigerant
5.  Sulphuric acid                         Used in the production of fertilizers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is the correct answer because all pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 accurately reflect the properties and uses of the listed compounds. Ethylene gas is used to artificially ripen fruits, liquid nitrogen's extremely low temperature makes it suitable for cryotherapy, methanol is highly toxic if ingested, and sulphuric acid is a crucial component in the production of various fertilizers.

Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the accurate pairings of methanol and its toxicity and sulphuric acid and its use in fertilizer production.

Option (b) is incorrect as it incorrectly states that ammonia is used as a refrigerant (while it has been used historically, it's not a common modern application due to safety concerns).

Option (c) is incorrect because it excludes the accurate pairing of sulphuric acid and its use in fertilizer production.

The other options contain one or more inaccurate pairings, showcasing a lack of thorough understanding of the chemical properties and applications of these substances.  Option (d) displays a complete and accurate understanding of the facts.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                     Characteristic/Use
1. Diesel                         Used in heavy-duty engines
2. Petrol                          Has an energy density of 40-44 MJ/kg
3. Kerosene                      Adulterant of gasoline and diesel
4. Biodiesel                      Alternative to diesel
5. Methanol                       Alternative fuel for both petrol and diesel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched based on established facts and common knowledge about fuel types.  Diesel is predominantly used in heavy-duty engines due to its higher energy density and suitability for such applications. Petrol, with its energy density ranging from 40 to 44 MJ/kg, is a common fuel for internal combustion engines. Kerosene, while having its own uses, is unfortunately often used as an adulterant in gasoline and diesel fuel, reducing their quality and impacting engine performance. Biodiesel serves as a renewable and sustainable alternative to conventional diesel fuel, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Finally, methanol (CH3OH), also known as wood alcohol, is a colorless and fairly volatile liquid, considered an alternative fuel source for both petrol and diesel engines, although its widespread adoption faces challenges related to toxicity and infrastructure.  Therefore, all five pairs represent accurate relationships between the fuel type and its characteristic or use.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound              Reaction/Product
1. Carbonic acid                  Reacts with limestone to form calcium carbonate
2. Carbon dioxide                  Forms carbonic acid in water
3. Calcium bicarbonate            Produced by the reaction of carbonic acid and limestone
4. CO2                             Reacts to form Calcium Bicarbonate
5. Methanol                        Alternative fuel for diesel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) reacts with limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO₃) to form calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO₃)₂), a soluble compound. This reaction is crucial in the formation of caves. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) dissolving in water forms carbonic acid, a weak acid.  Calcium bicarbonate is indeed a product of the reaction between carbonic acid and limestone. However, CO2 alone cannot directly react to form calcium bicarbonate; it needs to first form carbonic acid in water. Methanol is an alternative fuel but its relation is not directly with this chemical reaction. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete representations of the accurate chemical reactions and products.  Only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                     Characteristic/Requirement
1. Sugarcane                 Requires significant water usage
2. Sugarcane                 Grown in temperate regions
3. Sugarcane                 Produced in North Bengal
4. Sugarcane                 Economic alternative to sugar imports
5.  Mustard                   Contains high levels of glucosinolates


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Sugarcane cultivation is indeed water-intensive, requiring substantial irrigation. North Bengal is a significant sugarcane-producing region in India.  Domestic sugarcane production serves as an important alternative to relying on sugar imports.  However, sugarcane is a tropical and subtropical crop; it does not thrive in temperate regions.  While mustard does contain glucosinolates, the question focuses on sugarcane characteristics. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrect statement about sugarcane's suitability for temperate regions. Option (a) correctly identifies the accurate pairings related to sugarcane's cultivation and economic significance.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biomolecule                 Component/Application
1. Proteins                     Composed of amino acids
2. Proteins                     Essential for synthesis of iron (Fe) in plants
3. Amino acids                  Building block of proteins
4.  Ethanol                      Derived from sugarcane
5.  Methanol                      Used in synthetic dyestuffs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Proteins are indeed composed of amino acids linked together in a specific sequence. Amino acids are the fundamental building blocks of proteins. Ethanol is a biofuel derived from the fermentation of sugarcane. Methanol is used in various industrial applications, including the production of synthetic dyestuffs.  However, the statement that proteins are essential for the synthesis of iron in plants is not entirely accurate. While iron is crucial for plant growth and chlorophyll production and plants need proteins for various metabolic processes,  it's not directly involved in *synthesizing* iron itself. Iron is absorbed from the soil. Thus, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the inaccurate statement regarding iron synthesis in plants. Only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pollutant/Additive           Fuel Type
1. Lead                           Diesel
2. Tetraethyl lead (TEL)       Petrol
3. Methanol                       Petrol (as an alternative fuel)
4. Lead                           Petrol
5.  Methanol                       Diesel (as an alternative fuel)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Tetraethyl lead (TEL) was historically used as an additive in petrol to improve its octane rating, although its use has largely been phased out due to its environmental toxicity. Methanol is considered an alternative fuel source for both petrol and diesel engines. Lead was indeed historically present as a contaminant in petrol but is not currently a deliberate additive. While methanol is being explored as an alternative fuel for diesel, lead is not a common contaminant in diesel. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) contain incorrect pairings.  Only option (d) accurately reflects the presence of TEL in petrol and the exploration of methanol as an alternative fuel for both petrol and diesel.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound             Energy Source/Application
1. Methane                         :   Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG)
2. Carbon Dioxide                 :   Heating
3. Ammonia                         :   Electricity Production
4. Sulphuric Acid                  :   Vehicle Fuel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Methane is a major component of biogas, and CBG is a refined form of biogas, making pair 1 correct.  Biogas, primarily composed of methane, is used for heating, making pair 2 correct.  While biogas can be used for electricity production, ammonia itself is not directly an energy source or application derived from biogas.  Sulphuric acid is not directly related to biogas applications; biogas can be used as vehicle fuel (biomethane), but not sulphuric acid. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The options are designed to be plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of biogas composition and applications.


**2. With reference to Biogas production, consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Process             Energy Source
1. Anaerobic digestion            :   Compressed Biogas (CBG)
2. Anaerobic decomposition of biomass :  Biogas
3.  Aerobic decomposition of organic matter : Methane
4. Microbial Inoculums           :  Biogas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Biogas is produced through the anaerobic decomposition of biomass, making pair 2 correct.  Anaerobic Microbial Inoculums are used to enhance biogas production, hence pair 4 is also correct.  While anaerobic digestion is a key process in biogas production, CBG is a refined form of biogas, not directly produced by anaerobic digestion alone. Aerobic decomposition does not produce methane; it's anaerobic decomposition that yields methane.  The incorrect pairings act as effective distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances of biogas production processes.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element          Application/Occurrence
1. Sulphur                      :   Constituent of Biodiesel
2. Iron                          :  Component of Haematite
3. Zinc                          :   Used in Rubber Industry
4. Manganese                    :   Deoxidizes Sulphur


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Iron is a major component of the iron ore haematite, making pair 2 correct. Zinc finds extensive use in the rubber industry, making pair 3 correct. Manganese is used as a deoxidizer for sulphur, which is crucial in various industrial processes, making pair 4 correct. Biodiesel has a low sulphur content; sulphur is not a constituent. The incorrect pairing serves as a distractor, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of industrial applications and mineral composition.



**4. With reference to the impact of Temperature, consider the following pairs:**

  Environmental Factor/Process       Effect of Temperature
1. Anaerobic digestion               :   Optimum temperature range
2.  Water holding capacity of air     : Increases with temperature
3.  Soil formation                  :   Influences rate
4.  Coral bleaching                  :   Caused by high temperatures


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Anaerobic digestion has an optimum temperature range for efficient microbial activity. Soil formation is significantly influenced by temperature, affecting various chemical and biological processes.  Coral bleaching is primarily caused by elevated water temperatures. The water holding capacity of air decreases with increasing temperature due to increased molecular kinetic energy. The inclusion of the incorrect statement about water holding capacity acts as a strong distractor, ensuring the question tests a nuanced understanding of the topic.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Chemical Compound             Source/Application
1. Nitrate                         :   Absorbed by plants
2. Ammonia                         :   Used to produce Urea
3.  Methane                        :   Component of Biogas
4. Carbon Dioxide                  :   Byproduct of Anaerobic Digestion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Plants absorb nitrates as a primary source of nitrogen. Ammonia is a crucial raw material for urea production in the fertilizer industry. Methane is a significant component of biogas. Carbon dioxide is produced as a byproduct during anaerobic digestion. All four pairs accurately reflect the source and application of these chemical compounds.  This question acts as a final comprehensive test of knowledge across various aspects of the provided information.  While seemingly straightforward, the inclusion of all four correct pairs still requires a thorough grasp of the material to confidently select option (d).

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commodity                     Associated Chemical Compound
1.  Potato                         Solanine
2.  Onion                          Allyl propyl disulfide
3.  Tomato                         Lycopene
4.  Polyethylene                 Ethylene

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Solanine is a glycoalkaloid found in potatoes, particularly in the sprouts and green parts.  High levels of solanine can be toxic. Allyl propyl disulfide is a sulfur-containing compound responsible for the characteristic pungent odor and flavor of onions. Lycopene is a carotenoid pigment that gives tomatoes their red color and is also a potent antioxidant.  Polyethylene is a polymer, but it's not directly associated with these vegetables in the same way as the other compounds. While ethylene is used in the artificial ripening of tomatoes, it's not a constituent compound of the tomato itself.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 represent accurate associations between a commodity and a chemical compound naturally present within or closely associated with its production.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fusion Technology              Associated Research Facility
1.  Tokamak                         ITER
2.  Magnetic Confinement Fusion  JET
3.  Tokamak                         EAST
4.  Tokamak                         JT-60

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The ITER project is a large-scale international collaboration focused on developing a tokamak-based fusion reactor.  EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) and JT-60 are both tokamak-type fusion experimental reactors.  While JET (Joint European Torus) is also a tokamak, the pair linking magnetic confinement fusion to JET is inaccurate because while JET utilizes magnetic confinement, it's not solely defined by that technology; it's a specific example of a tokamak which is a type of magnetic confinement fusion device.  Therefore, options 1, 3, and 4 correctly link a fusion technology (Tokamak) with an associated research facility.  Option 2 incorrectly generalizes a type of fusion to a specific research facility.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Plant Hormone                   Primary Function
1.  Auxin                            Apical Dominance
2.  Gibberellin                      Cell Division
3.  Cytokinin                         Cell Elongation
4.  Abscisic Acid                   Growth Inhibition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Auxins are plant hormones primarily responsible for apical dominance, the phenomenon where the main stem grows more vigorously than lateral branches. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that inhibits growth, often in response to stress conditions. While gibberellins are involved in cell elongation and cytokinins play a role in cell division, the primary functions are not solely confined to these aspects; they also influence other aspects of plant growth and development.  Hence only the pairs related to auxin and abscisic acid accurately reflect the primary functions of these plant hormones.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound             Industrial Application
1.  Ethylene                       Fruit Ripening
2.  Polyethylene                   Plastic Production
3.  Ethylene Glycol               Antifreeze
4.  Ethylene Oxide                 Sterilization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Ethylene is a plant hormone used commercially for fruit ripening. Polyethylene is a widely used plastic made from ethylene. Ethylene glycol is a common component of antifreeze solutions. Ethylene oxide is a powerful sterilizing agent used in medical and industrial settings.  All four pairs accurately link a chemical compound to one of its major industrial applications.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Acid                            Source/Location
1.  Acetic Acid                    Vinegar
2.  Lactic Acid                   Sour Milk
3.  Hydrochloric Acid             Gastric Juice
4.  Sulphuric Acid                Bones


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Acetic acid is the main component of vinegar. Lactic acid is produced during the souring of milk. Hydrochloric acid is a major component of gastric juice.  However, the assertion that sulphuric acid is found in bones is incorrect;  bones primarily contain calcium phosphate. Therefore, only the first three pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                     Related Application/Property
1. Ethylene Oxide                         :   Used as a sterilizing agent
2. Polyethylene                          :   Component of plastic bags
3. Methane                               :   Major component of natural gas
4.  Ethylene Glycol                      :   Used as an antifreeze agent
5.  Carbon Dioxide                        :   Used in carbonated beverages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only

4.  Iron                                  : Good conductor of electricity
5.  Copper                               : Used in electricity networks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Four out of the five pairs are correctly matched.  Methane is a major component of biogas, a renewable energy source. Ethylene is a plant hormone that plays a crucial role in various plant processes, including ripening. Carbon dioxide is a component of biogas, although it’s a byproduct rather than a primary fuel source. Iron is known for its excellent electrical conductivity, a property that makes it widely used in various electrical applications. Copper, known for its high electrical conductivity and resistance to corrosion, is a crucial component in modern electricity networks, including power lines and wiring.  Only the pairing of  "Calcium-41" and "Radiometric dating" is incorrect in this context.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Four of the pairs are correctly matched. Polyethylene is a common thermoplastic used extensively in the manufacture of plastic bottles. Copper is a primary component of bronze alloys. Iron is a key element in various steel alloys. Graphite, a form of carbon, is the primary material in pencil leads. However, bronze is not typically used in modern electrical networks.  Its use was prevalent historically but has been largely replaced by copper and other materials in modern applications. Thus, option (d) represents the most accurate selection.  This question highlights the importance of precise knowledge of material science and its evolution.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Celestial Body          Phenomenon Influenced
1. Moon                     :    Earth's Rotation
2. Sun                       :    Lunar Tides
3. Earth                     :    Solar Flares
4. Jupiter                   :    Neap Tides

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Moon's gravitational pull significantly influences Earth's rotation, causing tidal bulges and slowing down the Earth's spin over geological time.  This tidal interaction is a well-established phenomenon in celestial mechanics. Option 2 is incorrect because lunar tides are primarily influenced by the Moon's gravity, not the Sun's. While the Sun does exert a tidal force, the Moon's proximity to Earth makes its effect dominant. Option 3 is incorrect; solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation from the Sun, unrelated to Earth's rotation or the Moon's influence. Option 4 is incorrect as Neap tides are caused by the combined gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon when they are at right angles to each other, minimizing the tidal range.  Therefore, only the pairing of the Moon and its influence on Earth's rotation is accurately matched.


**2. With reference to the Earth's atmosphere, consider the following pairs:**

   Atmospheric Component     Source
1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2)     :     Volcanic Eruptions
2. Oxygen (O2)              :     Photosynthesis
3. Nitrogen (N2)            :     Fossil Fuels
4. Methane (CH4)           :     Decomposition of Organic Matter

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Volcanic eruptions are a significant natural source of carbon dioxide, releasing it into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, is the primary source of atmospheric oxygen.  Decomposition of organic matter, including plant and animal remains, produces methane as a byproduct.  While nitrogen is abundant in the atmosphere, fossil fuels are not a primary source of atmospheric nitrogen; they are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen.  Instead, the majority of atmospheric nitrogen originates from geological processes. Thus, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Metal                     Use in Industry
1. Copper                    :     Rubber Industry
2. Zinc                      :     Electrical Industry
3. Aluminium                 :     Construction Industry
4. Iron                       :     Aerospace Industry


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aluminium is extensively used in the construction industry due to its lightweight yet strong properties. Iron and its alloys (steel) are critical materials in aerospace engineering for their strength-to-weight ratio and ability to withstand high stresses. Copper is primarily used in the electrical industry due to its excellent conductivity. Zinc finds considerable application in corrosion protection (galvanization) of steel and iron. The rubber industry does not heavily rely on copper as a primary component. Therefore, only the pairs relating to aluminium's use in construction and iron's role in aerospace are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to minerals and their primary uses, consider the following pairs:**

   Mineral                     Primary Use
1. Bauxite                     :     Production of Iron
2. Magnetite                 :     Production of Aluminium
3. Sphalerite                  :     Production of Zinc
4. Hematite                   :     Production of Copper

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Sphalerite is the primary ore of zinc, from which zinc metal is extracted. Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum, not iron. Magnetite is a crucial iron ore, not an aluminum ore. Hematite is also a significant iron ore, not a copper ore.  Therefore, only the pairing of sphalerite with its use in zinc production is correct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Element       Abundance in Earth's Crust
1. Oxygen                  :     Least Abundant
2. Silicon                  :     Second Most Abundant
3. Aluminium               :     Most Abundant
4. Iron                     :     Third Most Abundant

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, followed by silicon and then aluminum. Iron is a significant component but not the third most abundant, ranking lower than aluminum. Therefore, only the pairings of silicon as the second most abundant and aluminum as the most abundant are correct.


**6. With reference to the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, consider the following pairs:**

    Gas                     Percentage Composition (Approximate)
1. Nitrogen                  :    78%
2. Oxygen                    :    21%
3. Argon                     :    0.93%
4. Carbon Dioxide            :    4%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nitrogen constitutes approximately 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, oxygen about 21%, and argon about 0.93%.  Carbon dioxide's concentration is significantly lower than 4%, currently around 0.04%. Therefore, only the pairs for nitrogen, oxygen, and argon are correctly matched with their approximate percentage compositions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound         Use
1. Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) :   Photography
2. Sodium Chloride (NaCl)   :   Food Preservation
3. Calcium Sulphate (CaSO4):  Water Softening
4.  Copper Sulphate (CuSO4) :   Fungicide

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Potassium nitrate is historically used in photography as an oxidizer in some processes. Sodium chloride (common salt) is used for food preservation due to its antimicrobial properties. Copper sulphate is a fungicide used in agriculture.  Calcium sulphate is associated with hard water, not water softening. Therefore, only the pairs for potassium nitrate, sodium chloride, and copper sulphate are correctly matched with their uses.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vitamin                     Deficiency Disease
1. Niacin                     :    Rickets
2. Thiamine                   :    Beriberi
3. Vitamin D                  :    Pellagra
4. Vitamin K                  :    Night Blindness

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Thiamine deficiency leads to beriberi.  Niacin deficiency causes pellagra, not rickets. Vitamin D deficiency results in rickets. Vitamin K deficiency does not cause night blindness; that is usually associated with vitamin A deficiency.  Therefore, only the pairing of thiamine with beriberi is correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Radiation Type                     Medical Application
1. X-rays                              :   Radiation therapy for cancer
2. Gamma rays                          :   Diagnostic imaging of bones
3. Ultrasound waves                   :   Fetal growth monitoring

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

X-rays are indeed used in radiation therapy to target and destroy cancerous cells.  This is a well-established and widely used medical application.  Option (a) is therefore correct.

Option (b) is incorrect because while gamma rays are used in some medical applications,  they are not primarily used for diagnostic imaging of bones; X-rays are far more common for this purpose.  Gamma rays are more often used in radiation therapy, similar to X-rays, but with different penetration capabilities.

Option (c) is incorrect because, although ultrasound waves are used for fetal growth monitoring, this does not make the pairing of gamma rays with bone imaging correct. The correct pairing of ultrasound waves with fetal growth monitoring is overshadowed by the incorrect pairing of gamma rays with bone imaging.

Option (d) is incorrect because it combines the correct pairing of X-rays with radiation therapy with two incorrect pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mineral                                  Metal
1. Ilmenite                               :   Titanium
2. Bauxite                                 :   Aluminum
3. Hematite                               :   Iron

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ilmenite is a titanium-iron oxide mineral, making the first pair correct. Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum, making the second pair correct.  Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.

Option (a) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pair of Bauxite and Aluminum.

Option (c) is incorrect as it incorrectly includes Hematite as a source of Titanium; Hematite is primarily an iron ore.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Hematite with Iron. While Hematite is an important iron ore, the question focuses on precise and accurate pairings, and the inclusion of the inaccurate pairing makes the entire option incorrect.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Atomic Property                         Description
1. Atomic Number                         :   Number of neutrons in an atom
2. Mass Number                           :   Sum of protons and electrons
3. Isotopes                               :   Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The atomic number is defined as the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, not neutrons.  The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons, not protons and electrons.  Isotopes are atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.  Only the third pair is correctly matched. Therefore, (c) is correct.

Option (a) is incorrect because the description of atomic number is wrong.

Option (b) is incorrect because the description of mass number is wrong.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes two incorrect pairings.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                 Use in Production
1. Pig Iron                               :   Steel Manufacturing
2. Graphite                               :   Pencil Lead
3. Ilmenite                               :   Production of Gallium

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pig iron is an intermediate product in steel manufacturing. Graphite is a key component in pencil lead. These two pairs are correctly matched.  Ilmenite is primarily used in the production of titanium, not gallium. Therefore, option (b) is correct.

Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of graphite and pencil lead.

Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect pairing of ilmenite with gallium.

Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect pairing of ilmenite with gallium.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Physical Phenomenon                     Example
1. Ionizing Radiation                     :   Ultraviolet rays
2. X-rays                                 :   Medical imaging
3.  Photoacoustic effect                   :    Ultrasound generation from light absorption


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

X-rays are a type of ionizing radiation, and are used extensively in medical imaging.  The photoacoustic effect describes the generation of ultrasound waves from the absorption of light, a phenomenon used in certain medical imaging techniques. However, ultraviolet rays are not ionizing radiation to the same extent as X-rays or gamma rays. Therefore, only two pairs are correctly matched.

Option (a) is incorrect because more than one pair is correctly matched.

Option (c) is incorrect because one pair is incorrectly matched.

Option (d) is incorrect because two pairs are correctly matched.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound             Application/Property
1. Ethylene (C₂H₄)                 :   Used in cryotherapy
2. Liquid Nitrogen (N₂)            :   Artificial ripening of fruits
3. Methanol (CH₃OH)              :   Component in some hand sanitizers
4. Fomepizole                      :   Antidote for methanol poisoning


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Methanol (CH₃OH), also known as wood alcohol, is a component found in some hand sanitizers, as noted in the text's discussion of the US recall of hand sanitizers containing methanol.  Fomepizole is explicitly identified as an antidote for methanol poisoning.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Ethylene is used for artificial ripening, not liquid nitrogen.  Liquid nitrogen is used in cryotherapy (freezing) and food transportation. Pair 2 is also incorrect.  The text specifies that ethylene, not liquid nitrogen, is used for artificial ripening of fruits, although its use is regulated. Pair 1 incorrectly swaps the applications of ethylene and liquid nitrogen.


**2. With reference to Glycemic Index (GI) and its implications, consider the following pairs:**

   Food Characteristic/Factor          Effect/Relationship
1. High GI foods                       :   Slow digestion, sustained blood sugar levels
2. Amylose                             :   Internal factor affecting GI
3. Glycemic Load (GL)                 :   Calculated by subtracting GI from total carbohydrates
4. Prof. David Jenkins                 :   Proposed the Glycemic Load (GL)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because only pair 2 is correctly matched. Amylose is correctly identified as an internal factor that influences the Glycemic Index (GI) of food.

Pair 1 is incorrect. High GI foods cause *rapid*, not slow, fluctuations in blood sugar levels.  Pair 3 is incorrect.  Glycemic Load (GL) is calculated by *multiplying*, not subtracting, the GI by the amount of carbohydrates in a serving. Pair 4 is incorrect.  Prof. David Jenkins proposed the Glycemic Index (GI), not the Glycemic Load (GL).


**3. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following pairs:**

   Virus Protein/Characteristic         Effect/Classification
1. Hemagglutinin (H) and Neuraminidase (N) :   Determine LPAI and HPAI virus subtypes
2. LPAI viruses                        :   Cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry
3. HPAI viruses                        :   Cause mild or no disease in poultry
4. World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) :  Conducts global influenza surveillance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins on the surface of influenza A viruses are indeed used to classify subtypes.

Pair 2 is incorrect. LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, not severe disease and high mortality.  Pair 3 is incorrect. HPAI viruses cause severe disease and high mortality, not mild or no disease. Pair 4 is incorrect. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) collaborates on animal health, but global influenza surveillance is conducted through the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology/Condition       Characteristic/Application
1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)    :   Uses ionizing radiation
2. Meningococcal ACWY Vaccine         :   Protects against five strains of meningococcus bacteria
3. Men5CV vaccine                     :   Available in India
4. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) :   Characterized by low platelet count and blood clots


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct.  Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) is accurately described as a condition involving blood clots and low platelet count.

Pair 1 is incorrect. MRI does *not* use ionizing radiation; it uses magnets and radio waves. Pair 2 is incorrect.  The Men5CV vaccine protects against five strains, but the text mentions that the Meningococcal ACWY Vaccine is available in India, not the Men5CV vaccine. Pair 3 is also incorrect for the same reason as pair 2; it mismatches the vaccine availability.


**5. With reference to recent scientific advancements, consider the following pairs:**

   Scientific Concept/Technology      Description/Application
1. Retrotransposons                 :   Genetic elements replicating via reverse transcription
2.  Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)  :    A gut hormone that increases blood sugar levels
3.  Weight-loss drugs                 :   Mimic the action of GLP-1 to increase appetite
4.  Covishield vaccine                :   Has never been admitted to have rare side effects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. Retrotransposons are accurately defined as genetic elements that replicate through reverse transcription.

Pair 2 is incorrect. GLP-1 *reduces*, not increases, blood sugar levels by increasing insulin production and decreasing glucagon production. Pair 3 is incorrect. Weight-loss drugs mimic GLP-1 to *suppress* appetite, not increase it. Pair 4 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that AstraZeneca (the manufacturer of Covishield) admitted to rare side effects, including TTS.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the facts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound          Associated Process/Effect
1. Formaldehyde                Ozone layer depletion
2. Methane                      Enhanced Greenhouse Effect
3. Carbon Dioxide              Ocean Acidification

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are both potent greenhouse gases, significantly contributing to the enhanced greenhouse effect and subsequent global warming.  Carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater to form carbonic acid, leading to ocean acidification.  Formaldehyde, while a pollutant, does not directly deplete the ozone layer; ozone depletion is primarily associated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biological Entity           Associated Product/Process
1.  Penicillium fungus          Production of Aspirin
2.  Methanogenic archaea       Methane emission
3.  Host cell                   Viral replication


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because methanogenic archaea are microorganisms that produce methane through anaerobic respiration, and viruses replicate by invading and utilizing host cells.  Penicillin is produced by *Penicillium* fungi, not *aspirin*. Aspirin is a synthetic compound. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 show accurate associations.


**3. With reference to Global Warming, consider the following pairs:**

   Phenomenon/Impact          Causal Factor/Process
1. Increased frequency of heatwaves :   Decreased dissolved oxygen in water
2.  Sea level rise                 :   Thermal expansion of water and melting glaciers
3.  Arctic Amplification           :   Higher absorption of solar radiation at higher latitudes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Global warming leads to sea level rise due to thermal expansion of water (water expands as it warms) and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets.  Arctic amplification, the phenomenon where the Arctic warms at a faster rate than the global average, is caused by the higher absorption of solar radiation at higher latitudes due to ice-albedo feedback.  While decreased dissolved oxygen in water is a consequence of global warming, it’s not the direct cause of increased heatwaves; heatwaves are primarily a direct result of rising air temperatures.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gas                                      Impact/Source
1.  Butane                                   Component of LPG
2.  Methane                                 Produced by methanogens
3.  Carbon Dioxide                           Primary product of photosynthesis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Butane is a major component of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Methane is produced by methanogenic archaea and other biological sources. However, the primary product of photosynthesis is glucose, not carbon dioxide;  photosynthesis *consumes* carbon dioxide. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Microorganism              Disease/Process
1.  Bacteria                     Viral Replication
2.  Fungi                        Penicillin Production
3.  Viruses                      Invading Host Cells

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Fungi, specifically *Penicillium* species, are known for producing penicillin. Viruses replicate by invading and taking over host cells. However, bacteria are not directly involved in viral replication; they are separate types of microorganisms. Therefore, only two pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the effects of Global Warming, consider the following pairs:**

   Effect                                    Mechanism
1. Increased melting of cryosphere       Enhanced greenhouse effect trapping heat
2. Increased incidence of El Niño          Changes in ocean currents and atmospheric pressure
3.  Ocean acidification                     Increased carbon dioxide absorption by oceans

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  The enhanced greenhouse effect, caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities, traps more heat, leading to increased melting of the cryosphere (ice caps, glaciers, and permafrost).  Changes in ocean currents and atmospheric pressure patterns, influenced by global warming, contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of El Niño events.  Finally, the increased absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans leads to the formation of carbonic acid, causing ocean acidification.  Therefore, all three pairs accurately describe causal relationships related to global warming.


These questions test factual recall, analysis (identifying correct relationships), and evaluation (determining the accuracy of the pairings).  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, thereby increasing the difficulty level.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Malicious Software          Specific Example
1.  Adware                              :   Spyware

4.  Virus                                :   Worm


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The question tests the understanding of various types of malicious software and their examples.  Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Adware and Spyware:** While both are unwanted software, they are distinct. Adware displays unwanted advertisements, whereas spyware secretly monitors user activity.  Therefore, this pairing is incorrect.

2. **Ransomware and Trojan Horse:** Ransomware encrypts a user's files and demands a ransom for their release. A Trojan horse disguises itself as legitimate software to gain access to a system.  Although both are malicious, they operate differently; hence, this pairing is incorrect.

3. **Rootkit and Keylogger:** A rootkit provides unauthorized access and control over a computer system, often concealing its presence. A keylogger records keystrokes, which *can* be a component of a rootkit but is not exclusively defined as one. Thus, the pairing is incorrect.

4. **Virus and Worm:** Viruses require a host program to replicate, while worms can self-replicate and spread independently across networks. This pairing is also incorrect.

All pairs present incorrect pairings of malicious software types and their examples.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d) None.  Understanding the nuanced differences between these types of malware is crucial for cybersecurity awareness.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Software Category                     Specific Software
1.  Operating System                    :   Spyware
2.  Application Software                :   Microsoft Word
3.  System Utility Software             :   Disk Defragmenter
4.  Malicious Software                  :   Virus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of software categories and examples. Let's evaluate each pair:

1. **Operating System and Spyware:** An operating system (OS) manages computer hardware and software resources. Spyware is a type of malicious software, not an OS.  Therefore, this pairing is incorrect.

2. **Application Software and Microsoft Word:** Application software performs specific tasks for users, and Microsoft Word is a prime example of word-processing application software. This is a correct pairing.

3. **System Utility Software and Disk Defragmenter:** System utilities manage and maintain computer systems. Disk defragmenter reorganizes fragmented files on a hard drive, a typical system utility function. This is a correct pairing.

4. **Malicious Software and Virus:** Viruses are a type of malicious software designed to damage or disrupt computer systems. This is a correct pairing.

Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The correct answer is (d).  The question tests the ability to classify different software types and recognize their functionalities.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic of Spyware        Description
1.  Data Theft                       :   Collecting user's Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

3.  Identity Theft                    :   Using stolen data for fraudulent activities
4.  Network compromise              :   Installing backdoors for remote access


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

This question delves into the characteristics and effects of spyware.

1. **Data theft and PII collection:** Spyware's primary function is often stealing sensitive data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This is a correct match.

2. **System slowdown and increased CPU usage:** Spyware running in the background consumes system resources, leading to performance degradation.  This is correctly matched.

3. **Identity theft and fraudulent activities:** Stolen PII from spyware can be used for identity theft and various fraudulent activities. This is a correct match.

4. **Network compromise and backdoors:** Advanced spyware can create backdoors, enabling remote access and control, thus compromising the network security. This is a correct match.

All four pairs accurately describe characteristics and effects of spyware.  Therefore, the correct option is (c). The question assesses the understanding of spyware's impact on user systems and data security.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Malware              Method of Operation
1.  Trojan Horse                     :   Disguised as legitimate software
2.  Spyware                           :   Monitors user activity secretly
3.  Ransomware                        :   Encrypts files and demands ransom
4.  Virus                             :   Self-replicates and spreads rapidly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

This question tests the knowledge of different malware categories and their operational methods.

1. **Trojan Horse and disguise:** Trojan horses are malicious programs disguised as legitimate software to trick users into installing them. This is correctly matched.

2. **Spyware and secret monitoring:** Spyware secretly monitors user activity, collecting sensitive information without the user's knowledge or consent. This is correctly matched.

3. **Ransomware and file encryption:** Ransomware encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid. This is correctly matched.

4. **Virus and rapid spread:** While viruses don't always spread rapidly, they do self-replicate, infecting other files or systems. This is a reasonable simplification and a correct match within the context of the question.


All four pairs accurately describe the method of operation for the given malware types.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d). The question evaluates the ability to differentiate various types of malware based on their functionalities.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                       Property
1. Graphene                     :   High melting point
2. Tantalum                      :   Excellent thermal conductivity
3.  Vanadium                     :  High corrosion resistance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, is known for its exceptional thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity, not a high melting point.  Graphite, a form of carbon from which graphene is derived, has a very high melting point, but graphene itself does not exhibit the same characteristics in the same way.  Tantalum is indeed a rare metal with high corrosion resistance and a very high melting point, making it suitable for applications where extreme conditions are present. Vanadium, a transition metal, is also known for its high strength-to-weight ratio and its use in enhancing the tensile strength of steel, but its primary notable property isn't high corrosion resistance compared to tantalum which is renowned for its exceptional corrosion resistance, even at elevated temperatures. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Application
1.  Giant Magnetoresistance       :   Solar cells
2.  Brain-Computer Interface     :   Treatment of neurological disorders
3.  3D Printing                  :   Construction of hyperloop tunnels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is a phenomenon where the electrical resistance of a material changes significantly in the presence of a magnetic field.  Its primary application is in data storage devices like hard disk drives, not in solar cells which utilize photovoltaic effects. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are indeed being developed for potential applications in treating neurological disorders and enabling communication for individuals with paralysis.  3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a versatile technology applicable across numerous sectors, including aerospace, construction and biomedical engineering. Its use in constructing hyperloop tunnels, considering the hyperloop's design, would be a potential and feasible application. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Element/Compound                 Feature/Use
1.  White Phosphorus                 :   Component in fertilizers
2.  Supercritical Carbon Dioxide     :    Enhanced oil recovery
3.  Tantalum                         :   Substitute for Platinum


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

White phosphorus, while also having military applications as an incendiary agent, is indeed a component in certain fertilizers. Supercritical carbon dioxide, a fluid state of CO2 beyond its critical point, shows promise in enhanced oil recovery techniques by flushing out oil from depleted reservoirs.  Tantalum, due to its high melting point and corrosion resistance, can serve as a substitute for platinum in certain applications where cost is a factor and high temperature resistance is needed.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Isotope                           Application
1. Calcium-41                      :   Radiometric dating of organic materials older than 50,000 years
2. Carbon-14                      :   Radiometric dating of relatively recent organic materials
3.  Potassium-40/Argon-40         :  Radiometric dating of rocks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Calcium-41, while a long-lived radioisotope used in radiometric dating through a technique called Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA), is not suitable for dating materials older than 50,000 years.  Carbon-14, with a half-life of 5,700 years, is effectively used for dating relatively recent organic materials.  Potassium-40/Argon-40 dating is a well-established method for determining the age of rocks and other geological materials. Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                         Type
1.  Lab-grown Diamonds            :  Produced from coke and pith
2.  Synthetic Graphite             :  Artificially manufactured
3.  Natural Graphite                :  High crystalline, Amorphous and Flake


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lab-grown diamonds are indeed artificially manufactured, but they are not produced from coke and pith. That process is associated with synthetic graphite production. Synthetic graphite is, correctly, artificially manufactured.  Natural graphite exists in various forms, including high crystalline, amorphous, and flake varieties.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Concept/Technology              Description
1.  Meissner Effect               :   Expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor at room temperature
2.  Room-Temperature Superconductor :  Exhibits superconductivity at temperatures above 0°C
3.  Cooper Pairs                   :   Loosely bound pairs of electrons formed at very low temperatures


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Meissner effect is the expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor as it transitions to a superconducting state upon cooling below its critical temperature (Tc),  not at room temperature. Room-temperature superconductors, a highly sought-after material, would indeed exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above 0°C. Cooper pairs are the loosely bound electron pairs responsible for superconductivity, formed when temperatures are lowered below a critical level, enabling unimpeded electron flow.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Robot                  Example
1. Industrial Robot                 :   Surgical robot
2. Service Robot                    :   Delivery drone
3. Medical Robot                   :   Robot used in manufacturing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Industrial robots are primarily used in manufacturing processes, not in surgical procedures.  Service robots perform tasks in various non-manufacturing settings; a delivery drone is a good example. Medical robots are specifically designed for healthcare applications, such as surgery. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly associate robot types with their applications.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nanomaterial                    Characteristic
1. Gold Nanoparticles              :   Photoacoustic properties
2. Copper Sulphide Nanoparticles   :   Photothermal properties
3. Hybrid Nanoparticles (Gold and Copper Sulphide) : Size less than 8nm


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Gold nanoparticles can indeed exhibit photoacoustic properties, meaning they absorb light and generate ultrasound waves, useful in diagnostics. Copper sulphide nanoparticles possess photothermal properties, generating heat when exposed to light, a characteristic useful in cancer treatment.  Hybrid nanoparticles, combining gold and copper sulphide, are often less than 8nm in size.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  The combination of properties makes them suitable for combined diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Technique                      Application/Use
1.  CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing              :   Producing low-pungent mustard varieties
2.  Aerial metagenomics                    :   Analyzing soil microbial communities
3.  Wolbachia method                         :   Controlling the spread of malaria
4.  Microsatellite DNA analysis            :   Studying genetic diversity in plant populations
5.  Genetic engineering of crops           :   Increasing phosphorus content in crops


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR-Cas9 is a precise gene-editing tool used to modify specific genes within an organism's genome.  Its application in developing low-pungent mustard varieties by altering genes responsible for glucosinolate production is a well-documented example.  Microsatellite DNA analysis, which focuses on short, repetitive DNA sequences, is a powerful tool for studying genetic variation within and between populations of organisms, including plants.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.

Option (a) is incorrect because while CRISPR-Cas9 is correctly matched, the other pairs are not.  Option (c) is incorrect as the Wolbachia method is primarily used for controlling mosquito-borne diseases, not malaria specifically. While genetic engineering can indirectly affect nutrient content, directly increasing phosphorus is not its primary aim.  Option (d) is incorrect because aerial metagenomics is used to analyze airborne microbial communities, not soil communities.  The technique's focus is on the genetic material in the air, not soil samples.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                     Vector/Agent
1.  Dengue fever                             :   Aedes aegypti mosquito
2.  Zika fever                               :   Culex mosquito
3.  Chikungunya                              :   Aedes albopictus mosquito
4.  Malaria                                  :   Anopheles mosquito


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dengue fever and chikungunya are both arboviruses transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, respectively.  Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of malaria and Anopheles mosquitoes. Option (c) is incorrect because it wrongly pairs Zika virus with the Culex mosquito. While Culex mosquitoes can transmit some viruses, Zika is primarily spread by Aedes mosquitoes. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Zika fever and Culex mosquitoes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Technique                 Specific Application
1.  Plant tissue culture                      :   Producing disease-resistant banana plants
2.  Embryo culture                           :   Producing hybrid rice varieties
3.  Seed culture                             :   Mass propagation of orchids
4.  Organ culture                            :   Studying plant hormone effects on root development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Plant tissue culture techniques, including embryo culture, seed culture, and organ culture, are widely used in plant biotechnology.  Plant tissue culture is used for various applications, including producing disease-resistant varieties. Embryo culture is frequently used in hybrid seed production to overcome seed sterility issues. Seed culture enables mass propagation of valuable plants. Organ culture allows scientists to study the effects of plant hormones and other factors on specific plant parts. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  All options except (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                     Treatment/Intervention
    1. Hepatitis B                :   Antiviral medications
    2. Hepatitis C                :   Engerix-B vaccine
    3. Cancer                     :   Recombivax HB vaccine
    4.  Sickle Cell Disease       :  Bone marrow transplant

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Hepatitis B is primarily treated and prevented through vaccination (Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, Heplisav-B are all Hepatitis B vaccines). While antiviral medications can manage active infections, the vaccine is the cornerstone of prevention and control.  Therefore, pairing Hepatitis B with antiviral medication is a distractor, playing on the fact that antivirals *are* used in treatment. Sickle Cell Disease, being a genetic disorder, currently has bone marrow transplant as the only curative option.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary treatment or prevention methods for the listed diseases.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

CMEs and solar flares are both solar events that can significantly impact power grids.  CMEs, being massive ejections of plasma and magnetic field from the sun's corona, can induce powerful geomagnetic storms upon reaching Earth. These storms can induce large currents in power transmission lines, leading to widespread blackouts.  Solar flares, while not as massive as CMEs, release intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation. While the radiation itself doesn't directly cause power outages, the associated geomagnetic disturbances can still disrupt power grids through induced currents. Geomagnetic storms, while capable of affecting power grids, do not always result in significant disruptions. Their impact is often more subtle, causing minor fluctuations in voltage and frequency. The intensity of the geomagnetic storm is crucial in determining the extent of disruption.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the significant impact of CMEs and solar flares on power grids.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Earth's magnetic field is primarily generated by convection currents in the Earth's outer core, not plate tectonics.  Geomagnetic reversals, where the Earth's magnetic poles switch places, are a consequence of these chaotic convection currents. The Aurora Borealis and Australis (Northern and Southern Lights) are spectacular displays caused by the interaction of charged particles from the solar wind with the Earth's magnetic field.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 correctly match the geophysical phenomenon with its generating process.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographic Feature                    Interaction with Atmospheric Phenomenon
1. Earth's magnetic field                :   Auroras
2. Ionosphere                             :   Solar Flares absorption
3.  Magnetosphere                        :   Solar Wind deflection


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

The Earth's magnetic field interacts with charged particles from the solar wind to create the auroras. The ionosphere, a layer of the Earth's upper atmosphere, absorbs high-energy electromagnetic radiation from solar flares. The magnetosphere, a region around the Earth dominated by its magnetic field, deflects the majority of the solar wind, protecting the Earth from its harmful effects. All three pairs correctly match the geographic feature with its interaction with an atmospheric phenomenon.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.

3. Schwarzschild radius                  :   Related to the size of a neutron star
4. Standard Model                       :   Describes the strong and weak nuclear forces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Event Horizon correctly defines the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of a black hole.  The Schwarzschild radius is a crucial concept in general relativity that defines the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole.  The Standard Model of particle physics indeed successfully describes the electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces. However, the singularity is *not* located at the center of a galaxy; it's a point of infinite density at the center of a *black hole*.  Neutron stars have a radius but it isn't directly defined by the Schwarzschild radius which is specific to black holes. Option (b) is thus the only correct pairing. Option (a) is incorrect as it misses the correct pairing of the Standard Model. Option (c) is incorrect because the singularity is not at the center of a galaxy and the Schwarzschild radius doesn't describe the size of a neutron star. Option (d) is incorrect because of the incorrect pairing of the singularity and its location.

3. Moving bodies                         :   Electromagnetic waves


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The merger of black holes generates powerful gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime. Neutron star collisions also produce gravitational waves, but they also emit intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation across the spectrum, including radio waves.  Moving bodies, while they do create gravitational waves, the waves are generally too weak to detect with current technology.  The primary waves detected from moving celestial bodies are electromagnetic waves. Therefore, only pair 1 is definitively and accurately matched based on current detection capabilities. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include at least one mismatched pair.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Monsanto was initially the primary developer and producer of Bollgard, the first commercially successful Bt cotton variety in India.  This makes options 2 and 3 correct. While Monsanto later sold its agricultural business, including the Bollgard brand, the initial development and introduction of Bt cotton seeds in India are firmly attributed to Monsanto.  Option 1 is incorrect; Bollgard-II is a later generation of Bt cotton, and while Monsanto played a role in its development, the current ownership and marketing might be different. Option 4 is incorrect as Mahyco (Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company) was involved in the development of Bt brinjal, though it faced significant opposition and regulatory hurdles. Option 5 is also incorrect; Syngenta is another major player in the agricultural biotechnology sector but wasn't the primary developer of Bt cotton in India.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are definitively correct based on the historical context of Bt cotton introduction in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The development of various Bt crops relies on the insertion of genes from *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) bacteria, which produce insecticidal proteins. This makes options 1, 2, and 4 correct.  Bt brinjal, Bt cotton, and Bt papaya all utilize Bt genes for pest resistance. Option 3 is incorrect; Bt corn also uses Bt genes, but the statement incorrectly names *Bacillus cereus*.  Option 5 is incorrect; Bt soybean does not use *Bacillus subtilis*; it utilizes different genes for pest resistance. Therefore, only options 1, 2 and 4 accurately reflect the bacterial source of the insecticidal genes used in the development of these genetically modified crops.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Law/Act                     Impact on Monsanto

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Several Indian laws and acts have had a significant impact on Monsanto's operations in India. Option 1 is correct; Section 3(j) of the Indian Patents Act 1970, concerning inventions related to plants and animals, has been a key legal factor influencing Monsanto's patent rights on Bt cotton. Option 3 is also correct; the Plant Variety Protection and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, directly impacts the registration and protection of seed varieties, thereby affecting Monsanto's operations. Option 5 is correct because The Seeds Act, 1966 regulates seed quality, labeling, and distribution, so it would directly impact Monsanto's seed products. Option 2 is incorrect; while the Essential Commodities Act 1955 deals with essential commodities, its impact on Monsanto's seed pricing is indirect and not a direct regulation. Option 4 is also incorrect; the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, pertains to foreign exchange regulations and not specifically Monsanto's seed business. Therefore, only options 1, 3 and 5 accurately reflect the direct legal and regulatory impacts on Monsanto's activities in India.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                         Inheritance Pattern/Genetic Material
1. Haemophilia                    :   Autosomal recessive inheritance
2. Diabetes                       :   Inherited via mitochondrial DNA
3. Sickle Cell Anemia             :   Sex-linked inheritance on the X chromosome


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Haemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder inherited via the X chromosome.  Males are more commonly affected because they only have one X chromosome.  Females can be carriers but typically do not exhibit the disease unless they inherit two affected X chromosomes. Option 1 is incorrect because it states autosomal recessive inheritance which is a different pattern of inheritance.

Diabetes is a complex condition with genetic components, but its inheritance pattern is not solely through mitochondrial DNA.  While mitochondrial dysfunction can contribute to some forms of diabetes, the majority of cases are influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors. It is not a simple Mendelian inheritance pattern. Option 2 is incorrect because it oversimplifies the complex genetic basis of diabetes.

Sickle cell anemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning an individual needs two copies of the affected gene (one from each parent) to have the disease.  The gene is located on an autosome (non-sex chromosome). Option 3 is correct as it correctly identifies the inheritance pattern of Sickle Cell Anemia.

Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnological Process          Product
1. Hybridoma technology            :   Interferon
2. Recombinant DNA technology     :   Monoclonal Antibodies
3. Gene therapy                     :   Enzyme Replacement Therapy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Hybridoma technology is used for the commercial production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), not interferon. Interferons are produced through other biotechnological methods like recombinant DNA technology. Option 1 is incorrect because it mismatches the product with the process.

Recombinant DNA technology involves the insertion of a gene into a different organism to produce a desired protein.  While it can be used for the production of many therapeutic proteins,  it's not directly related to the generation of monoclonal antibodies.  Monoclonal antibodies are produced by the hybridoma technology. Option 2 is therefore incorrect.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a form of gene therapy that involves introducing functional enzymes into cells to compensate for deficiencies.  This is a direct application of gene therapy techniques. Option 3 is correct because it accurately reflects the application of gene therapy.

Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                     Treatment/Management Strategy
1. Diabetes                    :  National Programme for Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS)
2. Haemophilia                 : Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
3. Rare Diseases              : Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NPCDCS is a government program in India specifically designed to address diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke.  This makes pair 1 a correct match.

Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is used to treat dehydration, often associated with diarrheal diseases, not haemophilia. Haemophilia is managed through various methods like factor replacement therapy, not ORT. Option 2 is incorrect.

Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) is a common treatment strategy for several rare diseases where an enzyme deficiency is the underlying cause.  Many rare diseases fall under this category. Option 3 is correct.

Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Technology Procurement/Production

3. India                         :   Monoclonal antibodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While India utilizes and produces monoclonal antibodies, the primary development of hybridoma technology was not solely in India.  Many countries contributed to its advancement. Option 1 is therefore an oversimplification.

Australia, like many developed nations, engages in and produces various biotechnological advancements, including recombinant DNA technology.  However,  attributing its sole production to Australia is inaccurate. Option 2 is an oversimplification.

India does procure and produce monoclonal antibodies. This is a well-established fact. Option 3 is correct.

Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests the knowledge of the specific technological development and its relationship with specific countries.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Food Category                  Disease Complication

2. High GI foods                  :   Diabetes
3. Low GI foods                   :   Diabetes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1,2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

High Glycemic Index (GI) foods lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, which can exacerbate the complications of diabetes.  This is a well-established fact in diabetes management.  Option 2 is therefore correct.

High GI foods have no direct link to haemophilia. Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder unrelated to dietary glycemic index. Option 1 is incorrect.

Low GI foods, in contrast to high GI foods, lead to slower, more gradual increases in blood sugar, which is beneficial for managing diabetes. However, the statement that low GI foods prevent diabetes is inaccurate.  Option 3 is incorrect because it implies a causal relationship that isn't entirely accurate.  While beneficial, low GI foods are part of a broader management strategy for diabetes, not a guaranteed preventative measure.

Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question assesses the understanding of the relationship between dietary glycemic index and its impact on specific diseases.

   Initiative                       Focus Area
1.  WHO vaccine list             :  Inclusion of Malaria Vaccines
2.  International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) : Classification of Malaria
3.  National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) :  Malaria Prevention and Control in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The WHO vaccine list includes approved malaria vaccines.  ICD-11, the international standard for disease classification, includes malaria. NVBDCP is the Indian government's program to control vector-borne diseases, including malaria.  The options test the candidate's understanding of the organizational and programmatic aspects of malaria control at international and national levels. Selecting an option other than (c) would indicate a lack of understanding of the roles of WHO, ICD, and NVBDCP in malaria control.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Parasite Species            Malaria Type
1. Plasmodium falciparum      :  Severe Malaria
2. Plasmodium vivax           :  Benign Tertian Malaria
3. Plasmodium malariae         :  Quartan Malaria
4. Plasmodium ovale           :  Ovale Malaria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1,2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  *Plasmodium falciparum* is known to cause severe malaria, *Plasmodium vivax* causes benign tertian malaria, *Plasmodium malariae* causes quartan malaria, and *Plasmodium ovale* causes ovale malaria. This question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of malaria parasitology. The options are designed to test the precise knowledge of the various Plasmodium species and the types of malaria they cause. Incorrect options exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Disease                       Treatment/Drug
1. Tuberculosis                 :   P-aminosalicylic acid
2. Leprosy                      :   Rifampicin
3. Sickle Cell Anaemia          :   Bone marrow transplant


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

P-aminosalicylic acid and Rifampicin are indeed used in the treatment of Tuberculosis and Leprosy respectively.  While P-aminosalicylic acid is an older drug used in combination therapy for tuberculosis, Rifampicin is a key component of multi-drug therapy for leprosy.  Bone marrow transplant is currently considered the only curative option for Sickle Cell Anemia, offering a potential for a complete cure by replacing the affected bone marrow with healthy cells that produce normal hemoglobin. Option (a) is incorrect because, although P-aminosalicylic acid is used in TB treatment, it's not the sole or primary treatment. Option (b) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pairing. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Tuberculosis and P-aminosalicylic acid as the primary treatment.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Chemical Compound             Effect/Use
1. DDT                         :   Used as a defoliant in the Vietnam War
2. Dioxin                       :   Byproduct of plastic manufacturing
3. Isoniazid                    :   Treatment for both Tuberculosis and Leprosy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

DDT was infamously used as an insecticide and defoliant during the Vietnam War, leading to significant environmental and health consequences. Dioxin is a byproduct of various industrial processes, including plastic manufacturing, and is a highly toxic contaminant. Isoniazid is a primary drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis, but it is not effective against leprosy. Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either include only one correct pair or incorrectly include the pairing of Isoniazid with both Tuberculosis and Leprosy treatment.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Disease                       Mode of Transmission/Characteristic
1. Polio                        :   Faecal-oral route
2. Leprosy                      :   Droplet transmission
3. AIDS                         :   Transmitted through breast milk


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Polio is primarily transmitted through the faecal-oral route, meaning it spreads through contaminated food and water. Leprosy is spread through droplet transmission from the nose and mouth of infected individuals.  AIDS can be transmitted through various bodily fluids, including breast milk from an infected mother to her child. All three pairs accurately reflect the transmission methods or key characteristics of the diseases.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Genetic Condition             Mode of Inheritance/Characteristic
1. Phenylketonuria            :   Inherited lack of an enzyme
2. Haemophilia                 :   Sex-linked inheritance
3. Sickle Cell Anaemia          :   Recessive gene expression on an autosome


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by the inherited lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Haemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder, meaning the gene responsible is located on the X chromosome. Sickle cell anaemia results from the expression of a recessive gene located on an autosome, a non-sex chromosome.  All three pairs accurately describe the genetic basis of the respective conditions.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Medical Text                   Disease Mentioned
1. Charakasamhita              :   Tuberculosis
2. Sushruta Samhita             :   Leprosy
3.  National Strategic Plan (NSP) & Roadmap for Leprosy (2023-27) :   Tuberculosis


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic text, contains descriptions of diseases that align with the symptoms of tuberculosis.  The Sushruta Samhita, another ancient Indian medical text, includes descriptions of leprosy. The National Strategic Plan (NSP) & Roadmap for Leprosy (2023-27) is a government initiative focused on leprosy eradication, not tuberculosis.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correct pairings or include incorrect ones.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Disease                     Causative Agent
1. Malaria                    :  Anopheles mosquito bite
2. Diarrhoea                  :  Arsenic contamination
3. Haemophilia                :  X chromosome abnormality


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Malaria is indeed caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.  Arsenic contamination of water sources is a well-established cause of diarrhoea.  Haemophilia is a genetic disorder linked to the X chromosome;  specifically, mutations in genes responsible for producing clotting factors VIII (Haemophilia A) or IX (Haemophilia B) located on the X chromosome lead to this condition. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Disease                     Mode of Transmission/Cause
1. Botulism                  : Water-borne intoxication
2. Malaria                     : Plasmodium vivax parasite
3. Diarrhoea                  : Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Botulism is a foodborne intoxication, not a waterborne one, caused by the neurotoxin produced by *Clostridium botulinum*.  Malaria is correctly paired with *Plasmodium vivax* as one of its causative parasites.  ORT is a treatment for diarrhoea, not its cause or mode of transmission.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Disease                      Treatment/Prevention
1. Malaria                     : RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) vaccine
2. Diabetes Mellitus           : Fenugreek seeds
3. AIDS                         : Ionizing radiation avoidance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) is a malaria vaccine, although its efficacy is limited. Fenugreek seeds have been traditionally used to help manage blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes mellitus.  Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to increase susceptibility to various cancers and infections, including opportunistic infections common in AIDS patients. Therefore, all three pairs show a correct relationship between the disease and a measure for treatment or prevention. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Technique/Concept             Field of Application
1. Genetic Engineering        : Creation of GMOs
2. Gene Drive Technology      : Malaria control
3. Tissue Culture              : Plant propagation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Genetic engineering is a core technology used in creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Gene drive technology is being explored as a potential method for controlling the spread of malaria by modifying mosquito populations. Tissue culture is a widely used technique in plant propagation, allowing for the mass production of plants from small tissue samples. Hence, all three pairs are accurately matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Medical Term/Concept         Associated Field/Application
1. Jumping Genes              : Barbara McClintock's discovery
2. Piezoelectric effect       : Ultrasound technology
3.  Sulpha drug                : Antibacterial medication


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Barbara McClintock's research led to the discovery of "jumping genes" (transposable elements). The piezoelectric effect is the fundamental principle behind ultrasound technology, where mechanical pressure is converted into electrical signals and vice versa. Sulpha drugs are a class of antibacterial medications. All three pairs demonstrate a correct association.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Biological Entity             Characteristic/Association
1.  Plasmodium falciparum    :  Causes Malaria
2.  X chromosome              : Carries Haemophilia gene
3.  Anopheles stephensi       : Malaria vector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

*Plasmodium falciparum* is a species of Plasmodium parasite that causes a particularly severe form of malaria. The X chromosome is indeed linked to the inheritance of haemophilia. *Anopheles stephensi* is a species of mosquito that serves as a vector for malaria transmission. All three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Program/Initiative           Focus Area
1. NVBDCP                     : Malaria control
2. Millennium Development Goals : Malaria eradication
3. WHO vaccine list             : Inclusion of Malaria vaccines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) in India focuses significantly on malaria control. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) included targets for reducing the burden of malaria globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a list of prequalified vaccines, which includes malaria vaccines.  All three pairs are correctly matched; therefore, option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                     Transmission Route
    1. Polio                       :   Mosquito bite
    2. Hepatitis B                 :   Faecal-oral route
    3. Malaria                     :   Blood transfusion
    4. Plague                      :   Contact with infected rodents

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Polio is primarily transmitted through the faecal-oral route, not mosquito bites. Hepatitis B can be transmitted through various routes, including blood transfusion and contact with infected bodily fluids, but not primarily through the faecal-oral route. Malaria is transmitted through mosquito bites, not blood transfusions (although blood transfusions can be a route of transmission in some cases, it's not the primary vector). Plague is transmitted through contact with infected rodents or their fleas, making option 4 correct.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various disease transmission mechanisms.  Distractors are included to challenge the examinee's knowledge of disease vectors and routes of transmission, emphasizing the need for precise understanding and avoiding generalizations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                          Treatment/Vaccine
    1. Polio                           :  RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix)
    2. Malaria                         :  Oral polio vaccine (OPV)
    3. Hepatitis B                     :  Engerix-B
    4. Tuberculosis (TB)              : Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is used for Polio, not Malaria. RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) and R21/Matrix-M are malaria vaccines.  Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is a treatment for dehydration, often associated with diarrheal diseases, not a treatment for Tuberculosis. Engerix-B is a vaccine for Hepatitis B, making option 3 the only correctly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific disease treatments and vaccines, requiring precise factual recall to differentiate between closely related medical interventions. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the specific applications of different vaccines and therapies.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Event/Disease Category           Disease
    1. Rare Diseases                  :   Plague
    2. Zoonotic disease               :   AIDS
    3.  Millennium Development Goals :   Malaria
    4.  Indian Government Notifications:   Polio

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Plague is a zoonotic disease, not exclusively a rare disease.  AIDS is not directly a zoonotic disease in the sense that it is not directly transmitted from animals to humans.  The Millennium Development Goals included Malaria as a major health challenge. Polio has been the subject of numerous Indian government notifications regarding vaccination campaigns and eradication efforts. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's ability to categorize diseases and link them to relevant initiatives and classifications, requiring a nuanced understanding of public health terminology and global health programs.  The distractors test knowledge of disease categories and the goals of major global health initiatives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Person/Organization               Event/Disease
    1. Bal Gangadhar Tilak           :   AIDS
    2. Centre (Indian Government)    :   Plague
    3. Muhammad Tughlaq's army      :   Malaria
    4. WHO                           :   Hepatitis B


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Bal Gangadhar Tilak's activism was primarily focused on the Indian independence movement and the plague, not AIDS.  The Indian government has issued notifications on various diseases, including AIDS and Polio, but not specifically on Plague as a primary focus of a single notification. The WHO deals with a wide range of diseases, including Hepatitis B, but is not solely associated with it.  However, Muhammad Tughlaq's army was significantly affected by the bubonic plague, making option 3 the only correct match. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of historical events and the roles of various organizations in public health, demanding precise factual recall and the ability to connect historical figures with relevant events. The distractors utilize prominent figures and organizations to test the candidate's ability to filter out irrelevant associations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Vector/Causative Agent       Disease
    1. Plasmodium vivax           :   Hepatitis B
    2. Anopheles Stephensi        :   Polio
    3.  Bacteria                   :   Malaria
    4. Virus                       :   Plague


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Plasmodium vivax is a parasite that causes malaria, not Hepatitis B. Anopheles Stephensi is a mosquito that transmits malaria, not polio. Bacteria can cause various diseases, including plague, but not malaria (which is caused by Plasmodium). Viruses cause various diseases, including Hepatitis B, but not plague (which is caused by bacteria). Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests detailed knowledge of disease vectors and causative agents, demanding precise recall of biological facts and differentiating between various pathogens. The distractors are carefully selected to test the candidate's understanding of the specific agents responsible for each disease.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission                                      Launch Vehicle
1. Chandrayaan-3                                   :   PSLV C57
2. Aditya-L1                                        :   GSLV Mk III
3. Gaganyaan (Planned)                             :   LVM3
4. SLIM (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon)     :   Epsilon

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 was indeed launched using the PSLV C57 rocket.  Aditya-L1, however, was launched using the PSLV C57, not the GSLV Mk III. The Gaganyaan mission is planned to utilize the LVM3 (Launch Vehicle Mark-III) for its human spaceflight endeavors.  The SLIM mission was launched using the Epsilon rocket, not GSLV Mk III. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly pair missions with their launch vehicles, showcasing plausible distractors that require a precise knowledge of Indian space missions and their associated launch vehicles.  This question tests factual recall and demands precise knowledge of Indian space program details.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Satellite                                     Primary Function/Observation
1. XPoSAT                                     :   Study of X-ray polarization
2. Aryabhatta                                  :   Earth resources observation
3. GSAT-8, GSAT-10, GSAT-15               :   GAGAN payload carriers
4. Euclid Space Telescope                     :   Mapping the universe's dark matter

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

XPoSAT's primary mission was focused on the study of X-ray polarization from celestial sources.  Aryabhatta, India's first satellite, was primarily an experimental satellite for technological demonstration, not dedicated to earth resources observation.  The GSAT series of satellites mentioned are integral to the GAGAN (GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation) system, carrying payloads crucial for its operation. The Euclid Space Telescope's core objective is to create a three-dimensional map of the universe, focusing on dark matter and dark energy. Thus, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of Aryabhatta as a distractor highlights the need for precise knowledge of specific satellite missions and their functions. This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to differentiate between related but distinct satellite functionalities.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Atmospheric Layer                                 Characteristic
1. Ionosphere                                      :   Reflects radio waves
2. Thermosphere                                     :   Contains the Ionosphere
3. Exosphere                                       :   Highest atmospheric layer
4. Stratosphere                                    :   Ozone layer concentration

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The ionosphere's charged particles effectively reflect radio waves, enabling long-distance radio communication.  The thermosphere encompasses the ionosphere, making this a correct pairing. The exosphere is indeed the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere. The stratosphere is predominantly known for its ozone layer, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. This question primarily tests factual recall related to atmospheric layers and their properties. The inclusion of all correct pairs raises the difficulty by requiring comprehensive knowledge of atmospheric science.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Device                              Application/Function
1. Modem                                           :   Data transfer over telephone lines
2. Luxmeter                                        :   Measures blood pressure
3. Caratometer                                     :   Measures intensity of light
4. Sphygmomanometer                               :   Measures heart sounds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Modems are devices that modulate and demodulate signals, enabling data transfer over telephone lines using binary signals.  A luxmeter measures light intensity, not blood pressure.  A caratometer measures the weight of gemstones, not light intensity.  A sphygmomanometer measures blood pressure, not heart sounds; a stethoscope is used for that. Thus, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The inclusion of closely related but incorrect instruments as distractors (luxmeter, caratometer, sphygmomanometer) significantly increases the question's difficulty, demanding precise knowledge of scientific instruments and their functions. This question tests factual recall and analytical skills.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                         Deficiency
1. Goitre                                          :   Iron deficiency
2. Scurvy                                          :   Vitamin C deficiency
3. Anaemia                                         :   Iodine deficiency
4. Khaira                                          :   Zinc deficiency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Scurvy is indeed caused by Vitamin C deficiency. However, goitre is caused by iodine deficiency, not iron. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency, but not exclusively, and is not solely linked to iodine deficiency. Khaira disease is associated with zinc deficiency in rice-eating populations. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The incorrect pairings represent plausible distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of nutritional deficiencies and their associated diseases. This question tests factual recall and requires a nuanced understanding of the causes of various diseases.  The distractors are carefully chosen to challenge even those with some knowledge of the subject.

**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                     Fuel Type
1. PSLV                                          :   Solid fuel only
2. GSLV                                          :   Liquid fuel only
3. Vikas Engine                                   :   Solid and liquid fuel
4. CE-20 Cryogenic Engine                       :   Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) utilizes primarily solid propellants, although some stages might incorporate liquid propellants.  The GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle) uses both solid and liquid propellants, including cryogenic stages in some versions. The Vikas engine, a family of engines, is predominantly liquid-fueled. The CE-20 cryogenic engine specifically uses Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are accurately matched. The other options misrepresent the fuel types used in different rocket technologies. This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between specific rocket technologies and their fuel sources. The inclusion of closely related but incorrect fuel types acts as a strong distractor.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology                             Imaging Target
1. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)          :   Brain
2. PET (Positron Emission Tomography)        :   Bones
3. CT (Computed Tomography)                   :   Soft tissues
4. X-ray                                        :   Internal organs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

MRI is a powerful tool for imaging soft tissues, including the brain.  PET scans are not primarily used for bone imaging; they are better suited for metabolic activity. CT scans are indeed excellent for visualizing soft tissues and internal organs. X-rays, while used for internal organs, are not the primary imaging modality for soft tissues. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of other medical imaging techniques as distractors tests the candidate's knowledge of their respective applications. The question tests factual recall and understanding of medical imaging principles.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                           Disease Combatted
1. Millets                                        :   Anaemia
2. Rice                                           :   Beriberi
3. Wheat                                          :   Pellagra
4. Pulses                                         :   Kwashiorkor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

While millets are nutritious and contribute to overall health, they are not specifically linked to anaemia prevention in the same way as iron-rich foods.  Beriberi is directly linked to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency commonly associated with polished rice.  Pellagra results from niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, often linked to diets primarily based on maize (corn), which is less rich in niacin than other grains. Kwashiorkor is a severe form of malnutrition primarily caused by protein deficiency. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The incorrect pairings act as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of nutritional deficiencies and their associated crops. This question tests factual recall and requires a nuanced understanding of nutritional deficiencies and their associated diseases and crops.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Technique                       Application
1. Genetic Engineering                         :   Disease Resistance in Crops
2. Gene Drive Technology                        :   Animal Cloning
3. CRISPR-Cas9                                :   Genome Editing
4. Recombinant DNA Technology                  :   Bioremediation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Genetic engineering is indeed used to enhance disease resistance in crops through the introduction of specific genes.  Gene drive technology is a specific form of genetic engineering but is not primarily used for animal cloning; it aims to spread specific genes within a population. CRISPR-Cas9 is a highly precise gene-editing tool. Recombinant DNA technology is widely used in bioremediation processes.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of Gene Drive Technology as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances within genetic engineering. This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various biotechnology techniques and their applications.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Individual                       Contribution/Association
1. ISRO                                          :   Development of PSLV
2. Aryabhatta                                  :   Author of Surya Siddhanta
3. Nalanda University                           :   Aryabhata's studies
4. Vikas Engine                                  :   Powered by PSLV and GSLV

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) is responsible for the development and launch of the PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle). Aryabhata was a renowned mathematician and astronomer, but the authorship of Surya Siddhanta is debated and not definitively attributed to him.  Nalanda University is historically linked to Aryabhata's studies. The Vikas engine powers both PSLV and GSLV rockets. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The incorrect pairing of Aryabhata with Surya Siddhanta serves as a plausible distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of historical figures and their contributions. This question tests factual recall, requiring knowledge of Indian space program history and the contributions of historical figures.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Editing Technique                     Associated Technology/Method
1. SDN 1                                      :   Involves alien genetic material
2. CRISPR-Cas9                               :   Site-directed nuclease (SDN)
3. Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs)            :   Modification of existing genetic material
4. Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) :  Gene silencing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

SDN 1, and SDN 2, by definition, do *not* involve alien genetic material; therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a type of site-directed nuclease (SDN), making pair 2 correct.  Both ZFNs and TALENs are also types of site-directed nucleases used in gene editing, and they operate by modifying existing genetic material, making pair 3 correct.  While gene editing techniques *can* be used for gene silencing, it's not their primary or exclusive function; therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the relationship between the gene editing technique and its associated technology or method.  Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetically Modified Crop                  Characteristic
1. Bt Cotton                                  :   Contains Cry2Ai gene for pink bollworm resistance
2. Bt Brinjal                                 :   Approved for commercial cultivation in India
3. GM Mustard (DMH-11)                     :   Derived from Bacillus thuringiensis genes
4.  Canola                                    : Contains high glucosinolates

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bt cotton is known to contain the Cry1Ac gene, and recently research is being done on Cry2Ai to improve its resistance against pink bollworm. Hence, pair 1 is partially correct.  Bt brinjal was *not* approved for commercial cultivation in India due to concerns. Pair 2 is incorrect. GM mustard (DMH-11) contains genes from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*, not Bacillus thuringiensis. Pair 3 is incorrect. Canola is known for its *low* glucosinolate content, a key factor in its widespread use. Pair 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 1 has a partially correct relationship.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Genome Sequencing Technique             Characteristic
1. Short-read sequencing                      :   Better for assembling complex genomes like the Y chromosome
2. Long-read sequencing                       :  Fragments genome into small pieces (50-300 bases)
3. Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) sequencing  :  Sequenced 92% of human genome in the Human Genome Project
4. Genome India Project (GIP)                : Aims to sequence 10,000 human genomes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Short-read sequencing is better suited for applications requiring high throughput and is less effective for assembling complex, repetitive genomes.  Pair 1 is incorrect. Long-read sequencing is characterized by its ability to sequence longer DNA fragments, making it advantageous for resolving complex genomic regions. Pair 2 is incorrect. The Human Genome Project, while a landmark achievement, initially sequenced approximately 92% of the human genome. The T2T consortium completed the full 100% sequencing. Pair 3 is incorrect. The Genome India Project (GIP) indeed aims to sequence 10,000 human genomes, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Biotechnology Application                 Description
1. Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)          : Treats congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP)
2.  Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT) : Involves only two parents’ DNA
3. Gene Drive Technology (GDT)             : Modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance
4.  Recombinant DNA technology              :  Primarily used in plant breeding


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

ERT, using recombinant proteins, is indeed used to treat cTTP, making pair 1 correct. MDT utilizes genetic material from three individuals (parents and a mitochondrial donor), not just two. Pair 2 is incorrect. GDT does modify genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, making pair 3 correct. Recombinant DNA technology has applications beyond plant breeding, including medicine and other fields. Pair 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of RNA                                     Function
1. Messenger RNA (mRNA)                         : Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis
2. Transfer RNA (tRNA)                           :  Involved in RNA interference (RNAi) pathway
3. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)                          :  Forms structural and catalytic components of ribosomes
4. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)                 :   Carries amino acids to ribosomes during translation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

mRNA's primary function is to carry genetic information transcribed from DNA to the ribosomes, where it directs protein synthesis.  Pair 1 is correct. tRNA's crucial role is to deliver specific amino acids to the ribosomes during translation, based on the mRNA codons. Pair 4 is incorrect. rRNA constitutes the structural and catalytic core of ribosomes, essential for protein synthesis. Pair 3 is correct. siRNAs are involved in the RNA interference pathway, triggering mRNA degradation or translational repression. Pair 2 is incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are accurately matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Reactor Type                     Key Feature
1. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) : Uses liquid sodium coolant
2. Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)            :  Breeds more fissile material than consumed
3. Thorium Reactor                         : Primarily uses Uranium-233 as fuel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) are indeed designed to breed more fissile material than they consume, a key feature that distinguishes them from other reactor types.  This characteristic is crucial for improving fuel efficiency and reducing reliance on uranium resources.  The other pairs are incorrect. PHWRs utilize heavy water as a moderator and coolant, not liquid sodium, which is a characteristic of some FBR designs.  While thorium reactors utilize thorium, their primary fuel is actually Uranium-233, produced from the thorium.  The use of Uranium-233 is a consequence of thorium's conversion into a fissile material through neutron absorption.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Therapy Application              Specific Disease Treated
1. CRISPR technology                     : Haemophilia A
2. Lentiviral vector                       : Sickle Cell Anemia
3.  FVIII transgene                        : Cystic Fibrosis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. CRISPR technology, a powerful genome editing tool, is used in gene therapy to correct genetic defects that cause diseases like Haemophilia A.  The other pairs are incorrect. Lentiviral vectors are indeed used as delivery systems in gene therapy, but they are not specifically linked to Sickle Cell Anemia;  multiple vector types are used for various genetic diseases.  Similarly, FVIII transgene is used in gene therapy for Haemophilia A, not Cystic Fibrosis, which involves different genetic mutations and therapeutic approaches.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Missile Type                              Characteristic
1. BrahMos                               : Hypersonic speed
2. Agni Prime                             : Submarine-launched ballistic missile
3. Dhanush                               : Cruise missile


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the second and third pairs are correctly matched.  The Agni Prime is indeed a short-range ballistic missile, and the Dhanush is a short-range, land-based ballistic missile, not a cruise missile. The BrahMos missile, while a supersonic cruise missile, does not possess hypersonic speed. Hypersonic missiles are a separate category with significantly higher speeds.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                 Application in Defence
1.  HAPS (High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite)   :  Surveillance
2.  AIP (Air Independent Propulsion)          :  Submarine propulsion
3.  SMART (Supersonic Missile-Assisted Release of Torpedo) : Anti-tank guided missile


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first two pairs are correctly matched. HAPS (High Altitude Pseudo-Satellites) are indeed used for long-endurance surveillance, offering persistent observation capabilities. AIP (Air Independent Propulsion) systems allow submarines to remain submerged for extended periods without needing to surface for air, a critical advantage in naval operations. The third pair is incorrect; SMART is a system for launching torpedoes from supersonic missiles, not an anti-tank guided missile.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Radioactive Isotope                    Application in Medicine
1. Cobalt-60                             :  Radiation therapy
2. Calcium-41                            : Bone density scans
3.  Molybdenum-99                       : Nuclear medicine imaging


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Cobalt-60 is widely used in radiation therapy to target cancerous cells.  Molybdenum-99 is a crucial isotope in nuclear medicine, used to produce technetium-99m, a key component in various imaging techniques. Calcium-41, while a radioactive isotope, is not commonly used in bone density scans; other techniques like DEXA scans are more prevalent.  Therefore, only the first and third pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                             Activity/Focus
1.  CERT-In                               :  Monitors cybersecurity incidents
2.  DRDO                                  : Developed the BrahMos missile
3.  Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) :  Primarily focuses on space exploration

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) is responsible for monitoring and responding to cybersecurity incidents within India's digital infrastructure.  DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) is the primary agency responsible for the development of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile.  The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) focuses on nuclear research and development, not space exploration; that falls under ISRO's purview.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                     Treatment/Prevention
1. Tuberculosis (TB)                         :  BCG vaccine
2. Diabetes                                  : Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
3. Sickle Cell Anemia                       :  Gene Therapy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The BCG vaccine is used for the prevention of tuberculosis. Gene therapy is a promising treatment approach for sickle cell anemia. Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is primarily used for treating dehydration, often associated with diarrheal diseases, not diabetes management, which involves a different set of treatments including insulin therapy, dietary control, and lifestyle modifications. Therefore, only the first and third pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Procedure                         Technology/Technique
1. Radiation Therapy                         :  Cobalt-60
2.  Gene Therapy                             :  CRISPR technology
3. CAR T-cell Therapy                       :  Stem cell transplantation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope commonly used as a source of gamma radiation in radiation therapy. CRISPR technology is a powerful genome editing tool used in gene therapy to modify genes involved in various diseases.  CAR T-cell therapy does not directly involve stem cell transplantation; stem cells are used in other therapies.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched.  CAR T-cell therapy involves re-engineering a patient's own T-cells to target cancer cells.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                       Transmission Method
1. COVID-19                                   :   Aerosol droplets
2. Tuberculosis                               :   Airborne droplets
3. HIV/AIDS                                  :   Bodily fluids
4. Cholera                                    :   Contaminated water
5. Malaria                                   :   Mosquito bite


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  Tuberculosis is also spread through airborne droplets expelled by an infected individual when they cough, sneeze, speak, or sing.  HIV/AIDS, however, is transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, primarily blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Cholera is a waterborne disease caused by ingesting contaminated water or food. Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.  All the pairs listed are correctly matched based on the established scientific understanding of disease transmission. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative/Program          Focus Area
1. INSPIRE                                 :   Science and Technology Research
2. NTEP                                    :   Tuberculosis Control

   Biological Entity/Process           Characteristic/Function
1. Stem cells                          :    Found only in embryos
2.  Lentiviruses                       :    Used in gene therapy
3.  Gene silencing                     :   Always irreversible


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The statement that stem cells are found *only* in embryos is incorrect. While embryonic stem cells are a significant type, adult stem cells are also present in various tissues throughout the body, capable of self-renewal and differentiation.

Lentiviruses are retroviruses that can integrate their genetic material into the host cell's genome, making them effective vectors for gene therapy.  This makes the pair a correct match.

Gene silencing, a process of regulating gene expression, is often *reversible*.  While some forms can be relatively permanent, epigenetic modifications (like DNA methylation) are often reversible, affecting gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself.  Thus, this pair is incorrect.  Only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative             Area of Focus
1. ISRO                                 :   Development of  cryogenic engines
2.  CSIR-CCMB                         :   Epigenetic epidemiology research
3.  ICMR                               :   Development of COVID-19 vaccines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) has a significant program focused on developing and mastering cryogenic engine technology for its launch vehicles.  This is crucial for achieving greater payload capacity and accessing higher orbits.  Therefore, this pair is correctly matched.

CSIR-CCMB (Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology) is actively involved in research related to epigenetics and its implications for human health and disease.  Their participation in the DEEP project underscores their commitment to this area.  Thus, this is correctly matched.

While ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) plays a crucial role in medical research in India, its primary focus isn't vaccine development.  It coordinates and supports various research initiatives, but vaccine development is typically undertaken by other institutions or in collaboration with various organizations.  Therefore, this pair is not correctly matched. Options (a) and (b) are plausible distractors, but only (b) is entirely correct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Genetically Modified Crop         Specific Genetic Modification
1. Bt Cotton                         :   Herbicide tolerance
2.  GM Mustard                       :   Male sterility for hybrid seed production
3.  Bollgard II Bt Cotton              :    Resistance to lepidopteran pests


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bt cotton is primarily engineered for pest resistance, not herbicide tolerance. Herbicide tolerance is a separate genetic modification often stacked with Bt traits (as seen in HT Bt cotton), but it isn't the defining feature of Bt cotton itself.

GM mustard, specifically the DMH-11 variety, incorporates a barnase-barstar system to induce male sterility in one parent line, facilitating hybrid seed production. This is a key characteristic of this GM crop.

Bollgard II cotton is designed with stacked genes (Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab) to provide broader resistance against a wider range of lepidopteran (moth and butterfly) pests, enhancing its effectiveness compared to earlier generations of Bt cotton. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is a plausible distractor, but it is incorrect.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                     Location/Source
1. Cyanide                               :   Northern and Eastern India
2. Sulfuric Acid                           :   Venus's atmosphere
3. Phosphine                               :   Venus's atmosphere
4. Glucosinolates                         :  Indian Mustard (Brassica juncea)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Cyanide is a byproduct of the coking process and is associated with mustard oil production in Northern and Eastern India, where traditional methods may sometimes lead to contamination.  Sulfuric acid is a major component of Venus's dense atmosphere, contributing to its extreme greenhouse effect.  Phosphine has been detected in Venus's atmosphere, although its origin remains a subject of scientific investigation. Glucosinolates are naturally occurring compounds found in high concentrations in Indian Mustard. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes cyanide, ignoring the correct pairings of sulfuric acid and phosphine with their respective locations. Option (b) is partially correct regarding cyanide and sulfuric acid but omits the correct pairing of phosphine and its location. Option (c) correctly links sulfuric acid and phosphine to Venus but ignores the correct association of cyanide with mustard oil production regions.  Therefore, only option (d) encompasses all the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organ                                  Characteristic/Association
1. Liver                                  :   Affected by Hepatitis A
2. Kidney                                 :   Albumin release in urine indicates potential failure
3. Heart                                  :   Located in Afghanistan (Incorrect)
4. Spleen                                 :   Source of donation from living donors (Incorrect)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease, making the first pair correct.  The presence of albumin in urine (albuminuria) is a key indicator of kidney damage or failure, hence the second pair is also correct.  The third and fourth pairs are incorrect.  The heart's geographical location is not specific to Afghanistan; it's a vital organ found in all mammals. While living organ donation is possible, the spleen is not commonly donated from living donors compared to the liver or kidney, making the fourth pair factually wrong. Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Celestial Object/Phenomenon          Characteristic/Property
1. Black Hole                             :   Located in the Milky Way Galaxy
2. Black Hole                             :   Mediated by Gravitational Lensing
3. Venus                                  :   Retrograde Rotation
4. Earth                                   :   Nearest planetary neighbor to Venus

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Black holes are indeed found within the Milky Way Galaxy, confirming the first pair.  Black holes significantly influence gravitational lensing, a phenomenon where light bends around massive objects.  Venus is known for its unique retrograde rotation, spinning in the opposite direction to most other planets. Earth is the closest planet to Venus. All the pairs are correctly matched. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Spacecraft/Mission                     Target Planet
1. VERITAS                               :   Venus
2. DAVINCI                               :   Venus
3. Mariner 2                             :   Venus
4.  Juno                                  :   Jupiter (Incorrect)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

VERITAS and DAVINCI are both NASA missions specifically designed to study Venus.  Mariner 2 was a historical mission that also targeted Venus.  The Juno mission, however, focuses on Jupiter.  Therefore, only the first three pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes Juno, which is a mission to Jupiter, not Venus.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Location                                 Significance
1. Kakrapar                              :   Nuclear Power Plant
2. Pokhran                                :   Nuclear Test Site
3. Thumba                                 :   Rocket Launching Centre
4. Sriharikota                             :   Satellite Launching Station

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kakrapar is the site of a significant nuclear power plant in India. Pokhran is renowned for its history as a nuclear test site. Thumba is a historically important location for India's early rocket launching programs. Sriharikota houses the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, a major satellite launching facility.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/System                     Type of Communication
1. Television Transmission             :   Simplex Communication (Incorrect)
2. Email                                :   Full-duplex Communication (Incorrect)
3. Internet                              :  Network of Networks
4.  Extranet                             : Network of Networks (Incorrect)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Television transmission is not simplex (one-way) communication; it's a more complex system. Email typically allows for two-way communication but not simultaneously. The Internet is fundamentally a network of networks.  Extranet is a type of network, but not a network of networks in the same sense as the Internet. Therefore, only the statement about the Internet is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Causative Agent                         Disease/Condition
1. E. coli                                 :   Food Poisoning
2. Salmonella bacilli                     :   Food Poisoning
3. Pseudomonas                           :   Food Poisoning
4. Candida                               :   Food Poisoning (Incorrect)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

*E. coli*, *Salmonella bacilli*, and *Pseudomonas* are all bacteria known to cause food poisoning under certain conditions.  Candida, however, is a type of yeast and is more commonly associated with fungal infections rather than food poisoning.  Therefore, only the first three pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Term/Concept                  Description/Association
1. AIDS                                  :   Immune system affected
2. T-lymphocytes                         :   Completely damaged in AIDS
3.  Hepatitis A                           :   Affects the Liver
4. Albuminuria                           : Indicates Kidney Failure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

AIDS severely compromises the immune system.  T-lymphocytes are crucial immune cells that are significantly depleted in AIDS. Hepatitis A primarily affects the liver. Albuminuria (albumin in the urine) is a sign of kidney dysfunction.  All four pairs are correctly matched.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune Cell Type                    Primary Function
1. B Lymphocytes                     :     Kill virally infected cells
2. Cytotoxic T cells                  :     Produce antibodies
3. Natural Killer (NK) cells          :     Mediate cellular immunity
4. Helper T cells                      :     Regulate immune response
5. Regulatory T cells                 :     Assist in B cell activation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because Helper T cells (Th) are crucial in assisting the activation of B cells and cytotoxic T cells, initiating and coordinating the adaptive immune response.  Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing excessive immune responses and preventing autoimmunity.  These are their primary functions.  The other options are incorrect. B lymphocytes primarily produce antibodies, not directly kill infected cells. That is the function of cytotoxic T cells. Natural Killer cells, indeed, are part of the innate immune system and kill infected or cancerous cells without prior sensitization; they do not mediate cellular immunity in the same way as T cells. Therefore, only the pairing of Helper T cells with their assisting role and Regulatory T cells with their regulatory function are accurately matched.  The question tests factual recall of the basic functions of different immune cells, a crucial concept in immunology and frequently relevant in UPSC examinations relating to diseases and their treatments.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immunity Type                       Characteristic
1. Innate Immunity                   :     Develops after antigen exposure
2. Adaptive Immunity                 :     First line of defense
3. Passive Immunity                   :     Acquired through antibody transfer
4. Active Immunity                    :     Long-lasting, specific response
5. Natural Immunity                   :     Stimulated by vaccination


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Passive immunity is indeed acquired through the transfer of antibodies or activated T cells from an immune host, such as from mother to fetus. Active immunity is characterized by a long-lasting, specific response developed after exposure to an antigen, whether through infection or vaccination. The other options are incorrect because innate immunity is the body's first line of defense, not adaptive immunity.  Adaptive immunity develops after exposure to antigens, not innate immunity. Natural immunity is acquired through natural processes like infection, not vaccination which is a form of artificial immunity.  This question tests the understanding of different types of immunity and their mechanisms, a fundamental concept in immunology regularly assessed in the UPSC examination.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune Response                    Description
1. Humoral Immunity                 :     Mediated by T cells
2. Cellular Immunity                 :     Involves antibody production
3. Immunological Memory              :     Rapid, effective response to re-infection
4. Autoimmunity                     :     Immune response against self-antigens
5. Allergy                           :     Hypersensitivity to environmental antigens


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. Autoimmunity is correctly defined as an immune response directed against the body's own tissues and cells.  Allergy is accurately described as a hypersensitivity reaction to environmental antigens. The other options are incorrect. Humoral immunity is mediated by antibodies produced by B cells, not T cells. Cellular immunity is primarily mediated by T cells, not antibodies. Immunological memory is the ability of the immune system to mount a faster and stronger response upon secondary exposure to a pathogen, which is true but not the primary definition. This question assesses the understanding of different immune responses and disorders, a crucial topic for the UPSC examination.  The distractors involve switching the definitions of humoral and cellular immunity, a common area of confusion for candidates.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vaccine Type                      Mechanism of Action
1. mRNA Vaccine                     :     Uses weakened or killed pathogens
2. Conventional Vaccine             :     Introduces mRNA to produce viral proteins
3. DNA Vaccine                       :     Introduces plasmid DNA to produce viral proteins
4. Hepatitis A Vaccine              :     Provides lifelong immunity against infection
5. Hepatitis C Vaccine              :     Currently unavailable


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer. A DNA vaccine correctly uses plasmid DNA to produce viral proteins within the body's cells to trigger an immune response.  There is currently no licensed vaccine for Hepatitis C, making this statement true.  The other options are incorrect. mRNA vaccines do not use weakened or killed pathogens; they use mRNA to instruct cells to produce viral proteins.  Conventional vaccines typically use weakened or killed pathogens or their components.  While some vaccines provide long-lasting immunity, it is not necessarily lifelong for all vaccines, including the Hepatitis A vaccine. This question tests the knowledge of different vaccine types and their mechanisms, a very important topic for the UPSC given the increasing relevance of vaccines in public health. The distractors focus on common misconceptions regarding vaccine mechanisms and long-term efficacy.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                      Causative Agent
1. AIDS                                         :     Virus
2. Tuberculosis (TB)                             :     Bacteria
3. Lymphatic Filariasis (Elephantiasis)      :     Nematode worms
4. Malaria                                      :     Protozoa
5. Hepatitis C                                   :     Fungus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly matches AIDS with a virus (HIV), Tuberculosis with bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and Lymphatic Filariasis with nematode worms (filarial worms). Malaria is caused by Plasmodium protozoa.  The pairing of Hepatitis C with a fungus is incorrect; Hepatitis C is caused by a virus (Hepatitis C virus).  This question tests factual recall of the causative agents of several important diseases, a frequently examined area in the UPSC syllabus.  The distractors involve substituting the correct causative agents with closely related ones, or introducing a completely unrelated one (fungus in the case of Hepatitis C). The ability to correctly identify the causative agents is key to understanding disease transmission, prevention, and treatment strategies.

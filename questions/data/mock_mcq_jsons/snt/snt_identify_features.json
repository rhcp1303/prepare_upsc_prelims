Methanol, another alcohol, is highly toxic.\n\n3. **Mercury:** Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal released into the environment through various industrial activities. It bioaccumulates in the food chain, leading to serious health problems (Minamata disease) and ecosystem damage.\n\n4. **DDT:** DDT is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) known for its bioaccumulation and negative impacts on wildlife, particularly birds (eggshell thinning).  It's banned in many countries due to its persistent and harmful effects.\n\n5. **Carbon monoxide:** Carbon monoxide is a highly toxic gas that binds strongly to hemoglobin, preventing oxygen transport in the blood.  This leads to oxygen deprivation and can be fatal.\n\n\nAll five items have clear links to either environmental pollution, health risks, or both, making (d) the correct answer.  The inclusion of seemingly unrelated items (like liquid nitrogen's cryogenic use) serves as a distractor, emphasizing the need for precise understanding of each item's potential risks.\n"

This is a distractor.\n\n4. **SOFIA:**  SOFIA was a joint US-German project.  It's not directly associated with Indian space initiatives and serves as a distractor.\n\n5. **Artemis Accords:** While India has joined the Artemis Accords, the Accords themselves are an international initiative, not solely an Indian program.

Enzyme replacement therapy (4) does not directly manipulate genes; it provides missing or deficient enzymes. Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 involve genetic modification or manipulation.\n"

Ebola, with its high mortality rate and rapid spread, highlights the challenges of containing highly infectious diseases.  Malaria, a persistent global health challenge, provides insights into vector-borne disease control and the impact of climate change on disease transmission. Tuberculosis, a chronic infectious disease, demonstrates the complexities of managing long-term treatment and preventing drug resistance. Disease X, a hypothetical pathogen, underscores the importance of preparedness for novel and emerging infectious diseases and the need for flexible pandemic response mechanisms.  Thus, all four provide relevant comparative frameworks.\n"

While an epitope (3) is relevant to the broader field of immunology and drug design, its direct involvement in CAR-T cell therapy is not as central as the other elements. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) (4) is a known adverse effect of CAR-T cell therapy, highlighting the therapy's impact on the cytokine system. Lymphocytes (5), as a type of white blood cell, are fundamentally involved as T cells are lymphocytes.

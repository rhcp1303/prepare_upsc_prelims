        "explanation": "\n\nWater exhibits an anomalous expansion behavior. Its density increases as temperature decreases until it reaches 4\u00b0C, after which it decreases.  The dissolution of calcium carbonate is an endothermic process, meaning it requires energy (heat) to occur. Higher temperatures therefore increase the rate and extent of dissolution. The density of air, like most gases, is inversely proportional to temperature.  Higher temperatures lead to increased molecular kinetic energy and thus lower density. Salinity in seawater does not directly increase with temperature. While evaporation increases salinity, the relationship is indirect and complex, influenced by other factors like precipitation and mixing. The volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature (at constant pressure), according to Charles's Law.  Therefore, decreasing temperature causes a decrease in volume. Pairs 2, 3, and 5 accurately describe the relationship between the physical property and the effect of temperature change.\n"

Plutonium-239 is a fissile material used in nuclear weapons and some reactors, but its primary use is not specifically in SMRs.  While SMRs use nuclear fission, the fuel type can vary.  The SNAP-10A satellite used a reactor based on nuclear fission, but not specifically U-235 as its sole fuel.  Different isotopes can be used in various nuclear reactor designs.  Understanding the different applications of these isotopes in nuclear technology is vital to correctly answer this question.

Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 represent accurate matches based on well-established chemical properties.\n"

Bituminous coal, a common type, typically contains a moderate amount of sulfur, which is an environmental concern due to its contribution to acid rain when burned. Subbituminous coal has a lower heating value compared to bituminous coal because of its lower carbon content and higher moisture content. Lastly, lignite, also known as brown coal, possesses the highest moisture content among the coal types, leading to lower energy density and a less efficient burn. These characteristics are well-established in geology and energy science, making all four pairs factual and accurate.  The options strategically include combinations to test the candidate's thorough understanding of the properties of various coal types.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nFreshwater evaporates faster than saltwater due to the lower vapor pressure of saltwater caused by dissolved salts (1). A higher boiling point implies stronger intermolecular forces, making it harder for molecules to escape into the gaseous phase, thus lowering the evaporation rate (3). At the saturation point, the rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensation, resulting in a net zero evaporation rate (4). All these pairs accurately represent the relationships between the type of water and its evaporation rate.  Therefore, option (c) is correct.

The refractive index of water is greater than 1, indicating that light slows down when it passes from a vacuum to water.  Option 1 is therefore correct.\n\nEarth's magnetic field significantly influences bird migration. Many bird species possess a biological compass that allows them to sense and utilize the Earth's magnetic field for navigation during their long-distance migrations. This is a well-established fact in ornithology and biophysics. Option 2 is correct.\n\nSunlight is crucial for photosynthesis in phytoplankton, the microscopic plants that form the base of many aquatic food webs. Phytoplankton use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic matter, releasing oxygen in the process. This is a cornerstone of aquatic ecology. Option 3 is correct.\n\nCMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections) are powerful eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's corona.

Kerosene, while having its own uses, is unfortunately often used as an adulterant in gasoline and diesel fuel, reducing their quality and impacting engine performance. Biodiesel serves as a renewable and sustainable alternative to conventional diesel fuel, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

While gibberellins are involved in cell elongation and cytokinins play a role in cell division, the primary functions are not solely confined to these aspects; they also influence other aspects of plant growth and development.  Hence only the pairs related to auxin and abscisic acid accurately reflect the primary functions of these plant hormones.\n"

These storms can induce large currents in power transmission lines, leading to widespread blackouts.  Solar flares, while not as massive as CMEs, release intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation. While the radiation itself doesn't directly cause power outages, the associated geomagnetic disturbances can still disrupt power grids through induced currents.

Rajasthan is a known region in India for uranium mining. The Katanga Plateau in the Democratic Republic of Congo is historically significant for its substantial uranium reserves. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is correct as Australia holds significant Thorium reserves. However, pair 4 is a distractor because while uranium is found globally, the Katanga Plateau is known for its copper reserves as well as significant uranium deposits.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of these crucial atomic minerals, highlighting the strategic importance of these resources for various nations.  The inclusion of plausible yet incorrect options (like focusing on a specific region for uranium, when it's found globally) adds to the question's difficulty and assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between accurate and partially correct information."

Vaccination is a highly effective preventative measure against Hepatitis A.  Option (a) is incorrect because while gene drive technology *is* being explored as a potential tool for dengue control, it's not yet a widely implemented treatment or prevention strategy. Option (b) is partially correct;  improved workplace air quality through purification systems is a key preventative measure for pneumoconiosis. However, the inclusion of only 2 and 3 makes it incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate pairing of dengue with gene drive technology as a current strategy.  The question tests the understanding of established treatment and prevention strategies for various diseases, distinguishing between those currently in use and those under research.\n"

Option 1 is correct as Monsanto's Bt cotton technology has been a subject of contention and scrutiny by the Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers Rights (PPVFR) Authority, leading to various cases and proceedings. Option 2 is also correct; Monsanto has, in certain instances, obtained favorable rulings from the Supreme Court of India regarding its intellectual property rights and operations. Option 3 is correct because Monsanto has been involved in significant litigation with Indian companies like Nuziveedu Seeds, primarily centered on seed technology and patent disputes. Option 4 is partially correct in that Monsanto's operations in India would be indirectly impacted by the Essential Commodities Act 1955, which regulates the production, distribution, and pricing of essential commodities; however, this is a broader regulatory context and not a specific legal action. Option 5 is correct because the Delhi High Court has also been involved in cases concerning Monsanto's activities in India. Therefore, only options 1,2,3 and 5 are entirely and directly accurate.\n"

While Monsanto later sold its agricultural business, including the Bollgard brand, the initial development and introduction of Bt cotton seeds in India are firmly attributed to Monsanto.  Option 1 is incorrect; Bollgard-II is a later generation of Bt cotton, and while Monsanto played a role in its development, the current ownership and marketing might be different. Option 4 is incorrect as Mahyco (Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company) was involved in the development of Bt brinjal, though it faced significant opposition and regulatory hurdles.

Option 2 is correct as the Delhi High Court, in some instances, has indeed ruled in favor of Monsanto on specific legal matters. Option 5 is correct because the PPVFR Authority (Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers' Rights Authority) has been involved in cases concerning the approval and regulation of Monsanto's seed varieties, particularly Bt cotton. Option 1 is incorrect; while the Supreme Court has heard cases involving Monsanto, a blanket statement that it always ruled against them is an oversimplification.

Females can be carriers but typically do not exhibit the disease unless they inherit two affected X chromosomes. Option 1 is incorrect because it states autosomal recessive inheritance which is a different pattern of inheritance.\n\nDiabetes is a complex condition with genetic components, but its inheritance pattern is not solely through mitochondrial DNA.  While mitochondrial dysfunction can contribute to some forms of diabetes, the majority of cases are influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors. It is not a simple Mendelian inheritance pattern. Option 2 is incorrect because it oversimplifies the complex genetic basis of diabetes.\n\nSickle cell anemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning an individual needs two copies of the affected gene (one from each parent) to have the disease.

        "explanation": "\n\nOption (d) is correct because Helper T cells (Th) are crucial in assisting the activation of B cells and cytotoxic T cells, initiating and coordinating the adaptive immune response.  Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing excessive immune responses and preventing autoimmunity.  These are their primary functions.  The other options are incorrect. B lymphocytes primarily produce antibodies, not directly kill infected cells. That is the function of cytotoxic T cells. Natural Killer cells, indeed, are part of the innate immune system and kill infected or cancerous cells without prior sensitization; they do not mediate cellular immunity in the same way as T cells. Therefore, only the pairing of Helper T cells with their assisting role and Regulatory T cells with their regulatory function are accurately matched.  The question tests factual recall of the basic functions of different immune cells, a crucial concept in immunology and frequently relevant in UPSC examinations relating to diseases and their treatments.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nOption (c) is correct. Passive immunity is indeed acquired through the transfer of antibodies or activated T cells from an immune host, such as from mother to fetus. Active immunity is characterized by a long-lasting, specific response developed after exposure to an antigen, whether through infection or vaccination. The other options are incorrect because innate immunity is the body's first line of defense, not adaptive immunity.  Adaptive immunity develops after exposure to antigens, not innate immunity. Natural immunity is acquired through natural processes like infection, not vaccination which is a form of artificial immunity.

Cellular immunity is primarily mediated by T cells, not antibodies. Immunological memory is the ability of the immune system to mount a faster and stronger response upon secondary exposure to a pathogen, which is true but not the primary definition.

There is currently no licensed vaccine for Hepatitis C, making this statement true.  The other options are incorrect. mRNA vaccines do not use weakened or killed pathogens; they use mRNA to instruct cells to produce viral proteins.  Conventional vaccines typically use weakened or killed pathogens or their components.  While some vaccines provide long-lasting immunity, it is not necessarily lifelong for all vaccines, including the Hepatitis A vaccine. This question tests the knowledge of different vaccine types and their mechanisms, a very important topic for the UPSC given the increasing relevance of vaccines in public health.

Malaria is caused by Plasmodium protozoa.  The pairing of Hepatitis C with a fungus is incorrect; Hepatitis C is caused by a virus (Hepatitis C virus).  This question tests factual recall of the causative agents of several important diseases, a frequently examined area in the UPSC syllabus.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun breaks down oxygen molecules (O2) into oxygen atoms (O). These highly reactive oxygen atoms then combine with other oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3).\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Chlorine atoms, primarily from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), act as catalysts in the decomposition of ozone. A single chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules before being removed from the stratosphere.  This catalytic cycle is the main mechanism behind ozone depletion.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Ground-level ozone is a harmful pollutant, a key component of photochemical smog. It is a respiratory irritant and can damage plant tissues.  It is not beneficial to human health or plant growth.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.\n"

Prior to the understanding of their detrimental impact on the ozone layer, CFCs were widely employed as refrigerants due to their desirable properties like stability, non-toxicity, and low cost. Their use was prevalent in domestic refrigerators and various other applications.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Montreal Protocol, an international treaty, was designed and implemented to address the issue of ozone depletion caused by CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances.  The protocol established a phased-out schedule for the production and consumption of these substances, leading to a significant reduction in their atmospheric concentration.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Montreal Protocol has led to a substantial reduction in CFC emissions, their complete eradication from all applications is not yet fully realized.  Although many countries have successfully phased out CFCs in most applications, some limited uses may still exist in certain sectors, and complete global elimination remains a long-term goal.  The transition to CFC substitutes is ongoing and requires continuous monitoring and enforcement.\n"

It's a complex series of light-dependent and light-independent reactions involving various intermediate compounds and enzymes. The oxygen released is a byproduct of the splitting of water molecules, not a direct result of CO2 conversion.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Water (H\u2082O) is a crucial reactant in photosynthesis.  The water molecule is split (photolysis) during the light-dependent reactions, providing electrons and protons (H\u207a ions) that are essential for the reduction of CO2 to form carbohydrates.  The oxygen atom released is a byproduct of this process.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Traditional vaccines often utilize weakened or inactivated pathogens (viruses or bacteria) to stimulate an immune response. mRNA vaccines, however, work by delivering messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding a viral protein. The recipient's cells then produce this protein, triggering an immune response without the need to cultivate the actual pathogen.  This significantly reduces the development time and complexity of vaccine production.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  mRNA is inherently less stable than other vaccine components, making it susceptible to degradation.  This necessitates the use of very cold storage temperatures (typically ultra-low freezers) to maintain vaccine efficacy.  Traditional vaccines, depending on their formulation, may have greater stability and less stringent storage requirements.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  While some mRNA vaccines might be injected directly, many require a delivery system to enhance their uptake and efficacy.  Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are commonly used to encapsulate the mRNA, protecting it from degradation and facilitating its entry into cells. Electroporation, a technique that uses electrical pulses to create temporary pores in cell membranes, can also be employed to deliver mRNA more effectively.  Therefore, direct injection without any delivery system is not the norm for all mRNA vaccines.\n"

However, the statement claims it does *not* directly cause significant lung damage, which is an oversimplification.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Pulmonary tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection that specifically targets the lungs.  The bacteria, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, invade lung tissue, causing granulomas (nodules of immune cells) and potentially leading to cavity formation, significant tissue damage, and respiratory compromise. This is a primary characteristic of the disease.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.\n"

These acids are formed when sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react with water, oxygen, and oxidants in the atmosphere.  The combustion of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicle emissions are major sources of these precursor gases.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While ammonium ions (NH\u2084\u207a) can be present in acid rain, they are a product of atmospheric ammonia (NH\u2083) reacting with acidic components. They do not directly contribute to the corrosive nature of acid rain; rather, they can act as a buffer, slightly mitigating the acidity in some cases.  The primary corrosive agents are the hydrogen ions (H\u207a) from sulfuric and nitric acids.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Acid rain's effects are far-reaching.  It damages not only aquatic ecosystems (through acidification of lakes and streams, harming aquatic life) but also terrestrial ecosystems (by leaching essential nutrients from soils, affecting plant growth and overall biodiversity). Furthermore, acid rain poses significant threats to human health through respiratory problems and increased exposure to heavy metals mobilized from the soil.\n"

This makes reducing methane emissions a crucial aspect of climate change mitigation efforts.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Landfills are major sources of anthropogenic methane emissions.  In the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions), microorganisms decompose organic waste in landfills, producing methane as a byproduct.  Capturing and utilizing this landfill gas can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Agricultural activities are significant contributors to global methane emissions.  Rice paddies, due to their waterlogged conditions, create anaerobic environments conducive to methane production by methanogenic archaea.

This can lead to widespread health problems and necessitates careful management of Uranium mining and processing activities.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Both Rajasthan and Telangana are known for their Uranium deposits.  Mining and processing activities in these regions can lead to environmental contamination through the release of radioactive materials and heavy metals into the surrounding environment, including water bodies and soil.  The Northwestern states of India also have considerable Uranium deposits.\n"

Its higher abundance makes it a potentially more sustainable nuclear fuel source. The development of Thorium-based reactors is driven by this abundance and the potential to reduce reliance on Uranium.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Thorium reactors are designed to utilize Thorium as fuel.  Through neutron bombardment, Thorium-232 is converted into Uranium-233, a fissile isotope that sustains the chain reaction.  The AHWR is an example of a reactor design intended for this purpose.  Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are another example of a technology that utilizes Thorium.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. India has substantial Thorium reserves, making it a key player in Thorium-based nuclear energy research and development. The geographic distribution of these reserves is extensive, encompassing several states beyond just Kerala.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is partially correct but overstates the impact. While Bt cotton reduced the need for some broad-spectrum insecticides, the overall pesticide usage hasn't uniformly decreased across all cotton farming practices.  The reduction is context-dependent and not universal.\n\nStatement 2 is largely correct. The adoption of Bt cotton did lead to an increase in cotton production in India, although the extent of the increase is subject to various factors including weather patterns and farming practices.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Bt cotton provided resistance to specific pests, but it did not eliminate pest infestations entirely.  Other pests and evolving resistance mechanisms still pose challenges to cotton cultivation.  The claim is an oversimplification of a complex agricultural reality."

While viral vectors (like adeno-associated viruses or lentiviruses) are commonly used due to their efficiency in delivering genes into cells, non-viral methods such as liposomes or physical methods are also under development and investigation.  The choice of vector depends on the target cells and the nature of the therapeutic gene.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While CRISPR-Cas9 is predominantly used in somatic cell gene therapy (modifying genes in non-reproductive cells), its potential application in germline therapy (modifying genes in reproductive cells) is a subject of intense ethical and scientific debate.  The statement\u2019s absolute claim is therefore false.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Gene therapy offers a promising approach for treating hemophilia A by introducing a functional copy of the gene responsible for producing clotting factor VIII (FVIII), thus correcting the genetic defect.  Numerous clinical trials have explored this strategy.\n"

This evolutionary advantage has led to a higher frequency of the sickle cell trait in malaria-prone regions.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Plague significantly impacted Muhammad Tughlaq's army, contributing to its weakening and ultimately affecting the stability of his reign.  The army's large size, close quarters, and potentially poor hygiene created conditions conducive to the rapid spread of the disease.  The vulnerability of the population to disease was a factor in the impact.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.

The approval was met with significant controversy, and its widespread adoption is still uncertain. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While herbicide-tolerant crops aim to reduce pesticide use, the evidence of significant reduction in India related to GM crops is not conclusive and has been debated extensively. This makes option (b) the only fully correct choice.  The other options include at least one false statement."

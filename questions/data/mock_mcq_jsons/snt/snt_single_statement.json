        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (b) because B cells differentiate into two main effector cell types: plasma cells and memory B cells.  Plasma cells are short-lived antibody factories, responsible for the immediate humoral immune response.  Their primary function is the mass production and secretion of antibodies specific to the encountered antigen.  Memory B cells, on the other hand, are long-lived cells that remain in the body even after the infection is cleared. They provide immunological memory, allowing for a faster and more robust response upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen. This is the basis of long-term immunity.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly attribute functions to cell types. Cytotoxic T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, not humoral immunity. Helper T cells help activate B cells but don't produce antibodies themselves. Regulatory T cells modulate the immune response, not produce antibodies.  Understanding the distinct roles of these cell types within the adaptive immune system is crucial for comprehending the complexities of immune responses.\n"

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (c) because the Ionosphere's ability to facilitate radio communication hinges on its ionization.  The high concentration of charged particles (ions and electrons) in this layer of the atmosphere causes radio waves to refract (bend) and reflect, bouncing them back towards the Earth's surface. This allows for long-distance radio communication, even across vast distances. Option (a) is partially correct as temperature plays a role in ionization, but the primary mechanism is the presence of charged particles. Option (b) is incorrect; while the magnetosphere is related, the Ionosphere's reflective properties are independent of this shielding effect. Option (d) is incorrect; the distance from the Earth's surface is not the primary factor determining its role in radio communication.  The height and density of the ionized layers are key.\n"

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (b) because the primary function of U-235 in a nuclear reactor is to undergo nuclear fission when bombarded with neutrons. This fission process releases a tremendous amount of energy, which is harnessed to generate electricity.  Option (a) is incorrect because neutron irradiation doesn't directly accelerate the inherent radioactive decay rate of U-235; the decay is a separate, slower process. Option (c) is incorrect because fission doesn't typically lead to a more stable isotope; it results in the production of fission products, many of which are radioactive. Option (d) is incorrect because U-235 participates in fission (splitting of a nucleus), not fusion (combining of nuclei).  Understanding the difference between fission and fusion is crucial for comprehending nuclear reactor operation.  The high concentration of U-235 in HEU ensures a sustained chain reaction.\n"

        "explanation": " Acid rain, characterized by the presence of sulphate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b), is primarily caused by the atmospheric conversion of sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) into sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084).  Sulfur dioxide, released from industrial activities (burning fossil fuels) and natural sources (volcanoes), reacts with water and oxygen in the atmosphere, forming sulfuric acid. This acid then falls to the earth as precipitation, contributing to the lowering of pH in water bodies and soil. Option (a) is incorrect because while mineral dissolution contributes to the acidity of water, it's not the primary source of sulphate ions in acid rain. Option (b) is partially correct as SO\u2082 is a precursor, but it's the *oxidation* of SO\u2082 to form H\u2082SO\u2084 that is the key step. Option (d) refers to a different type of sulphur cycle process.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe fundamental difference between graphite and diamond lies in their atomic arrangement. Graphite's structure consists of layers of carbon atoms bonded in a hexagonal lattice, allowing for easy slippage between layers, which accounts for its softness and lubricating properties.  Diamond, in contrast, has a strong three-dimensional tetrahedral network of carbon-carbon bonds, resulting in its exceptional hardness.  Option (b) is incorrect because graphite is a good conductor of electricity due to its delocalized electrons, while diamond is an insulator. Option (c) is false; while both form under high pressure, diamond formation generally requires significantly higher pressures than graphite formation. Option (d) is incorrect because while both are relatively inert, diamond is even more resistant to chemical attack than graphite.

Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gaseous state (water vapor). This transformation is driven by solar insolation, which provides the energy needed to overcome the intermolecular forces holding water molecules together.  Atmospheric pressure influences evaporation rates; lower pressure facilitates evaporation.  Salinity inversely affects evaporation; higher salinity lowers the rate.  Evaporation is a primary source of water vapor in the atmosphere, directly affecting relative humidity (the amount of water vapor present relative to the maximum amount it can hold at a given temperature) and leading to the saturation point (the point at which the air can no longer hold more water vapor). The capillary action mentioned refers to the movement of water upwards through porous materials, carrying dissolved salts along with it \u2013 a process particularly relevant in coastal regions where evaporation from the soil contributes to salinity.

Water molecules are highly polar, leading to strong intermolecular forces and a high surface tension. Oil molecules, being nonpolar, have weaker intermolecular forces and lower surface tension. This difference in surface tension prevents them from mixing readily. Bulk modulus, shear strain, and volume effects are not the primary reasons for this phenomenon.

Sunlight undergoes refraction (bending) as it enters a water droplet, then reflection (bouncing) off the inner surface of the droplet, and finally, refraction again as it exits the droplet. This process leads to the separation of white light into its constituent colors, creating a rainbow. The secondary rainbow, fainter and located above the primary rainbow, results from a double reflection within the water droplets, creating a reversed color sequence.  Diffraction, interference, polarization, and scattering are also optical phenomena, but they do not primarily explain the formation of a secondary rainbow.  Therefore, only refraction and reflection accurately describe the physical processes involved.\n"

As new oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, it records the direction and intensity of the Earth's magnetic field at the time of formation. Because the Earth's magnetic field has reversed polarity many times throughout its history, the resulting rock formations exhibit alternating bands of normal and reversed polarity. Volcanic activity, tectonic plate movement, and ocean currents contribute to the formation of the ocean floor, but they do not directly create the magnetic striping pattern. The magnetic field's influence on the magnetization of the newly formed rocks is the key to understanding this phenomenon.\n"

CMEs, in particular, can send billions of tons of plasma hurtling towards Earth. When this plasma interacts with Earth's magnetosphere, it induces powerful geomagnetic storms. These storms can severely disrupt power grids by inducing currents in long conductors, leading to transformers overheating and failing. Auroras are a visual effect of this interaction, but the primary cause of the disruption is the CME itself. Solar winds are a constant stream of particles, but CMEs represent a much more intense and disruptive event. Geomagnetic reversals are geological phenomena occurring over millennia, not responsible for short-term disruptions.\n"

Females, with two X chromosomes (XX), typically need two copies of the mutated gene to exhibit the full-blown disorder; they can be carriers if they possess one mutated and one normal X chromosome. This explains the disproportionately higher incidence of haemophilia in males. Autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns involve genes on non-sex chromosomes and affect both sexes equally.

This triggers an immune response, leading to the production of antibodies and T cells that can provide immunity against future infection. Option (a) is incorrect because mRNA vaccines do not interact with the recipient's DNA. Option (b) is a description of traditional attenuated or inactivated vaccines.

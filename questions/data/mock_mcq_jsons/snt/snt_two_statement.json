While plasma cells are a major product of B cell differentiation and are the primary antibody-producing cells, B cells can also differentiate into memory B cells.  Memory B cells are essential for long-term immunity, providing a faster and more robust response upon subsequent encounters with the same antigen.  Therefore, B cell differentiation is not exclusively limited to plasma cell formation.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Memory B cells are a crucial component of the adaptive immune system.  These cells persist in the body long after an initial infection or vaccination, providing immunological memory. Upon re-exposure to the same antigen, memory B cells rapidly proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells, leading to a quicker and more effective antibody response.  This is the basis of long-lasting immunity.\n"

Latitude directly impacts the angle at which solar radiation strikes the Earth's surface.  At the equator, the sun's rays are almost directly overhead, resulting in more concentrated solar energy and higher temperatures.

These variations in surface reflectivity represent the digital data encoding the audio information. The laser's reflected light is then converted into electrical signals which are processed and amplified to produce sound.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While reflection and transmission play a role, the primary cause of the rainbow effect on CDs viewed in sunlight is diffraction.  The closely spaced tracks on the CD act as a diffraction grating, causing light to diffract and interfere, resulting in the observed colorful patterns.  Refraction also contributes to a lesser extent.\n"

The statement incorrectly conflates and misorders these processes, suggesting a chemical bath is used *during* photolithography. Insulator deposition also occurs in multiple steps throughout the process, not solely after etching in the described manner.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Assembly, testing, marking, and packaging are integral final stages. Assembly connects the silicon die to the PCB. Testing verifies functionality. Marking identifies the chip, and packaging protects it and manages heat dissipation. These steps are essential for ensuring that the final product is functional, reliable, and ready for use.\n"

While the exact figure fluctuates, the current atmospheric concentration of CO2 consistently surpasses 400 ppm, making statement 1 factually accurate.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Anaerobic digestion, a biological process where organic matter is broken down in the absence of oxygen, produces CO2 as a byproduct. This process is commonly employed in biogas production.  Furthermore, the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) releases substantial amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Therefore, statement 2 accurately reflects the sources of CO2.\n"

Nitrogen, a crucial element for plant growth, is primarily obtained by plants through the process of nitrogen fixation carried out by specialized bacteria in the soil.  These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a usable form for plants.\n2.  Atmospheric nitrogen, though abundant, is not directly usable by most plants.

This is a crucial step in making nitrogen available to the wider ecosystem.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  While atmospheric nitrogen is plentiful (approximately 78% of the atmosphere), plants lack the enzymes necessary to directly utilize it. They require nitrogen in more reactive forms like nitrates (NO3-) and nitrites (NO2-), which are produced through a series of biological transformations within the nitrogen cycle.  These transformations involve several types of bacteria including nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) gene, located on the Y chromosome, plays a crucial role in initiating the male developmental pathway.  This gene encodes a protein called the testis-determining factor (TDF), which triggers the differentiation of the undifferentiated gonads into testes.  The testes then produce testosterone and other hormones that lead to the development of male secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Individuals with an XXY karyotype have Klinefelter syndrome. While they possess two X chromosomes, the presence of a Y chromosome, and thus the SRY gene, leads to the development of male characteristics, albeit often with associated developmental delays and other health issues. The presence of the extra X chromosome does modify the typical male phenotype, resulting in characteristics like reduced fertility and sometimes less pronounced secondary sexual characteristics, but they are still phenotypically male.  The presence of the Y chromosome overrides the effect of the extra X chromosome in this context.\n"

The extent of this impact depends on the magnitude and location of the eruption, as well as atmospheric circulation patterns. The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption is a prime example of a volcanic event significantly affecting stratospheric ozone and global temperatures.\n"

The semi-conservative nature of replication ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.  Each parental DNA strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. This mechanism minimizes errors and maintains the integrity of the genetic code.  The Meselson-Stahl experiment provided definitive evidence for the semi-conservative model of DNA replication.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The statement describes the process of *translation*, not transcription. Transcription is the process of synthesizing an RNA molecule (specifically messenger RNA or mRNA) using a DNA template.  Translation, on the other hand, is the process where the genetic information encoded in mRNA is used to synthesize a polypeptide chain (protein) at the ribosome.  Therefore, the synthesis of a protein directly from a DNA template is incorrect; an intermediary RNA molecule is always involved.\n"

Total internal reflection (TIR) is an optical phenomenon that occurs when light travels from a denser medium (higher refractive index) to a rarer medium (lower refractive index) and the angle of incidence exceeds a certain critical angle.  At angles greater than the critical angle, all the incident light is reflected back into the denser medium, resulting in no transmission into the rarer medium. This principle is used in various optical devices, such as optical fibers and prisms.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Ideally, in total internal reflection, there is *no* loss of light intensity.  However, in real-world scenarios, there might be minor losses due to imperfections in the interface between the two media or absorption within the denser medium.  But these losses are usually negligible compared to the reflection efficiency. The high efficiency of TIR is what makes it so useful in optical technologies.  The absence of significant intensity loss is a key characteristic differentiating TIR from other types of reflection.\n"

A homogeneous and transparent medium ensures that the light's path is not altered due to variations in the medium's properties.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index.  This bending demonstrates that light does not always travel in a perfectly straight line; its path is altered at the interface between different media. The degree of bending depends on the refractive indices of the two media and the angle of incidence.

Organic waste in landfills decomposes anaerobically (without oxygen), producing methane as a byproduct. This is a widely known environmental issue.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), meaning it traps significantly more heat in the atmosphere per unit of mass. While CO\u2082 remains in the atmosphere longer, methane's higher radiative efficiency makes it a more immediate concern for climate change.

This steep gradient causes a stronger force pushing air from high to low pressure, resulting in stronger winds. This is a fundamental principle in meteorology.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While pressure gradients are a crucial factor influencing geostrophic winds (winds that result from a balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force), they do not solely determine the direction. The Coriolis force, caused by the Earth's rotation, significantly deflects the wind direction, especially at higher altitudes where friction is less significant.  Geostrophic winds flow parallel to isobars, not directly from high to low pressure as the pressure gradient force alone would dictate.  Friction near the Earth's surface further complicates the wind direction, making it deviate from the purely geostrophic pattern.\n"

The proportion of impact-generated materials significantly outweighs the contribution from purely volcanic processes.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The permanently shadowed craters at the lunar south pole are of significant interest because they are believed to contain substantial deposits of water ice.  These regions are shielded from direct sunlight, allowing water ice to persist for extended periods, making them potential sources of water for future lunar bases and missions.  The presence of water ice is a major factor driving interest in exploring this region of the Moon.\n"

The hydrophobic tails interact with grease and oil, while the hydrophilic heads interact with water.  This allows soaps to emulsify grease and oil, breaking them down into tiny droplets that are suspended in water and can be easily rinsed away.  Emulsification is the primary mechanism by which soaps achieve their cleansing action.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While adsorption may play a minor role in the removal of some types of dirt, it is not the primary mechanism by which soaps remove grease and oil. The main action is emulsification, where the soap molecules surround the grease and oil droplets, creating an emulsion that is easily removed with water. Adsorption, the adherence of molecules to a surface, is not the dominant process in the cleansing action of soaps.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The Wolbachia method doesn't involve genetic modification in the sense of introducing a foreign gene for disease resistance.  Instead, it leverages the naturally occurring bacterium *Wolbachia pipientis*, which infects some mosquito populations.  Introducing *Wolbachia* into *Aedes* mosquitoes (vectors for dengue, Zika, and chikungunya) doesn't directly confer disease resistance to the mosquitoes themselves.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The core mechanism of the Wolbachia method lies in cytoplasmic incompatibility.  When *Wolbachia*-infected male mosquitoes mate with uninfected females, the resulting eggs are often not viable.  This reduces the overall reproductive success of the mosquito population, leading to a decrease in the vector population over time, thus controlling the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.  While other mechanisms may contribute, cytoplasmic incompatibility is the primary driver of the Wolbachia method's effectiveness.\n"

These organic materials, if left to accumulate, would lead to a rapid decline in water quality, causing harmful algal blooms and creating a toxic environment for the fish.  Efficient biofiltration is crucial for maintaining healthy conditions.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Ammonia, a toxic byproduct of fish metabolism, is a major concern in aquaculture.  Biofilters house beneficial bacteria (nitrifying bacteria) that convert ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2-) and then to nitrate (NO3-).  Nitrate is far less toxic than ammonia, making this conversion a key process in maintaining water quality and preventing fish mortality.

Long reads provide sufficient overlap to accurately resolve these complexities.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Short-read sequencing, while limited in its ability to resolve complex repetitive regions, is highly efficient for applications focused on quantifying the abundance of specific DNA sequences.

Solar flares are caused by the release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's *atmosphere*, specifically in the corona and chromosphere, not the core.  The Sun's core is where nuclear fusion takes place, generating the Sun's energy.  The complex magnetic fields in the Sun's outer layers are responsible for the sudden and intense energy releases that characterize solar flares.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the multifaceted impact of space weather or the origin of solar flares.\n\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While heavy water can contribute to cooling, its primary function in a nuclear reactor is as a *moderator*.  It slows down the speed of neutrons, not primarily as a coolant. Coolants are used to manage the heat generated by the nuclear fission process, and various substances can serve this purpose. Heavy water's role in moderating neutron speed is crucial for controlling the chain reaction.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Heavy water's main purpose is to *slow down* the speed of neutrons, not speed them up.  Fast neutrons are less likely to cause fission in uranium-235, the most commonly used fissile material in nuclear reactors.  Slowing them down (thermalizing them) significantly increases the probability of fission, making the chain reaction more efficient and controllable. Therefore, both statements misrepresent the key function of heavy water in nuclear reactors.\n"

The higher average density strongly suggests the presence of a dense core, primarily composed of iron and nickel, which contributes significantly to the overall mass of the planet.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Earth's rotation causes a centrifugal force that is strongest at the equator.  This force acts outward, causing a slight bulge at the equator and a corresponding flattening at the poles.

Individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, are considerably more susceptible to severe TB infections. Their weakened immune responses make them less able to combat the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, leading to a higher risk of developing severe disease progression and complications.  This highlights the importance of co-infection management and integrated public health interventions.  The synergy between HIV/AIDS and TB underscores the need for holistic healthcare approaches.\n"

MRI is a powerful non-invasive technique used to create detailed images of internal body structures, particularly soft tissues like the brain, muscles, ligaments, and organs. The high resolution and contrast provided by MRI makes it an essential tool in diagnosing a wide range of medical conditions.  Its non-invasive nature makes it a preferred method for imaging sensitive areas and avoiding the risks associated with other techniques.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While MRI does involve the interaction of radio waves with the body's atoms, it's not based on electron spin resonance.  MRI utilizes the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which involves the interaction of radio waves with the magnetic moments of atomic nuclei (primarily hydrogen protons) within the body's tissues.  The difference between NMR and ESR lies in the target of the interaction: nuclei in NMR versus electrons in ESR.  This distinction is fundamental to the underlying physics of the two techniques."

This flood of requests renders the target system unusable for legitimate users, disrupting services and causing significant damage. Understanding the mechanism behind DDoS attacks\u2014the coordinated effort of multiple systems\u2014is crucial for developing effective defenses.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Several strategies are employed to mitigate DDoS attacks.  Robust firewalls act as the first line of defense by filtering malicious traffic. CDNs distribute traffic across multiple servers, reducing the burden on any single server and making it more difficult for attackers to overwhelm the system. Rate-limiting techniques control the number of requests accepted from a single source or IP address, preventing attackers from flooding the system with excessive requests.  These measures, in combination with other advanced techniques, are essential for protecting systems from DDoS attacks.\n"

The statement incorrectly claims its current approval status and oversimplifies its design, which includes elements for both pest resistance and herbicide tolerance.  The ongoing debate surrounding its approval and potential environmental impacts makes the statement factually inaccurate concerning its current status in India."

Lake Van's salinity is indeed over 300 ppt. The Baltic Sea's low salinity is well-documented due to significant freshwater input from rivers. The Mediterranean Sea experiences high evaporation rates, resulting in elevated salinity. The Great Salt Lake, while having high salinity, is not as saline as the Dead Sea.

This is a well-known relationship within the Krishna River basin.\n\n3. **Brahmaputra River and Barak River:** The Barak River is a major tributary of the Brahmaputra River system, joining it in Bangladesh.  Understanding the transboundary nature of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries is crucial.\n\n4. **Godavari River and Indravati River:** The Indravati River is a tributary of the Godavari River, joining it in Odisha. This is a less frequently discussed but important tributary within the Godavari basin.\n\nAll the pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of India's major river systems and their interconnectedness.

        "explanation": "\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the distinctive features of peninsular rivers.\n\n1. **Narmada River and Rift Valley:** The Narmada River flows through the Narmada rift valley, a significant geological feature of the Indian peninsula.  This is a key characteristic of the river's course.\n\n2. **Tapti River and Origin:** While the Tapti River is closely associated with the Satpura Range, its origin is actually in the Satpura Range's eastern slopes, not within the range itself. This makes the statement slightly inaccurate.\n\n3. **Krishna River and Arcuate Delta:** The Krishna River forms a prominent arcuate delta where it meets the Bay of Bengal. This is a well-known characteristic of its drainage pattern.\n\n4. **Pennar River and Eastern Ghats:** The Pennar River flows through the Eastern Ghats, cutting through parts of the range. This is a correct observation of the river's course.\n\nTherefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The inclusion of a partially correct pair (Tapti River) serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the river's origin.  The question emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific geographical features associated with each river.\n"

This is a fundamental concept in geomorphology.\n\n2. **Ganga River and Doon Valley:** While the Ganga River system is vast, it doesn't directly flow *through* the Doon Valley.  The Yamuna, a tributary of the Ganga, flows through the Doon Valley. This is a subtle but important distinction.\n\n3. **Brahmaputra River and Meandering Course:** In its plains section in Assam, the Brahmaputra River exhibits significant meandering, forming loops and oxbow lakes.  This is a readily observable characteristic.\n\n4. **Sutlej River and Origin:** The Sutlej River originates from the Manasarovar-Rakas Lakes in Tibet, not the Kailash Range, although it's geographically proximate. This is a factual error.\n\nTherefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, testing the depth of the candidate's knowledge and their ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.

        "explanation": "\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of the key characteristics of the Indian monsoon system and their underlying causes. The sudden onset is indeed linked to the rapid northward movement of the ITCZ, a zone of low pressure where trade winds converge.  The gradual retreat is associated with the southward shift of the ITCZ and the weakening of the subtropical high-pressure belt, allowing the reversal of wind patterns.  The seasonal reversal of winds is fundamentally driven by the differential heating of land and seamasses, which creates pressure gradients that dictate the wind direction.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. This question requires an understanding of the dynamics of atmospheric pressure systems and their influence on monsoon behavior.  Knowing these mechanisms is essential for understanding monsoon variability and its impact on India's climate.\n"

La Ni\u00f1a events, conversely, result in cooler than average sea surface temperatures in the same region. This usually favors increased monsoon rainfall and cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal.  Western Disturbances are extratropical cyclones originating in the Mediterranean region that bring winter rainfall to the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent, including the Sutlej-Ganga Plain.

Mars's thin atmosphere is a direct consequence of the absence of a global magnetic field, allowing the solar wind to erode its atmosphere over time. Jupiter's strong magnetic field is linked to its thick atmosphere,  influencing the dynamics of both. The other options are incorrect as they omit one or more of these correct pairings.\n"

Therefore, this pairing is incorrect.\n\n2. **Highest Iron Ore Production : Odisha:** Odisha consistently ranks as the highest producer of iron ore in India due to its vast reserves in the eastern part of the state. This pairing is correct.\n\n3. **Major Bauxite Deposits : Odisha:** Odisha is indeed a major producer of bauxite, the primary ore of aluminum.  Its deposits in the Koraput and Kalahandi districts are well-known.

While other industries exist, these two sectors were, and to some extent remain, dominant. This pairing is correct.\n\n2. **Mumbai-Pune Industrial Region : Dominated by heavy engineering industries:**  The Mumbai-Pune region has a diverse industrial base. While heavy industries are present, describing the region as *dominated* by heavy engineering is inaccurate. The region boasts a significant presence in textiles, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other sectors. This pairing is incorrect.\n\n3. **Gujarat Industrial Region : Significant concentration of petrochemical industries:** The Gujarat industrial region, particularly around Ankleshwar and Jamnagar, experienced significant growth in petrochemical industries, fueled by oil discoveries. This pairing is correct.\n\n4. **Bangalore-Chennai Industrial Region : Relies heavily on coal for energy:** The Bangalore-Chennai industrial region's development was significantly influenced by hydroelectric power, not coal.

This deflection leads to the characteristic anticlockwise rotation of cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n3. **Heavy Rainfall and Moist Air Convergence:** The low-pressure center of a cyclone draws in vast quantities of warm, moist air from the surrounding areas. This converging air rises, cools, and condenses, leading to torrential rainfall.\n\n4. **Storm Surge and Elevated Sea Levels:** The strong winds associated with cyclones push water towards the coast, causing a significant rise in sea level known as a storm surge. This surge can cause devastating coastal flooding.\n\n5. **Wind Speeds and Low-Pressure Center:** The intense pressure gradient between the eye's low pressure and the surrounding higher pressure is what generates the extremely high wind speeds observed in cyclones.\n"

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (b) because only pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the differences between tropical and temperate cyclones.  Let's analyze each pair:\n\n* **Pair 1 (Wind Velocity):** Tropical cyclones are indeed characterized by significantly higher wind speeds (100-250 kmph) compared to temperate cyclones (30-150 kmph). This difference stems from the energy source \u2013 latent heat of condensation in tropical cyclones versus temperature and density differences in temperate cyclones.\n\n* **Pair 2 (Lifetime):** The statement is incorrect. Tropical cyclones typically have a shorter lifespan (less than a week) than temperate cyclones (2-3 weeks). Temperate cyclones are associated with larger-scale atmospheric systems and can persist for longer durations.\n\n* **Pair 3 (Isobars):**  The isobars (lines of equal pressure) in tropical cyclones form nearly concentric circles around the low-pressure center, indicating a steep pressure gradient. In contrast, the isobars in temperate cyclones are more elongated and V-shaped, reflecting a less intense pressure gradient.\n\n* **Pair 4 (Path):**  The general path of tropical cyclones is initially east-west, influenced by trade winds, before curving poleward. Temperate cyclones, however, generally move west-east due to the prevailing westerlies.  However, the movement of cyclones is complex and influenced by various factors, making this a less reliable differentiator.\n\n* **Pair 5 (Temperature Distribution):** The temperature distribution within a tropical cyclone's eye is relatively uniform, while in temperate cyclones, temperatures vary significantly across different sectors due to the interaction of contrasting air masses.\n"

Temperate cyclones, on the other hand, are driven by temperature, humidity, and density differences between contrasting air masses.\n\n* **Pair 3 (Influence of Jet Streams):** The interaction between tropical cyclones and upper-level airflows (jet streams) is less well-defined compared to temperate cyclones, which exhibit a clear relationship with jet streams, Rossby waves, and other upper-level atmospheric features.\n\n* **Pair 4 (Clouds):** Tropical cyclones typically display a more limited range of cloud types (cumulonimbus, nimbostratus, etc.), while temperate cyclones exhibit a greater diversity of cloud formations at various altitudes.\n\n* **Pair 5 (Surface Anticyclones):**  Tropical cyclones are not typically associated with surface anticyclones, whereas temperate cyclones often have anticyclones preceding and succeeding them in their life cycle.

Heavy rainfall leads to increased soil erosion, particularly in vulnerable coastal areas. Storm surges, a significant aspect of cyclones, result in widespread coastal flooding and inundation of low-lying regions. Low atmospheric pressure, while not a direct cause of damage, contributes to the overall intensity of the cyclone and exacerbates the effects of wind, rain, and storm surges, leading to reduced agricultural yields through crop damage and saltwater intrusion.

The Tibetan Plateau experiences high pressure due to its high altitude and the associated adiabatic cooling of the air (pair 2 is correct). Subtropical high-pressure belts are caused by the descending air from the Hadley cells in the general atmospheric circulation (pair 3 is correct). The eye of a tropical cyclone is a region of relatively low pressure, not high pressure, and is formed by the rising air (pair 4 is incorrect). The eyewall of a tropical cyclone is a region of intense rising air, not descending air (pair 5 is incorrect). Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched."

This allows them to propagate across vast distances in deep ocean waters with minimal energy loss.  When these long waves approach shallower waters near continental shelves, the shoaling effect causes a dramatic increase in wave height and amplitude. This is because the wave's speed decreases as the water depth reduces, leading to a concentration of energy and a significant increase in wave height. Deep ocean trenches are associated with the generation of tsunamis, but not directly with high wave amplitude initially. Coastal plains are vulnerable to tsunami impact due to their proximity to the ocean, but this is a consequence of the wave's behaviour, not a characteristic of the wave itself. Submerged volcanic eruptions are a significant cause of tsunamis.\n"

The Labrador Current does not directly interact with the coastal regions of Australia.\n\nThe East Greenland Current is a cold current that flows southward along the eastern coast of Greenland and hence is correctly paired with Southern Chile.  The Kuroshio Current is a warm current in the western North Pacific Ocean and is not associated with Cape Hatteras. Cape Hatteras is where the Gulf Stream begins to turn eastward.  New Zealand is located in the South Pacific, influenced by several currents but not directly the North Atlantic Drift. Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.\n"

The statement misrepresents the precise geographical relationship between these features.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Carlsberg Ridge is a major mid-ocean ridge system situated in the northern part of the Indian Ocean. It forms a crucial part of the global mid-ocean ridge system, known for its role in seafloor spreading and tectonic plate movement.  Its location within the Indian Ocean basin is well-established in geographical literature.\n\nTherefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the geographical realities concerning the Indian Ocean's features.

The park's ecosystem is predominantly characterized by Shola forests and grasslands, a unique high-altitude vegetation type found in the Western Ghats. This fact requires specific knowledge of the geographical location and ecological characteristics of the Anamudi peak and its surrounding national park.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Western Ghats' topography is a key factor influencing its river systems.  The steep gradient causes rivers to flow rapidly towards the Arabian Sea. This rapid flow, combined with the relatively short distance from the source to the sea, prevents the significant sediment deposition necessary for delta formation.  Furthermore, the strong wave action along the Arabian Sea coast erodes and disperses any deposited sediment, further hindering delta development.  The thick vegetation and less easily erodible soil of the Western Ghats also contribute to the limited sediment load carried by the rivers.  This explanation demonstrates an understanding of the interplay between geological factors, hydrological processes, and coastal dynamics in shaping the landscape of the Western Ghats.

The abundant rainfall supports the growth of lush evergreen and moist deciduous forests, characteristic of the region's biodiversity. This demonstrates knowledge of monsoon mechanics and their impact on vegetation.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The rain shadow effect is a key climatic feature associated with the Western Ghats. As the monsoon winds lose their moisture on the windward side, they become drier as they descend on the leeward (eastern) side.  This results in significantly lower rainfall in the rain shadow regions of Maharashtra and Karnataka. The drier conditions lead to a different vegetation pattern, with drier forests and scrublands dominating the landscape. This shows understanding of the rain shadow effect and its geographical implications.  The contrast in climate and vegetation between the windward and leeward sides of the Western Ghats is a significant aspect of the region's geographical diversity.\n"

Statement 1 correctly notes the Himalayas' role as a climatic barrier.  The towering mountain range effectively blocks the cold, dry winds originating from the Arctic region, preventing them from reaching the Indian subcontinent. The Himalayas also significantly impact monsoon rainfall distribution.  The orographic effect causes heavy rainfall on the windward slopes, while the leeward side experiences a rain shadow effect. The eastward decrease in rainfall is largely due to the progressive depletion of moisture as the monsoon winds travel westward across the plains.\n\nStatement 2 also highlights a crucial aspect of the Himalayas' influence. By acting as a barrier, the Himalayas force the moisture-laden monsoon winds to rise and cool, resulting in heavy precipitation over the northern plains. This precipitation is a major contributor to the formation and fertility of the alluvial soil in the Ganga Plain.  The absence of the Himalayas would drastically alter the region's climate and lead to desertification of large portions of northern India.

The 'duns' or valleys are located between the Lesser Himalayas and the Shiwalik range.  The description incorrectly positions the Shiwalik's relation to the 'duns'. The innermost range is the Great Himalayas (Himadri).\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Purvanchal hills are indeed an eastward extension of the Himalayas, continuing southwards through Myanmar (Arakan Yoma) and even further.  The listed names (Patkai Bum, Naga Hills, Mizo Hills) accurately reflect the diverse local names used for these ranges.  This statement accurately reflects the geographical extension of the Purvanchal range.  The connection to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, while not a direct physical continuation, highlights the geological relationship often discussed in geographical contexts.\n\nOptions (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misinterpret the relative positions of the Shiwalik range and the 'duns' within the Himalayan system and fail to accurately reflect the geographical extent of the Purvanchal Hills.\n"

The five rivers (Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej) do eventually join the Indus, but the statement of their collective joining at Mithankot as the Panjnad river is only mostly accurate. It is the Panjnad, which is formed by the confluence of the five rivers, that joins the Indus near Mithankot. The slight imprecision in phrasing creates a plausible distractor for candidates who may not recall the exact confluence point.\n\n\nOptions (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the origin of the Indus River and the precise confluence point of its five eastern tributaries.\n"

It originates at Amarkantak, flows westwards through a rift valley, and indeed empties into the Arabian Sea via the Gulf of Khambhat. The location of the rift valley between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges is also a key geographical feature influencing its flow. This statement demonstrates factual recall and understanding of the river's geographical characteristics.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While a slight westward tilt of the central Indian plateau exists, it is not the primary determinant of the Narmada's westward flow. The dominant factor is the pre-existing rift valley, a geological formation that predates the current topography and dictates the river's course. Attributing the westward flow solely to the general slope oversimplifies the complex geological history and processes that shaped the river's path.  This highlights the need for analytical thinking in distinguishing between contributing factors and primary causes in geographical phenomena.\n"

The Narmada River, a major west-flowing river of peninsular India, originates from the Amarkantak hills in Madhya Pradesh and flows westward into the Arabian Sea. The Son River, also originating in the Amarkantak hills, flows in the opposite direction, northward, eventually joining the Ganga River. This contrasting flow pattern is determined by the geological formations and the slope of the land. The Narmada flows through a rift valley, which dictates its westward course.  The difference in the direction of the flow of these two rivers, originating from the same source, illustrates the influence of geographical factors on river systems.\n\nStatement 2 is partially incorrect. The Chambal River is indeed known for its severe gully erosion and is a tributary of the Yamuna River, which joins the Ganga.  However, the Kosi River is not a direct tributary of the Ganga. It flows through Nepal and Bihar before joining the Ganga. The statement inaccurately simplifies the Kosi's course and its relationship with the Ganga river system.  Both rivers, though, are known for their erosional power and the challenges they pose to the regions they flow through.\n"

Leh, situated at a high altitude in the Himalayas, experiences extremely cold winters, with temperatures plummeting to well below freezing.  In contrast, Thiruvananthapuram, located in southern India, enjoys a comparatively mild climate with much higher temperatures due to its proximity to the equator and the moderating influence of the sea.  The contrast illustrates the influence of both latitude and altitude on temperature.\n\nStatement 2 correctly points out the difference in diurnal temperature ranges between the Thar Desert and Kerala.  The Thar Desert, being a landlocked arid region, experiences extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night. The lack of moisture and the significant difference in solar radiation between day and night results in a large diurnal temperature range. Kerala, on the other hand, situated on the coast, benefits from the moderating influence of the sea, resulting in a smaller diurnal temperature range. The proximity of a large water body helps to regulate temperatures, reducing the extreme fluctuations between day and night.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately describes several key characteristics of temperate coniferous forests. The growing season in these forests is indeed relatively short, typically lasting between 50 and 100 days due to the cold temperatures and short summers. The dense canopy cover of coniferous trees limits light penetration to the forest floor, resulting in sparse undergrowth.  Annual precipitation varies considerably across different locations within the temperate coniferous forest biome, depending on factors such as proximity to the coast and mountain ranges.  This spatial variation in precipitation is a significant feature of the biome.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect in several aspects. While temperate coniferous forests do exhibit low variation in annual temperature (compared to other biomes), the humidity levels are not necessarily high due to dense canopy cover.  The dense canopy can trap moisture, but overall humidity can vary depending on other factors such as precipitation patterns. Moreover, the understory vegetation is typically sparse, not diverse, due to the limited sunlight reaching the forest floor. The undergrowth is often restricted to shade-tolerant species that are adapted to low light conditions. The diversity of the understory is significantly lower compared to other forest types."

Laterite soils are predominantly found in regions characterized by high rainfall and high temperatures, notably the Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, and central India.  These areas experience significant leaching, resulting in the accumulation of iron and aluminum oxides.\n2.  A continuous expanse of laterite soil is present along the summits of the Western Ghats, ranging from 1000 to 1500 meters in elevation.  This continuous stretch is less pronounced in the Eastern Ghats, Rajmahal Hills, Vindhyas, Satpuras, and the Malwa Plateau.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Laterite soils are indeed formed under conditions of high temperature and heavy rainfall, leading to intense leaching. This process removes bases like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, leaving behind iron and aluminum oxides, which impart the characteristic red color. The Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, and central India represent classic laterite soil zones due to their climatic conditions.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. While laterite soils are scattered across various regions of India, a significant continuous stretch is observed along the higher elevations (1000-1500m) of the Western Ghats. This is because the higher altitudes receive more rainfall and experience cooler temperatures, favoring the conditions for laterite formation. The other mentioned regions have laterite soils, but they are not as continuous or extensive as in the Western Ghats.  The statement accurately captures this difference in the distribution pattern.  Option (c) is therefore the most appropriate choice.\n\n"

The Earth's atmosphere, particularly greenhouse gases, acts as a blanket, trapping some of the outgoing longwave radiation (heat) emitted by the Earth's surface. This process slows down the rate at which the Earth cools during the night, leading to less extreme temperature differences between day and night.  This is crucial for maintaining habitable temperatures and mitigating the otherwise harsh temperature swings that would occur without an atmosphere.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The albedo effect, while seemingly localized in its impact, significantly influences the Earth's overall energy balance and average temperature.  Albedo represents the reflectivity of surfaces; higher albedo means more solar radiation is reflected back into space, leading to cooling.  Conversely, lower albedo means more solar radiation is absorbed, leading to warming. Changes in cloud cover, ice extent, and land use significantly alter Earth's albedo, contributing substantially to climate change.  The statement wrongly diminishes the importance of albedo in the global temperature regulation.\n"

While pressure and density affect the overall behavior of the gas, in an ideal gas of constant composition (a reasonable approximation for relatively small changes in altitude within a single atmospheric layer), the speed of sound is solely dependent on temperature. This is because sound propagates as a wave of compression and rarefaction, and the speed of these pressure waves is governed by the kinetic energy (related to temperature) of the gas molecules.  This relationship is most evident in the troposphere and stratosphere where temperature profiles are relatively well-defined.\n\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Earth's magnetic field plays a crucial role in protecting the atmosphere from atmospheric escape.  The solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the Sun, can strip away lighter gases from a planet's atmosphere.

This protection is particularly important for lighter gases like hydrogen, which have higher escape velocities and are more susceptible to being stripped away by the solar wind.

This is primarily because of the decreasing density of the atmosphere with height.  The air becomes less dense at higher altitudes, meaning there are fewer molecules to absorb and retain heat.  Additionally, the Earth's surface is the primary source of heat, and as you move further away from the surface, the effect of this heat diminishes.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The lapse rate is not constant throughout the atmosphere.  Different atmospheric layers have different lapse rates.  For example, in the stratosphere, the lapse rate is often negative (temperature increases with altitude) due to the absorption of UV radiation by ozone.

The identification of PVTGs by the Government of India relies on several key criteria designed to pinpoint those tribal groups facing the most significant vulnerabilities. These criteria include a pre-agricultural level of technology, indicating a reliance on traditional subsistence methods; low literacy rates, highlighting limited access to education; economic backwardness, reflecting a lack of economic opportunities and resources; and a declining or stagnant population, suggesting a higher risk of community extinction or unsustainable population dynamics.  These factors collectively indicate a high degree of vulnerability and a need for targeted interventions.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  While the exact number of PVTGs can fluctuate slightly depending on updates and revisions to the official list, Odisha consistently holds the highest number of officially recognized PVTG communities. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, due to their geographical proximity and shared cultural characteristics with Odisha, also have a significant number of PVTG communities.  The concentration of PVTGs in these regions reflects specific socio-economic and geographical factors that contribute to their vulnerability.  The high number in these states necessitates focused government attention and resources for the upliftment of these communities.\n"

The Chauhans later gained control,  eventually culminating in Prithviraj Chauhan's reign. This chronological sequence is a well-established fact in Indian history.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While both the Khalji and Mughal dynasties contributed significantly to Delhi's architecture,  the assertion that the Khalji style directly and significantly *influenced* the later Mughal style is an oversimplification.  Mughal architecture, though building upon pre-existing styles, developed its own distinct characteristics under the patronage of different emperors, absorbing and adapting various influences rather than directly inheriting from a single, immediately preceding style like that of the Khaljis.  The evolution was more complex and nuanced than a direct influence.  Therefore, statement 2 presents a misleading simplification of a complex historical process.\n"

The cultivation and export of opium also became a significant source of revenue. This diversification reflects the evolving economic strategies of the Company as it transitioned from a trading entity to a dominant political power.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The \"drain of wealth\" theory highlights the systematic extraction of resources and capital from India during the British Raj. This involved the export of raw materials to British industries at low prices, the underpayment of Indian labor, and the repatriation of profits to Britain.  Investment in India's industrial development was minimal and often served British interests, hindering the growth of a self-sustaining industrial base in India. This economic exploitation contributed significantly to India's underdevelopment during the colonial period.  The imbalance of trade further exacerbated this drain, leaving India impoverished while fueling Britain's industrial revolution.\n"

The Western Ghats, running parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula, are crucial in determining the monsoon rainfall patterns.  As moist monsoon winds from the Arabian Sea encounter these mountains, they are forced to rise, leading to orographic rainfall.  This process results in heavy precipitation on the windward side of the Western Ghats, creating a lush, evergreen environment.  The leeward side experiences a rain shadow effect, resulting in drier conditions. This orographic influence is a key factor in the regional climatic variations and biodiversity of the Western Ghats.\n"

The desert's fauna, including various reptiles and mammals, also exhibits unique adaptations to cope with the harsh environment.  The Sahara\u2019s vastness and harsh conditions have historically limited human settlements.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Taklamakan Desert, located in the Tarim Basin of central Asia, is one of the world's largest sandy deserts.  It is known for its extreme temperatures, with scorching summers and cold winters.  The desert's shifting sand dunes, created by strong winds, constantly reshape its landscape.  The harsh conditions and limited water resources have resulted in sparse human settlements, primarily concentrated in oases along the desert's edges.  The Taklamakan Desert is a significant geographical feature of central Asia.\n"

The East Himalayan region's high rainfall is a result of the moist, north-easterly monsoonal winds which are forced to rise over the mountains causing orographic rainfall. The statement accurately describes the formation of tropical deserts and the rainfall patterns in the East Himalayas.\n"

This symmetrical distribution, reflecting the creation of new crust at the ridge and its subsequent movement outwards, was strong evidence against a static ocean floor.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Harry Hess, building upon earlier work and observations, proposed the seafloor spreading hypothesis.  This hypothesis posited that new oceanic crust is generated at mid-oceanic ridges through volcanic activity. As new crust forms, older crust is pushed laterally away from the ridge.  Crucially, Hess's model included the concept of subduction, where the older oceanic crust sinks beneath continental plates at deep-sea trenches, thus balancing the creation of new crust and preventing the Earth from continuously expanding.  This dynamic process maintains a relatively constant size of the oceans over geological time.\n"

The Coriolis force influences the direction and organization of the winds, but not the speed itself in a directly proportional manner.  A stronger pressure gradient will lead to higher wind speeds, irrespective of the Coriolis force's strength at a given latitude.\n\nStatement 2 is largely correct. Tropical cyclones require warm ocean water exceeding 27\u00b0C, and a significant depth of warm water is crucial. This warm water provides the necessary latent heat energy through evaporation and subsequent condensation, fueling the cyclone's development and intensity.

In tropical cyclones, the influence of upper-level atmospheric flows, including jet streams, is less direct and less well understood compared to temperate cyclones.  While upper-level divergence can enhance tropical cyclone intensification, the direct interaction with jet streams is less pronounced than in temperate systems.  In contrast, temperate cyclones demonstrate a clear and strong connection with upper-level atmospheric patterns, specifically jet streams and Rossby waves. These large-scale atmospheric features play a critical role in steering the movement of temperate cyclones, influencing their intensification or weakening, and shaping their overall evolution.  The interaction between upper-level jet streams and the lower-level frontal systems of temperate cyclones is a defining characteristic.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Plantation agriculture, characterized by large-scale monoculture farming, thrives in regions with consistent climatic conditions suitable for specific crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, cocoa, and palm oil. Equatorial regions, with their consistently high temperatures, abundant rainfall, and high humidity, offer ideal growing environments for many of these plantation crops.  The year-round growing season allows for continuous harvests and higher productivity.  The availability of cheap labor in many equatorial regions also contributes to the economic viability of plantation agriculture.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While labor costs can vary across different equatorial regions, the overall cost of labor is typically *low* in many equatorial regions compared to developed countries. This low labor cost is a major factor contributing to the profitability of plantation agriculture.  However, other factors such as transportation costs, market fluctuations, and pest management can also influence profitability.  The statement incorrectly suggests that high labor costs are a limiting factor.\n\nOptions (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 is correct, and statement 2 is false.\n"

The air then descends on the leeward side, becoming compressed and warmed, creating the Foehn effect. The Alps are a classic example of where this wind is experienced.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Bora wind is another example of a local wind, but unlike the Foehn, it is a cold, strong, and often gusty wind.  It is associated with the Adriatic coast, where cold air masses from the continent descend rapidly down the slopes of the Dinaric Alps.

This is because during winter, the region is positioned within the path of the westerly winds. These winds transport relatively moist air masses from the Atlantic Ocean towards the Mediterranean, resulting in increased rainfall. The subtropical high-pressure belt shifts southward during the winter months, allowing the westerly winds to dominate and bring moisture to the region.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The ports of northwestern Europe remain ice-free throughout the year because of the moderating influence of the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current that flows from the Gulf of Mexico northward along the eastern coast of North America and then across the Atlantic Ocean towards northwestern Europe.  This warm current keeps the coastal waters relatively warm, preventing them from freezing even during winter. The prevailing southwesterly winds from the Atlantic also help to moderate temperatures and prevent extreme cold conditions.\n"

This absorption prevents much of this radiation from reaching the Earth's surface, protecting life from its damaging effects. While a small portion of ozone also exists in the troposphere, the majority resides in the stratosphere, forming the so-called \"ozone layer\".  The depletion of this layer due to human-made chemicals like CFCs has been a major environmental concern.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The ionosphere, located within the thermosphere, is a region where solar radiation ionizes atmospheric particles, creating electrically charged ions. This ionization is responsible for the reflection of radio waves, making long-distance radio communication possible.  The ionosphere's behavior is affected by solar activity, resulting in variations in radio wave propagation.  Different layers within the ionosphere reflect different radio frequencies.\n"

Some areas within the ITCZ might experience periods of drier conditions depending on the seasonal location of the convergence zone.  The ITCZ is also associated with the formation of tropical cyclones.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The terms \"roaring forties,\" \"furious fifties,\" and \"shrieking sixties\" are used to describe the powerful westerly winds that dominate the Southern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes (approximately 40\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 South). These winds are particularly strong due to the lack of significant landmasses to interrupt their flow, resulting in a nearly uninterrupted circumpolar current of air.  These winds play a significant role in global atmospheric circulation and influence weather patterns in the Southern Hemisphere.\n"

Wind waves are characterized by relatively short wavelengths and are influenced significantly by the depth of the water; their energy is concentrated near the surface.  Tsunami waves, however, possess extremely long wavelengths (hundreds of kilometers) which means that even in deep ocean water, their wave base interacts with the seafloor. This interaction causes them to behave as shallow-water waves, meaning that their speed is controlled by water depth rather than wavelength. This also contributes to their high speeds.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The shoaling effect is a crucial feature of tsunamis. As a tsunami wave approaches the coast and enters shallower waters, the wave base interacts more strongly with the seafloor. This friction slows the wave down, forcing the wave to compress and increase in height. This dramatic increase in height, sometimes reaching tens of meters, is the primary cause of the devastating coastal damage associated with tsunamis.  The increasing wave height in shallow water is a direct consequence of the wave's long wavelength and shallow-water wave behavior.  This makes coastal regions disproportionately vulnerable compared to open ocean areas.\n"

The relationship is not strictly linear; the Coriolis effect's increase is more complex and depends on the latitude and velocity of the wind.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While warm ocean surfaces above 27\u00b0C are a necessary condition for tropical cyclone formation (providing the latent heat energy through evaporation),  the statement makes an overgeneralization. Not all tropical cyclones develop a clearly defined \"eye\" especially in their early stages.  The \"eye\" is a feature that forms as the cyclone matures, and even then, its characteristics can vary significantly.  Furthermore, the presence of descending air in the eye is true, but the description is too simplistic, neglecting the crucial role of updrafts and the complex air circulation patterns within the cyclone.\n"

The Coriolis force is indeed an inertial or fictitious force, meaning it's not a \"real\" force like gravity but rather an effect of observing motion in a rotating reference frame (the Earth).  Its influence is most noticeable on large-scale systems because the effect scales with the time and distance over which the object is moving.  This is why it significantly affects the rotation of weather systems like cyclones and the deflection of ocean currents and trade winds but is practically imperceptible on smaller scales like water draining in a sink.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The magnitude of the Coriolis force is directly proportional to the velocity of the moving object (wind, current, etc.).  It's zero at the equator (because the object is not moving relative to the axis of rotation) and increases with latitude, reaching its maximum at the poles. This latitudinal variation is a crucial factor in the formation and movement of tropical cyclones, which are deflected due to the Coriolis force. Similarly, trade winds are deflected by the Coriolis force, creating their characteristic patterns.\n\n"

The strong vertical winds tear apart the developing thunderstorm clusters preventing the formation of a coherent cyclonic structure. Upper-level divergence, on the other hand, is beneficial; it draws air upward from the surface, enhancing the low-pressure area at the surface and promoting the development of stronger updrafts, leading to intensification.  This divergence helps to maintain and strengthen the low-pressure system at the surface.\n"

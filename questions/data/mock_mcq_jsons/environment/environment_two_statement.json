Their activity patterns show a mix of diurnal and crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk) behaviours,  adapting to the specific environmental conditions and food availability in their habitat.  Their activity is not solely confined to daylight hours.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Malabar Civet is indeed classified as Critically Endangered (CR) by the IUCN Red List, reflecting its highly vulnerable status.  Furthermore, Malabar Civets are largely nocturnal animals, meaning their main period of activity is at night. This nocturnal behaviour is a common adaptation among many civet species, helping them avoid predators and compete for resources.\n"

Statement 1 accurately reflects that Varroa mites primarily infest honeybee brood (larvae and pupae), feeding on their hemolymph (insect blood). This parasitic feeding weakens the developing bees, leading to deformities, reduced lifespan, and increased susceptibility to diseases. This can ultimately contribute to colony collapse.\n\nStatement 2 also correctly describes a major consequence of Varroa mite infestations. Severe infestations lead to a decline in honey production as the weakened colonies are less efficient at foraging and storing honey.  Furthermore, the weakened state of the hive makes it vulnerable to other stresses, such as diseases and harsh weather conditions, potentially leading to complete colony failure.\n"

It's inaccurate to make a blanket statement about all mushrooms.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.

Wildfires, often intensified by global warming itself, release significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Both these processes create positive feedback loops, accelerating the rate of global warming.  The release of these greenhouse gases from these sources significantly contributes to the overall increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, driving further warming.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the Kyoto Protocol aimed to mitigate global warming, its primary mechanism was not carbon sequestration.  The protocol focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors, primarily through setting emission reduction targets for industrialized countries.  Carbon sequestration, while important for climate change mitigation, was not the central strategy of the Kyoto Protocol.  The protocol's focus on emission reduction reflects the understanding that limiting the source of greenhouse gas emissions is crucial to slowing the rate of global warming."

Tropical regions, near the equator, generally exhibit greater species richness due to factors like longer evolutionary history, more stable climates, and higher primary productivity, providing more resources to support a wider array of species.  Statement 2 is also correct;  the Himalayan mountain range demonstrates an altitudinal biodiversity gradient.  As altitude increases, temperature decreases, resulting in harsher climatic conditions and a reduction in suitable habitats for many species. This leads to a decrease in species richness and overall biodiversity at higher elevations. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don't recognize the validity of both statements, which represent key concepts in biogeography and ecology.

It is a relatively heavy and viscous fuel, typically used in industrial boilers, power generation, and other high-temperature applications. The composition of furnace oil can vary depending on the crude oil source and the refining process, but it generally contains a significant amount of sulfur and other impurities.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Furnace oil typically has a relatively high sulfur content, and its combustion can lead to significant sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) emissions.  This is a significant environmental concern because SO\u2082 is a major contributor to acid rain and air pollution. While some modern furnace oils have lower sulfur content due to refining techniques, the combustion of furnace oil generally results in higher sulfur emissions than the use of cleaner fuels like natural gas.  The sulfur content of furnace oil is a significant factor in its environmental impact.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. While the primary emissions from copper smelting are sulfur dioxide and other heavy metals, carbon monoxide (CO) is also produced as a byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuels used for the smelting process.  Incomplete combustion, particularly in older or less efficient smelters, can result in significant CO emissions.  High concentrations of CO are toxic and can be lethal.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Copper slag is a waste product containing various heavy metals that were present in the original ore.  These metals can leach into the surrounding environment, particularly through contact with water.  This leaching process contaminates soil and water bodies, posing a significant risk to human health and the environment.  Arsenic, lead, and cadmium are particularly toxic heavy metals found in copper slag, and their presence in the environment requires careful management and remediation strategies.\n"

The presence of moisture in the air facilitates the formation of sulfuric acid, contributing to the smog's characteristic properties and harmful effects.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Photochemical smog, also known as Los Angeles-type smog, is formed under warm, sunny conditions. It is primarily caused by the photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight.  These reactions produce secondary pollutants like ozone (O3), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and other oxidants, which are major components of photochemical smog and have adverse health and environmental effects.  The formation of photochemical smog is significantly influenced by meteorological conditions and the presence of sunlight."

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Mercury is indeed a heavy metal, and a significant contributor to water contamination.  Industrial processes, such as the chlor-alkali industry and coal combustion, release substantial amounts of mercury into the atmosphere, which then settles into water bodies. Mining activities, particularly of cinnabar (mercury sulfide), also directly contaminate water sources.  This mercury then enters the food chain, undergoing bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms, posing a serious threat to human health through consumption of contaminated fish and seafood.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Methylmercury, a highly toxic organic form of mercury, is especially dangerous to children because their nervous systems are still developing.  Exposure to methylmercury during prenatal development or early childhood can lead to severe neurological damage, including developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and cerebral palsy.  The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, making it a critical public health concern.  The fact that it biomagnifies up the food chain makes this an even greater threat.\n"

However, it is crucial to note that adults also experience health consequences from lead exposure, including kidney damage, neurological issues, and cardiovascular problems, though often at higher exposure levels.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While leaded petrol has been phased out in many countries, its legacy continues to pose a significant environmental challenge.  Lead persists in soil and sediment for long periods, and its release continues through erosion and other environmental processes.  Furthermore, lead is still used in many industrial applications, and informal recycling of lead-acid batteries contributes to ongoing pollution in many parts of the world.  So, while the phasing out of leaded gasoline was a crucial step, it did not eliminate lead pollution globally.\n"

This makes it a crucial target for emission reduction strategies focusing on immediate climate impact.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Agricultural activities, especially the use of nitrogen fertilizers, are a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.  N2O has a very long atmospheric lifetime and a high global warming potential.  The statement accurately reflects the significant contribution of agriculture to N2O emissions and the observed increase since 1980, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable agricultural practices.\n"

Primary succession starts in areas completely lacking life, such as newly formed volcanic islands, glacial moraines, or exposed rock surfaces.  Pioneer species, such as lichens and mosses, colonize these barren substrates, gradually modifying the environment to allow for the establishment of more complex communities. Secondary succession, on the other hand, follows a disturbance that removes existing vegetation, such as a fire, flood, or human activity.  The soil and some organisms remain, allowing for faster recovery and succession compared to primary succession.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The climax community is the relatively stable and self-sustaining community that develops at the end of succession.  The nature of the climax community is determined by various factors, most importantly climate (temperature, rainfall, etc.) and soil conditions.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately describes an ecotone.  Ecotones are zones of transition between two adjacent ecosystems (e.g., a forest and a grassland).  They often exhibit a greater species richness and density than either of the adjoining ecosystems. This is due to the \"edge effect,\" where the unique environmental conditions of the ecotone create habitats suitable for a wider variety of species, including those from both adjacent ecosystems as well as species specifically adapted to the ecotone itself.\n\nStatement 2 correctly defines homeostasis in an ecosystem.  Ecosystems, despite being dynamic systems, possess a remarkable ability to maintain a relatively stable internal environment (equilibrium) despite external disturbances and fluctuations. This self-regulating capacity is known as homeostasis.  It is achieved through various feedback mechanisms, where changes in one component trigger responses that counteract the initial change, helping to maintain the overall stability of the ecosystem.  For example, if herbivore populations increase, they may initially overgraze, leading to a decrease in plant populations, which in turn reduces the food source for herbivores, eventually causing their population to decline.  This is a negative feedback loop contributing to ecosystem homeostasis.  However, the capacity for homeostasis is not unlimited; severe or prolonged disturbances can overwhelm an ecosystem's ability to maintain stability."

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Endosulfan, along with Chlordane, Endrin, and Heptachlor, are indeed classified as pesticides.  India, recognizing their severe toxicity and detrimental effects on human health and the environment, including biodiversity loss, has banned their use.  The persistent nature of organochlorine pesticides like Endosulfan leads to bioaccumulation in the food chain, causing long-term damage to ecosystems.  Therefore, the statement accurately reflects the impact of certain pesticides on biodiversity.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While organic farming significantly reduces or eliminates the use of synthetic pesticides, it doesn't guarantee a complete absence of any pesticide use.  Organic farming allows for the use of certain naturally derived pesticides and pest control methods, although these are strictly regulated and must meet specific criteria.  The complete elimination of all pest control measures is often not feasible or desirable, even in organic farming systems, as pests can still significantly impact crop yields. Therefore,  the claim that organic farming ensures zero harm to biodiversity is an oversimplification.  Organic farming aims to minimize harm, but complete elimination is not always achieved.\n"

The SDGs are a comprehensive set of 17 goals that address a wide range of global challenges, including poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, gender equality, peace, justice, and economic growth. The SDGs recognize that sustainable development is not solely an environmental issue; rather, it requires a multi-faceted approach that incorporates economic prosperity, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.  To claim that the SDGs focus *exclusively* on environmental issues disregards their broad scope and the explicit inclusion of economic and social dimensions.  The interconnected nature of the goals underscores this holistic approach to sustainable development.\n"

This framework allows for flexibility in setting emission reduction targets, tailored to the specific circumstances of each country.\n\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Kyoto Protocol, a key agreement adopted under the UNFCCC, did establish legally binding emission reduction targets for developed countries.  This protocol, adopted in 1997, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a certain percentage compared to 1990 levels.  The Kyoto Protocol's significance lies in its introduction of legally binding commitments, although its implementation faced challenges and limitations. It represents a landmark effort to translate the general framework of the UNFCCC into specific, legally enforceable actions for emission reduction, primarily targeting developed nations based on the principle of historical responsibility.  However, the protocol's effectiveness was debated due to the absence of commitments from some major emitters.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Magnesium is an essential element for both photosynthesis and respiration. In photosynthesis, it's a central component of chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for capturing light energy.  Without sufficient magnesium, chlorophyll synthesis is impaired, leading to reduced photosynthetic rates. In respiration, magnesium acts as a cofactor for various enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways that generate energy from organic molecules.  Its role in enzyme function is critical for efficient energy production.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Temperate grasslands have lower NPP than tropical rainforests and other biomes due to several factors. The shorter growing season limits the duration of photosynthetic activity. Less precipitation restricts plant growth and biomass accumulation. Additionally, temperate grasslands often have less fertile soils, further reducing their capacity for primary production.  These combined factors result in a significantly lower rate of energy capture and storage as biomass, hence the lower NPP.\n"

While the open ocean covers a vast area, its NPP per unit area is significantly lower (125 tons/km\u00b2/year) than many other ecosystems. This is primarily due to nutrient limitations in the open ocean's waters.  Nutrients are often scarce in the photic zone where sunlight penetrates, limiting the growth of phytoplankton, the primary producers in this environment.  Furthermore, light penetration decreases rapidly with depth, further restricting photosynthetic activity to a relatively thin surface layer.\n"

Phytoplankton's greater abundance and faster growth rates allow them to dominate primary production in the vast majority of the marine environment. While seaweeds are important primary producers, particularly in shallower, well-lit areas, their distribution is limited by factors like light penetration and nutrient availability. Their slower growth rates compared to phytoplankton result in a smaller overall contribution to global marine primary productivity.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Zooplankton are indeed heterotrophic, meaning they obtain energy by consuming other organisms.  Their primary food source is phytoplankton, making them a critical link in the marine food web. They transfer energy from the primary producers (phytoplankton) to higher trophic levels, such as small fish, which are then consumed by larger fish and other predators. This highlights zooplankton's crucial role in the flow of energy and nutrients within marine ecosystems.\n"

Their towering height acts as a significant barrier, preventing the intrusion of cold, dry air masses from Central Asia during the winter months. This orographic effect results in a relatively warmer climate in the northern plains compared to regions at similar latitudes in Central Asia.  The Himalayas also play a role in the formation of the Indian monsoon by influencing the movement of air masses.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Deccan Plateau, a large and elevated landmass in peninsular India, significantly influences the regional climate and the formation of agro-ecological zones. Its elevation creates variations in temperature and rainfall patterns across the region. The plateau's presence leads to a rain shadow effect on the leeward side, resulting in drier conditions.  The diverse geological formations and soil types across the Deccan Plateau further contribute to the formation of distinct agro-ecological zones, supporting a variety of crops and agricultural practices.  This diversity is a key feature of India's agricultural landscape.\n"

This process is fundamental to the base of most food chains and the overall oxygen balance of the planet.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Atmospheric nitrogen (N\u2082) exists as a diatomic molecule with a strong triple bond, making it largely unreactive and unavailable for direct use by most organisms.  Nitrogen fixation, a process carried out by specialized bacteria and archaea, is essential to convert atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms like ammonia (NH\u2083) and nitrates (NO\u2083\u207b) that can be assimilated by plants and subsequently move through the food chain.

The rate of carbon release from these reservoirs is significantly slower than the rate of utilization by living organisms, leading to imbalances, particularly exacerbated by human activities like the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The phosphorus cycle is primarily a sedimentary cycle, meaning its main reservoir is the Earth's crust.  Unlike carbon or nitrogen, phosphorus does not have a significant gaseous phase in its biogeochemical cycle.

While sand mining can alter the river's morphology and flow patterns, it doesn't directly increase the salt content of the river water.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Extensive sand mining significantly alters the riverbed's structure and permeability. The removal of sand can lead to increased porosity and permeability in the riverbed, resulting in a faster rate of groundwater recharge. However, this effect is often localized and may not always lead to a significant rise in the water table.  Conversely, in areas where sand mining depletes the aquifer's natural recharge capacity, it can contribute to a lowering of the water table.

        "option_d": "Neither 1 nor 2\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Acid rain, a significant environmental problem, is indeed caused by the atmospheric deposition of acidic compounds like nitrous and nitric acids, as well as sulphurous and sulfuric acids, formed from nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide. These acids significantly alter soil chemistry, causing nutrient leaching\u2014the removal of essential nutrients from the soil\u2014and ultimately leading to soil infertility.  This infertility directly impacts agricultural productivity and crop yields, resulting in reduced harvests and potentially impacting food security. The causal chain from emissions to soil degradation and reduced yields is well established scientifically.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The Taj Mahal, constructed primarily from marble, a form of limestone, is highly susceptible to damage from acid rain.  The acidic components of acid rain react chemically with the calcium carbonate in the marble, leading to its erosion and deterioration. This process, often termed \"marble cancer,\" causes significant damage to the aesthetic and structural integrity of the monument, requiring ongoing conservation efforts. The chemical composition of marble and the known effects of acid rain on carbonate materials directly support this statement.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Biomass is indeed a renewable energy source, encompassing various organic materials such as agricultural residues (sugarcane press mud, cattle dung, etc.). However, its direct combustion, especially in inefficient systems, releases considerable air pollutants.  These pollutants include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and various other harmful gases, contributing to air pollution and potentially impacting human health and the environment.  The renewable nature of biomass is balanced by its potential for significant air pollution if not managed properly.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis are two different thermochemical conversion methods used to process biomass. Anaerobic digestion is a biological process that converts organic matter into biogas (containing methane), while pyrolysis involves high-temperature decomposition in the absence of oxygen, generating bio-oil, biochar, and syngas. Both processes can be used to produce biofuels, including biobutanol, which can serve as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. While these processes can reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels, they may still have associated environmental impacts depending on the technology and feedstock used.\n"

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Coal combustion in thermal power plants is a major source of fly ash. This ash is not inert; it contains a range of toxic heavy metals, including mercury, cadmium, and arsenic. These metals are not evenly distributed in the ash and can leach into water bodies, contaminating surface water and groundwater. This contamination poses risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health through bioaccumulation in the food chain. The presence of these heavy metals in fly ash is well documented and a significant environmental concern.\n\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The burning of coal releases substantial quantities of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming.  In addition to carbon dioxide, the combustion process also emits sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen.  These gases are precursors to acid rain, which damages ecosystems, buildings, and infrastructure.  Furthermore, these pollutants directly contribute to respiratory problems and other health issues in humans. The combined impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, acid rain, and direct air pollution from coal combustion represent a significant environmental and public health challenge.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Kerosene, a relatively inexpensive petroleum product, is unfortunately frequently adulterated with cheaper fuels like diesel or gasoline to increase profit margins. This adulteration significantly degrades the quality of the fuel, leading to incomplete combustion in engines. Incomplete combustion results in higher emissions of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (a toxic gas), nitrogen oxides (contribute to smog and acid rain), and particulate matter (harmful to respiratory health).  The economic incentives for adulteration and the resulting environmental consequences are a serious concern.\n\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The Indian government has implemented several schemes to reduce kerosene consumption, primarily focusing on providing cleaner cooking alternatives and access to electricity. The Ujjwala Yojana, for instance, provides free LPG connections to below-poverty-line households, shifting them from traditional biomass fuels like wood and dung to a cleaner fuel source.  Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya) aims to provide electricity connections to all households, reducing reliance on kerosene for lighting. These initiatives directly address both the environmental and public health challenges associated with kerosene use.  The existence and aims of these schemes are matters of public record and policy.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Carbon monoxide (CO) is a classic example of a primary air pollutant. It is directly emitted from various sources, including incomplete combustion in vehicles and industrial processes.  Ozone (O3), on the other hand, is a secondary pollutant.  It is not directly emitted but is formed in the atmosphere through complex photochemical reactions involving sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This formation process distinguishes it as a secondary pollutant, resulting from chemical transformations of primary pollutants.\n\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The distinction between qualitative and quantitative pollutants is crucial in understanding air pollution sources and control strategies. Qualitative pollutants, such as many synthetic pesticides and industrial chemicals, are entirely anthropogenic (human-made). They do not exist naturally in the environment. Quantitative pollutants, conversely, have natural sources but become pollutants when their concentrations exceed certain thresholds. Carbon dioxide (CO2), for example, is essential for plant life and naturally present in the atmosphere, but its elevated levels due to human activities contribute significantly to climate change and air pollution.  This fundamental difference in origin and behavior guides the approaches to pollution mitigation.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Magnetite (Fe3O4), a magnetic iron oxide, is used as a component in brake pads of motor vehicles.  Friction during braking generates fine magnetite particles that are released into the environment.  These particles, along with those released from other sources like power plants, are inhalable and can accumulate in the body's tissues.

The use of magnetite in brake pads and its potential health impacts are key aspects of this statement.\n\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Copper smelting is an industrial process involving the extraction of copper from its ores. Many copper ores contain significant amounts of sulfides.  The smelting process, which involves high temperatures, releases sulphur dioxide (SO2) as a byproduct.  Sulphur dioxide is a major air pollutant.  It is a respiratory irritant and contributes significantly to acid rain, damaging ecosystems and infrastructure.  The process of copper smelting, the release of sulphur dioxide, and its environmental consequences are all well-established facts.\n"

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, was initially a broad piece of legislation that encompassed various forms of pollution, including noise pollution.  However, as understanding of noise pollution and its distinct impacts grew, the need for more specific regulations became apparent.  This led to the enactment of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, which provides a more focused and comprehensive regulatory framework for managing noise pollution.  The evolution of noise pollution regulations from being part of the broader Air Act to a separate set of rules reflects the increasing awareness of its importance.\n\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  While the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, provide a primary regulatory framework for noise, the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, plays a supplementary role.  The 1986 Act empowers the government to set standards for various pollutants and sources, including noise.  This allows for the establishment of specific noise emission limits for different types of equipment, such as motor vehicles, air conditioners, and diesel generators.  This dual regulatory approach, with the 2000 Rules focusing on noise pollution management and the 1986 Act providing a broader framework for environmental protection including noise standards, ensures a more effective regulatory system.\n"

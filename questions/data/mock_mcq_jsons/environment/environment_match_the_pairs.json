Habitat rights under the Forest Rights Act are not solely decided and declared by the Union Ministry; Gram Sabhas play a crucial role in identifying and claiming these rights. Lastly, while Scheduled Tribes are entitled to several rights under the FRA, including Community Forest Rights, the statement oversimplifies the process and extent of these rights. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, requiring a detailed knowledge of its provisions and their application.  The use of plausible incorrect options significantly increases the difficulty.\n"

Schedule I offers the highest level of protection, encompassing critically endangered species.  The Indian Wild Ass is indeed listed under Schedule I.  Schedule II includes species requiring special protection, and while Rhesus Macaques might be a protected species in some regions under state wildlife acts, their inclusion in Schedule II of the WPA is not consistently accurate across all states and regions. Wild Buffalo can also be found in Schedule I in certain regions, but not always consistently. The Gharial, while critically endangered and protected, is not typically listed under Schedule V, which designates vermin species that can be hunted without restrictions. Schedule V is generally for species considered pests or a threat to human interests. Thus, only the pairing of Schedule I with the Indian Wild Ass is definitively and consistently accurate according to the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.  The other options include species that may have varying protection statuses depending on regional or state-level regulations or may be listed under other schedules.\n"

This leads to a decrease in ocean pH, affecting marine life.  Pair 1 is correctly matched. Desertification, the process of land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, is often driven by deforestation, which reduces soil stability and moisture retention. Pair 2 is therefore correct. Waterlogging, the saturation of soil with water, is frequently a consequence of faulty irrigation practices, leading to the accumulation of excess water in the soil.  Pair 3 is correctly matched. Soil erosion is a natural process accelerated by human activities. Wind and water are the primary agents of soil erosion, removing topsoil and reducing soil fertility.  Pair 4 is therefore correct. While volcanic eruptions can release sulfur dioxide, contributing to acid rain, the primary cause of acid rain is the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from human activities, primarily industrial processes and combustion of fossil fuels.

The decay of organic matter, particularly in anaerobic conditions, produces methane and carbon dioxide as well as other gases. The combustion of fossil fuels, primarily coal, oil, and natural gas, releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched. Option 3 is partially correct, as volcanoes release methane but other gases are also released in larger quantities. Option 4 is also partially correct as nitrous oxide is a product of decomposition, but methane and carbon dioxide are more significant products.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the primary gases involved in each process.\n"

Coal combustion, while primarily releasing carbon dioxide, also produces methane as a byproduct, especially if the coal has high moisture content or if incomplete combustion occurs.  Rice paddies are significant sources of methane, not nitrous oxide.  Livestock, particularly cattle, are major emitters of methane and carbon dioxide. Landfills primarily emit methane through anaerobic decomposition of organic waste. Wastewater treatment plants release various gases, including methane and ammonia, but sulphur dioxide is not a typical emission.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall the primary and secondary gaseous emissions from different sources. The use of distractors like nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide tests the candidate's specific knowledge of emission sources.  The question is difficult because it requires both general understanding of emission sources and detailed knowledge of specific emissions.\n"

The burning of coal, a significant source of energy globally, releases substantial amounts of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide (especially when combustion is incomplete).  Anaerobic digestion, a crucial process in waste management and biogas production, results in the release of methane.  Finally, ozone is a secondary pollutant formed through complex photochemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. This process is a key component of photochemical smog formation, a significant air quality concern in many urban areas.

Diesel fuel, while more efficient in terms of energy per unit volume than CNG, does not possess a higher calorific value (energy content per unit mass).  In fact, CNG generally has a higher calorific value than diesel.  Finally, while leaded gasoline was once common, modern petrol (gasoline) is largely unleaded.

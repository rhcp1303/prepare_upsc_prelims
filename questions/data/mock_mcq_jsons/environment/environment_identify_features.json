Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is essential for farmers and applicators to minimize exposure to harmful pesticides.  Pesticides are sometimes used to accelerate fruit ripening, although this practice is increasingly scrutinized due to potential health concerns. Agroecological practices, which prioritize sustainable agriculture, generally aim to minimize or eliminate the use of synthetic pesticides.

Its primary aim is to prevent the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. Thus, statement 1 is directly related to mitigating deforestation.\n\nThe Leader\u2019s Declaration on Forests and Land Use is an international agreement focused on halting deforestation and forest degradation.

Therefore, statement 2 is also directly relevant.\n\nThe Amazon Fund is a dedicated financial mechanism specifically designed to combat deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. It channels funds into various conservation projects, aiming to preserve the region's vast forest cover.  This makes statement 3 pertinent.\n\nBiomass energy production, while a renewable energy source, can indirectly contribute to deforestation if unsustainable harvesting practices are employed.

Plankton absorb pollutants from their surroundings, accumulating them in their tissues. This is a crucial first step in the process of biomagnification.\n\nBiomagnification is the progressive increase in the concentration of persistent pollutants as they move up the aquatic food chain.  As predators consume prey containing pollutants, the concentration of pollutants in their bodies increases with each trophic level. This directly contributes to higher concentrations in top predators.\n\nCatabolism is the metabolic breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones. While it plays a role in the overall metabolism of organisms, it doesn't directly contribute to the *increase* in pollutant concentration in top predators.  In fact, it might contribute to the *decrease* of pollutants, if the pollutants are broken down.\n\nExcretion of water-soluble pollutants is a process that removes pollutants from an organism's body.  This process would actually *reduce* the concentration of pollutants, particularly those soluble in water.  Persistent pollutants are often fat-soluble, and thus not readily excreted.\n\nTherefore, only bioaccumulation and biomagnification directly contribute to the increasing concentration of persistent pollutants in top predators.\n"

The removal of forest cover eliminates the homes and food sources of countless plant and animal species, leading to population declines and extinctions.\n\nContribution to climate change is a direct consequence of deforestation. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Deforestation reduces the planet's capacity to absorb this greenhouse gas, thus worsening climate change.\n\nDisruption of nutrient cycles is a direct consequence of deforestation. Forests play a vital role in nutrient cycling.  Deforestation disrupts this process, impacting soil fertility and ecosystem health.\n\nDisplacement of indigenous communities is a direct consequence of deforestation, especially when forest land is converted for agriculture, mining, or other development activities.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct:  Globally, habitat destruction is the primary driver of biodiversity loss, but invasive species are a close second, causing significant ecological damage and species extinctions.  Statement 2 is correct: Invasive species have significantly contributed to the degradation and destruction of Shola vegetation, a unique type of montane forest ecosystem found in the Western Ghats of India. The introduction of non-native plants alters the delicate balance of the ecosystem, leading to habitat loss for native flora and fauna. Statement 3 is also correct: The Painted Stork, a significant bird species in India, faces threats from invasive species that compete for resources and alter its breeding habitats.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the impact of invasive species on Indian biodiversity.

While all the listed factors impact India's marine environment, three are directly linked to HABs:\n\n*   **Discharge of nutrients from estuaries (3):** Estuaries, where rivers meet the sea, often carry high nutrient loads from agricultural runoff and sewage. This nutrient enrichment directly fuels algal growth.\n*   **Run-off from the land during the monsoon (2):** Monsoon rains carry fertilizers, pesticides, and other pollutants from agricultural lands into coastal waters, further increasing nutrient levels.\n*   **Upwelling in the seas (1):** While upwelling brings nutrient-rich deep waters to the surface, it can also lead to excessive nutrient concentration in certain areas, promoting algal blooms if other conditions are favorable.\n\nHabitat destruction, overexploitation of resources, and climate change contribute to broader environmental degradation but are not the direct causes of HABs. Therefore, the correct option is (c). Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either under or overestimate the number of factors directly contributing to HABs.

        "option_b": "Only two\n",
        "option_c": "Only three\n",
        "option_d": "All four\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nCNG is a common alternative to petrol and diesel, particularly in public transport. Biodiesel is an alternative to conventional diesel fuel, derived from renewable sources. H-CNG (hydrogen-enriched CNG) is being explored as a further refinement of CNG to improve its efficiency.  However, the use of lead (Tetraethyl lead) in petrol has been phased out in most countries due to its toxicity.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.\n"

The Ganga Action Plan primarily focuses on improving water quality to bathing class standards.\n2. The National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) is a broader initiative encompassing more rivers than the Ganga Action Plan.\n3. The Stockholm Convention addresses Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).\n4. The Basel Convention completely bans the international trade of hazardous waste.\n\n\nHow many of the statements above are factually correct?\n",
        "option_a": "Only one\n",
        "option_b": "Only two\n",
        "option_c": "Only three\n",
        "option_d": "All four\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe Ganga Action Plan (GAP) aimed to improve the water quality of the Ganga river to acceptable standards, including \"bathing class\" standards. The National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) expanded upon the GAP to include other major rivers in India. The Stockholm Convention is an international treaty that aims to regulate and phase out POPs.  However, the Basel Convention does *not* completely ban the international trade of hazardous waste; it aims to regulate and control such movements, requiring prior informed consent.  Therefore, only three statements are fully accurate.\n"

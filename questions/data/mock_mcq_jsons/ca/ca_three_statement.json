Ahilyabai Holkar, who ruled in the 17th century, significantly expanded the Maratha Empire's territory in the Deccan region.\n2.

        "explanation": "\n\nAll three statements contain inaccuracies.  Statement 1 incorrectly places Ahilyabai Holkar's reign in the 17th century; she ruled during the 18th century.  While she did rule Malwa, a part of the Maratha Empire, her administration was known for its *centralized* system, not decentralized as suggested in Statement 2.  Statement 3 is incorrect because, although she did extensive temple renovations, her projects were spread across India and included temples dedicated to various deities, not solely Shiva in South India.  Her reconstruction of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and the Somnath Temple in Gujarat are notable examples.  The emphasis on decentralized administration and exclusive focus on Shiva temples in South India are deliberate distractors designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of Ahilyabai Holkar's rule.\n"

It had its own internal economic dynamism, particularly in textiles.  Statement 2 is incorrect because, while the Maheshwari sari did originate in Maheshwar during Ahilyabai Holkar's time, it was primarily patronized by the local population and Maratha court, not the Mughal court.  Statement 3 is largely correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage indeed boosted the Maheshwar textile industry, contributing to the region's economic well-being. However, the suggestion of a sharp decline immediately after her death requires nuance; the industry's fate was influenced by various factors beyond royal patronage in subsequent years.\n"

Part XVIII of the Constitution of India deals with emergency provisions, including the National Emergency (Article 352), President's Rule (Article 356), and Financial Emergency (Article 360).  These provisions outline the circumstances under which the normal functioning of the Constitution can be temporarily suspended or modified to address exceptional situations.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Although war or external aggression are grounds for declaring a National Emergency, they are not the only grounds.  The President can also declare such an emergency if there is a threat to the security of India or any part of it, whether from internal disturbances or otherwise.  This broader interpretation allows the government to respond to a wider range of threats.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  While a National Emergency can lead to the suspension of fundamental rights, it doesn't automatically suspend *all* fundamental rights.  The suspension of fundamental rights is done through a separate order by the President, and even then, certain fundamental rights (like Articles 20 and 21) cannot be suspended.  The extent of suspension depends on the specific circumstances and the government's assessment of the threat.  The Supreme Court's role in judicial review also plays a significant part in limiting the scope of such suspensions.\n"

PMJVK, a centrally sponsored scheme, aims to reduce developmental deficits in minority concentration areas (where the minority population exceeds 15% within a 15 km radius) by providing financial assistance for community asset creation, excluding infrastructure projects.\n2.  The scheme, formerly known as the Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP), targets all districts, including aspirational districts, and benefits all minority communities notified under the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992.  NITI Aayog designates it as a Core of the Core Scheme.\n3.  PMJVK provides demand-driven financial assistance for infrastructure development focusing on community assets; these assets are exclusively for the use of minority communities within the catchment areas.  The scheme's monitoring involves National, State, and District level Monitoring Committees.\n\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  While the scheme does aim to reduce developmental deficits in minority concentration areas and provides financial assistance for community asset creation, the minority population threshold is 25%, not 15%, within a 15 km radius. The statement also incorrectly excludes infrastructure projects; infrastructure is a key component.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The historical context (MsDP restructuring), the target coverage (all districts, including aspirational ones), beneficiary groups (all notified minority communities), and NITI Aayog's designation are all accurately described.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The assets created under PMJVK are for the use of *all* communities in the catchment area, not exclusively minority communities. The monitoring mechanism by the committees is accurately described.\n\nTherefore, only Statement 2 is completely correct, making (a) the correct answer. Statements 1 and 3 misrepresent key aspects of the scheme's target beneficiaries and asset usage.\n"

JJM, a centrally sponsored scheme, aims to provide Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTCs) to every rural household by 2024, prioritizing districts affected by Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES).  Funding is contingent upon state contribution and utilization of central funds.\n2.  The scheme promotes decentralized planning through Village Action Plans (VAPs) focusing on water sources, greywater reuse, and system operation & maintenance.  Paani Samitis, with at least 50% women members, are responsible for system operation and maintenance.\n3.  JJM uses the JJM-WQMIS for real-time monitoring, mandates Aadhaar linkage for tap connections, and conducts mandatory Third Party Inspection (TPI) to ensure quality.

Prioritization of JE/AES affected districts is accurate, as is the funding mechanism.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The decentralized approach with VAPs, the role of Paani Samitis with women representation, and their operational responsibilities are accurately depicted.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The monitoring through JJM-WQMIS, Aadhaar linkage, mandatory TPI, and the use of 'Har Ghar Jal' certification for measuring success are all accurate features of JJM implementation.\n\nTherefore, statements 2 and 3 are completely accurate, making (b) the correct option.

While Oman, like many countries, faces challenges related to its demographics, the statement misrepresents the demographic dividend as a *challenge*.  The demographic dividend refers to the potential economic growth that can occur when a large portion of the population is of working age.  Oman's relatively young population presents an *opportunity* for a demographic dividend, not a challenge.  Challenges might include creating enough jobs for this growing workforce or providing adequate education and training.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While Oman does export limestone, it is inaccurate to state that limestone exports surpass oil revenue.  Oman's economy remains significantly reliant on oil and gas revenues, although it is diversifying its economy.  Limestone is a relatively minor export compared to the nation's hydrocarbon sector.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is partially correct. While Hawking radiation does involve particles escaping the black hole's event horizon, the exact composition is still a subject of ongoing research and theoretical debate.  It's theorized to consist of pairs of particles and antiparticles created near the event horizon, with one escaping and the other falling into the black hole. Photons and neutrinos are among the particles expected, but not exclusively.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Stephen Hawking proposed the theory of Hawking radiation in 1974, revolutionizing our understanding of black holes. His work suggested that black holes are not perfectly black but emit a faint thermal radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation, although extremely weak, gradually causes black holes to lose mass and eventually evaporate.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Despite decades of research, direct observational evidence of Hawking radiation remains elusive. The radiation is incredibly faint and difficult to detect against the background radiation of the universe.  Current technology is not advanced enough to provide definitive experimental confirmation.  The detection would require extremely sensitive instruments capable of distinguishing the extremely low-energy radiation predicted by the theory from other sources of background noise.  Future advancements in technology might allow for such detection.  Therefore, the statement is currently false.\n"

The L1 point's location minimizes the obstructions caused by Earth.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The L1 Lagrange point is a point of gravitational equilibrium between the Sun and Earth.  The combined gravitational pull of these two celestial bodies balances the centrifugal force experienced by an object at that point, allowing a spacecraft to remain relatively stable without requiring continuous orbital adjustments. This stability significantly reduces fuel consumption for maintaining position.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the gravitational forces are balanced at L1, they are not negligible.  Spacecraft still experience some gravitational influence from the Sun and Earth, and other gravitational perturbations from planets, requiring occasional course corrections and fuel expenditure for maintaining a stable halo orbit around the L1 point.  The fuel requirements are significantly less than at other orbital locations, but not entirely eliminated.\n"

Oversimplifying the disease's etiology to just amyloid plaques is a misleading simplification.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. MRI scans are valuable tools in assessing brain structure and detecting potential signs of Alzheimer's such as atrophy, but they do not definitively diagnose the disease.  A definitive diagnosis often requires a combination of clinical evaluation, cognitive testing, and sometimes even cerebrospinal fluid analysis to identify specific biomarkers.

The rules mandate electronic registration for specified animals, along with timeframes for reporting births and transfers. This tests factual recall of the specific timelines mentioned in the rules.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The application for transferring captive elephants is to be made to the Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), not the Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW).

The target was to reduce malaria incidence and mortality rates by a certain percentage. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the successor to the MDGs, also maintain a similar focus on reduction rather than eradication.\n\n2. **Incorrect:** The RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) malaria vaccine is a significant development, but it's not on the WHO's essential medicines list in the same way that other widely used and readily available drugs are.

While India has historically provided refuge to many, its approach is largely ad hoc and based on humanitarian considerations rather than a codified legal framework.  Statement 1 is incorrect because a formal national refugee policy is absent.  India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. Its approach to refugees is based on bilateral agreements and humanitarian considerations. Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNHCR's operational authority within India is limited; its role is primarily advisory and dependent on the Indian government's willingness to cooperate. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, none of the statements accurately describe India's current position on refugee policy.

The mountains intercept the moisture-laden monsoon winds, forcing them to rise and cool, leading to heavy precipitation. The rain shadow effect on the eastern side results in relatively drier conditions compared to the western slopes.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Anamudi, the highest peak in the Western Ghats, is situated in the state of Kerala, not Tamil Nadu.  Tamil Nadu experiences the rain shadow effect of the Western Ghats, leading to lower rainfall in the eastern parts of the state.\n"

The GST regime in India employs a four-slab tax structure (5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%) to accommodate the varying taxability of essential goods and luxury items. A cess is levied on top of the 28% slab for certain goods.\n2.  The introduction of different GST tax slabs was primarily driven by the need to standardize tax rates across all goods and services, irrespective of their nature or usage.  A uniform 18% rate was initially proposed.\n3.  The cess levied under the GST system is a state-level tax, primarily intended to fund specific state-level infrastructure projects.  The Centre collects it directly.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n",
        "option_a": "1 only\n",
        "option_b": "2 only\n",
        "option_c": "1 and 3 only\n",
        "option_d": "2 and 3 only\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately reflects the GST structure in India.  The tiered system of tax slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%) aims to differentiate between essential goods and luxury or demerit goods, applying higher tax rates to the latter. The additional cess on the highest slab further targets luxury, sin, and demerit goods, generating revenue for specific purposes.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The rationale behind the different tax slabs was precisely the *opposite* of standardization.  The different rates were deliberately introduced to avoid taxing essential goods at the same rate as luxury items, acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of the market and the need for social equity in taxation. A uniform rate was indeed initially proposed but was not implemented due to this concern.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The cess levied under GST is a *central* levy, although the revenue generated may be utilized for state-level compensation or specific projects (as decided by the Centre). It is not solely a state-level tax. The Centre is responsible for its imposition and collection.  This is a crucial difference that highlights the federal structure of the Indian tax system where both Centre and States play a role in taxation. The statement incorrectly assigns the cess entirely to the states and their infrastructure projects.\n"

The statement is slightly misleading by stating that Venture Capital Funds are not under SEBI regulation.  In fact, they are.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.

Furthermore, SEBI's involvement in the inclusion of Indian green bonds in global indices is indeed relevant to its role in promoting the Indian financial market globally.\n\nStatement 3 is largely correct. SEBI's role in designating systemically important FMIs and regulating stock exchanges is fundamental to maintaining the stability and integrity of the Indian financial system.

The RBI does *not* maintain a fixed percentage for PSL over time; it periodically reviews and updates the allocation based on evolving economic needs and policy objectives.  While the listed sectors are indeed included, the assertion of a fixed, unchanging percentage is false.\n\nStatement 2 accurately describes the core objective of PSL. It\u2019s designed to direct credit towards sectors that might otherwise struggle to access sufficient funds, fostering inclusive growth and addressing regional imbalances.  The periodic updating of eligible sectors and loan limits is also a key aspect of the policy's flexibility. The statement is slightly misleading by stating that MFIs are not included;  they are included in the PSL guidelines.\n\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The statement correctly lists many of the eligible sectors, but it contradicts the reality of the RBI's periodic review and updates to the list of eligible sectors and loan limits.

Popular algorithms include Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Blockchain's decentralized and transparent nature is a key advantage, allowing for public auditability of transactions.  However, this transparency also raises concerns about data privacy, as sensitive information could be potentially exposed.  Furthermore, while blockchain technology is generally considered secure, it's not immune to security vulnerabilities, and attacks targeting specific network weaknesses have been observed.\n"

The establishment of major Buddhist monastic universities like Nalanda (Bihar) and Vikramshila (Bihar) played a pivotal role in the preservation and dissemination of Buddhist knowledge and texts across South and Central Asia.  These centres served as crucial hubs for learning and scholarship, attracting students and scholars from far-flung regions.  The geographical spread of these institutions is a key factor in understanding the reach of Buddhism.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was indeed a key figure in the Aligarh Movement and founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. However, he did *not* advocate for complete independence from British rule; instead, he adopted a more conciliatory approach, aiming to secure better opportunities for Muslims within the British system.  His stance on the Indian National Congress was one of opposition.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Rampa Rebellion, led by Alluri Sitarama Raju, was a direct consequence of the British government's policies. The Madras Forest Act of 1882 severely restricted the tribal communities' access to forest resources and their traditional Podu cultivation practices, leading to widespread resentment and ultimately to the rebellion.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is partially correct. The Subarnarekha River does flow through Jharkhand and contributes to the state's resources but the statement that it significantly contributes to irrigation and hydroelectric power generation is an exaggeration. While some irrigation and hydroelectric projects utilize the river's water, its impact in these sectors is not as dominant as other rivers in India.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Jharkhand holds substantial bauxite reserves, a key raw material for aluminum production. These reserves are indeed a crucial factor in the national aluminum industry. However,  the statement's claim of the reserves being primarily located in the northern part is a simplification.  Bauxite deposits are spread across several regions within Jharkhand.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Son River, while flowing through parts of Jharkhand, also extends into other states. It is not entirely confined within Jharkhand's borders. Its contribution to the state's topography, though significant, is not exclusive.\n\n"

However,  the claim that each location is situated on the banks of a *single* sacred river is not entirely accurate. Prayagraj, for instance, is at the confluence of three rivers (Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati).  The frequency of 12 years is also correct for the *Maha Kumbh Mela*.  The Ardh Kumbh Mela is held every six years.\n\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The central ritualistic practice of the Kumbh Mela involves bathing in sacred rivers.  The belief in the purifying and spiritually liberating power of these waters is fundamental to the Mela's religious significance.  It is indeed predominantly a Hindu religious event.\n\nStatement 3 is partially correct. UNESCO has indeed recognized the Kumbh Mela as an Intangible Cultural Heritage.

The rejection of the caste system is a fundamental aspect of their socio-religious identity.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Basavanna, a 12th-century social reformer and philosopher, is widely recognized as the founder of the Lingayat movement (also known as Virashaivism). His teachings emphasized social equality, devotion to Shiva, and the rejection of caste distinctions, forming the core tenets of the Lingayat faith.  His influence on the development of the Lingayat movement is undeniable and well-established in historical accounts.\n"

Rabi crops, on the other hand, are sown in winter and harvested in the spring. The specific climatic conditions required for jute, including high humidity and rainfall, are characteristic of the Kharif season.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Jute thrives in hot and humid climatic conditions with abundant rainfall.  These conditions are necessary for its growth and development.  The crop requires significant moisture throughout its growing period.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While India is a major exporter of raw jute, its overall dominance in the global jute market is also significantly due to its substantial exports of jute goods.  India possesses a significant jute manufacturing industry that processes raw jute into a wide range of products, which are then exported internationally.  Both raw jute and jute goods contribute to India's global market position.\n"

They are characterized by their inability to generate sufficient revenue to cover their operating costs and debt obligations.  Their continued existence despite this financial distress is the defining feature of a \"zombie\" entity.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Zombie startups often survive because they manage to secure continued funding, either through further investment rounds or by delaying debt repayments. This external support allows them to continue operations even though they are not commercially sustainable in the long term.  This often happens due to investor reluctance to accept losses or write-offs.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. A \"funding winter\" refers to a period of reduced venture capital investment. While it does increase the risk of startup failure, not all startups close during such a period.  Some startups with strong fundamentals or existing revenue streams may continue to operate, while others may be forced to restructure or close down.  The impact varies depending on each startup's individual financial health and investor support.\n"

The Malegam Committee (2013) and later the Bimal Jalan Committee (2014-15) significantly influenced the RBI's approach to surplus transfer to the government.  Their recommendations led to a revised economic capital framework, resulting in a higher percentage of surplus being transferred. The significant increase in the surplus transfer in 2022-23 (188% jump from 2021-22) reflects this influence.\n\n"

This demonstrates the RBI's broader role in managing government finances and liquidity in the economy.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The RBI regulates commercial banks, NBFCs, and cooperative banks.  The data also shows that the RBI licenses and regulates Payment Banks. This indicates the RBI's extensive regulatory reach in the Indian financial system, encompassing various types of banking institutions.  The statement is therefore factually inaccurate.\n"

RDSS aims to reduce Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% by 2024-25, but excludes private sector DISCOMs from its coverage.\n2.

        "option_b": "2 only\n",

        "option_d": "1, 2, and 3\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The RDSS aims to improve the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of DISCOMs.  The scheme targets a reduction in AT&C losses to 12-15% by 2024-25. However, it specifically excludes private sector DISCOMs. This focus on public sector DISCOMs reflects the government's policy priorities in ensuring reliable and affordable power supply.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The RDSS integrates and replaces earlier schemes like IPDS, DDUGJY, and PMDP-2015, creating a unified approach to distribution sector reform. This consolidation demonstrates the government's effort to streamline and improve the effectiveness of its power sector initiatives.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While RDSS prioritizes smart metering in 500 AMRUT cities with high AT&C losses, all Union Territories, and MSMEs, industrial, and commercial consumers, it *also* includes all government offices at the block level and above. This broad coverage underscores the scheme's goal of achieving universal coverage and improving power supply across all sectors.\n"

        "question_text": "With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**\n\n1. Project Nexus is a multilateral initiative enabling instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic Fast Payments Systems (FPS), including India's UPI, with systems in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand but excluding ASEAN countries.\n2. Project Nexus is primarily driven by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and aims to enhance India's financial technology infrastructure.\n3. Project Nexus is expected to improve cross-border transaction efficiency and promote financial inclusion across participating countries.\n\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n",
        "option_a": "1 only\n",
        "option_b": "3 only\n",
        "option_c": "1 and 3 only\n",
        "option_d": "1, 2, and 3\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is partially correct. Project Nexus does aim to interlink domestic FPS, including India's UPI, with systems in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.  However, the exclusion of ASEAN countries is inaccurate, as Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand are all members of ASEAN.  This shows a misunderstanding of the geographical scope of the project.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI is a crucial participant in Project Nexus,  it is not solely driving the initiative. Project Nexus is a multilateral initiative, meaning it involves multiple countries and international organizations. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is the main initiator.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the project's governance structure.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. A key objective of Project Nexus is to enhance cross-border payment efficiency and promote financial inclusion.  By connecting different national payment systems, the project aims to reduce transaction costs and improve access to financial services for individuals and businesses across participating countries.  This aligns with broader global efforts toward greater financial integration and inclusivity.\n"

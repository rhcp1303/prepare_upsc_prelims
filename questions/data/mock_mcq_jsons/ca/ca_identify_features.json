The Neo-Vaishnavite movement, spearheaded by figures like Sankardeva, significantly impacted Assam's religious and social landscape.  Ojapali, a musical form often accompanying theatrical performances, further enriches the state's cultural identity.  The other options are incorrect; while Manipur, Nagaland, and Mizoram have their distinct cultural traditions, none encompass this particular combination of elements.\n"

The Brahmaputra River valley is a defining geographical characteristic of Assam, shaping its landscape and influencing its economy and culture. The Dhansiri River indeed forms a part of Assam's boundary, playing a role in its geographical delineation. The semi-evergreen forests of the Eastern Himalayas are a significant part of Assam's biodiversity and ecosystem.  The Barak River basin, while partly touching Assam, is not primarily associated with it in the way the other features are. Assam is also the oldest oil-producing state in India, with its oilfields shaping its industrial landscape. Therefore, four out of the five features are directly associated with Assam, making (d) the correct answer.  The inclusion of the Barak River basin as a distractor makes the question challenging, as it shares some overlapping characteristics with Assam's geography.\n"

The Code might have procedural provisions related to the enforcement of such awards once they are passed under the Arbitration Act, but it does not establish those mechanisms.

The GST structure in India comprises four tax slabs: 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.\n2.  Differentiated tax slabs were implemented to ensure that essential goods are taxed at a lower rate than luxury items.\n3.  A cess is levied on the highest tax slab (28%) to fund specific government programs.\n4.  The cess levied under GST is collected by the Central Government and is not shared with the states.\n5.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 5 accurately reflect the GST structure in India.  The GST Council, which comprises representatives from both the Centre and the States, sets the tax slabs.  The tiered structure ensures that essential goods face lower tax burdens compared to luxury or non-essential items. The 28% slab specifically targets luxury, sin, and demerit goods.  A cess is levied on top of the 28% tax on these goods to fund programs such as the Swachh Bharat Cess,  though the specific use of cess revenue can change.  However, Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the Central Government collects the cess, a portion is distributed to the states according to the GST compensation mechanism. This distribution is a crucial aspect of the GST's fiscal federalism component. Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading.  It doesn't explicitly state the method of distribution and the programs funded, which can vary.\n"

Coffee production is indeed associated with the Western Ghats, but it's primarily concentrated on the windward slopes, not the leeward slopes, due to the higher rainfall and suitable climate. Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the Western Ghats are characterized by rocky terrain in many areas, extensive stretches also have diverse soil types and landscapes. Statement 4 is correct. The steep slopes and heavy rainfall in the Western Ghats make it highly susceptible to landslides, a major environmental hazard. Statement 5 is incorrect. While sub-tropical Moist Pine forests are present in the Western Ghats, they are not extensively found throughout the entire range; they are found at specific altitudes and locations.  Therefore, only three features (1, 4, and partially 2) are correctly associated.\n"

Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complex relationship between socialism and industrialization.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.

His socialist ideology was more aligned with anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist struggles rather than a comprehensive socialist economic program.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru (2) was a key figure in shaping India's secular and socialist policies.  His vision for India explicitly incorporated secularism as a fundamental principle and advocated for a mixed economy with socialist influences, aiming for social justice and equitable development.  His socialist leanings are evident in his policies on land reforms and the creation of public sector enterprises.\n\nM.N. Roy (3), while a significant figure in the early Indian communist movement and an advocate of socialism, his views on secularism were not as consistently emphasized as those of Nehru or even Bose.  His socialist ideology was influenced by Marxist thought, but his later years saw a shift towards a more individualistic philosophy.\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose (4) advocated for both secularism and socialism, though his socialist views evolved over time.

The fort's strong fortifications, including its strategic placement and complex defensive structure, made it a nearly impregnable stronghold.  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's coronation at Raigad further elevated its importance in Maratha history.  While the fort had a coastal aspect and was involved in regional trade, these weren't the primary reasons for its \"Gibraltar of the East\" moniker.  The architectural style comparison to Gibraltar is largely inaccurate. Therefore, option (b) correctly identifies the key features, namely its robust fortifications and its connection to Shivaji Maharaj's reign.

Paragraph 15 of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, explicitly grants the Election Commission the authority to adjudicate disputes arising from mergers or splits within recognized political parties.  The Supreme Court's upholding of this provision in *Sadiq Ali v. ECI* further solidifies its legal standing.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The 1968 Order is the foundational legislation that empowers the ECI to recognize political parties, a crucial step in enabling their participation in the electoral process.  This recognition grants parties access to electoral symbols and other privileges.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The Representation of the People Act, 1951, primarily focuses on the qualifications and disqualifications of *candidates*, not voters.  The qualifications and registration of voters are mainly governed by the Representation of the People Act, 1950.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. Article 324 of the Constitution of India establishes the Election Commission of India and outlines its powers and functions related to the conduct of elections.  This constitutional basis underpins the ECI's authority.\n\nTherefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) are accurate.\n"

The Baltic Sea's brackish nature is primarily due to a limited inflow of saltwater from the North Sea and a significant influx of freshwater from numerous rivers.\n2.  The Baltic Sea experiences a unique circulation pattern, characterized by a stratified water column with relatively stagnant deeper layers, contributing to oxygen deficiency in some areas.\n3.  The Baltic Sea is home to a diverse range of marine life, including several commercially important fish species, despite its low salinity.\n4.

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Baltic Sea's salinity is significantly lower than that of typical ocean water because the inflow of saline water from the North Sea through narrow straits is restricted. This limited exchange, coupled with the substantial input of freshwater from rivers like the Vistula and Oder, results in the brackish conditions.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Baltic Sea exhibits a unique hydrological characteristic. Its relatively shallow depth and restricted connection to the open ocean lead to a strong halocline (a layer of rapid salinity change) and stratification. The deeper layers are poorly mixed and often become anoxic (lacking oxygen) due to decomposition of organic matter. This phenomenon significantly influences the sea's ecosystem and biodiversity.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Despite its low salinity, the Baltic Sea supports a surprisingly rich ecosystem.  While the species diversity might be lower than in fully saline seas, several commercially important fish species, adapted to brackish water conditions, thrive within its waters.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Volga-Baltic Waterway connects the Baltic Sea to the Volga River, which in turn flows into the Caspian Sea.  However, it does *not* directly connect the Baltic Sea to the Caspian Sea;  there's an intermediary river system involved. This is a crucial distinction that tests the candidate's precise understanding of the waterway's geographical context.\n"

The increase was primarily focused on industries that directly supported the war effort.  The textile sector saw some expansion but not as a direct consequence of the war effort itself.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The war significantly strained British resources and authority, creating opportunities for the Indian independence movement. The war-related hardships and the increased awareness of global power dynamics fueled nationalist sentiment and resistance against British rule.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  India's involvement in World War II was far from unanimous.  While the British government compelled India's participation, significant opposition existed within the Indian National Congress and other political parties. Figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Acharya Narendra Dev, Jayaprakash Narayan, and Subhas Chandra Bose actively opposed India's involvement or pursued alternative strategies.\n\nStatement 4 is correct. The Defence of India ordinance, enacted during the war, granted the government extensive powers, curtailing civil liberties and suppressing dissent.

Statement 3 is also correct; the Siang River's course includes Arunachal Pradesh before reaching Assam. Statement 4 is partially correct; the Lohit and Dibang are tributaries of the Brahmaputra, but the question misleads by not specifically mentioning the Siang River's role in the system.

The Western Ghats are characterized by a steep gradient, leading to rapid river flow and the formation of waterfalls and gorges.  The rapid flow is a direct consequence of the steep gradient.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Western Ghats are predominantly known for their high rainfall and support of diverse forest types including tropical rainforests and sub-tropical moist pine forests, Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests are also found in parts of the region, particularly in the rain-shadow areas.  This fact is designed as a potential distractor given the emphasis on high rainfall in typical descriptions of the Western Ghats.\n\nStatement 4 is partially correct. The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats do converge, but the Palghat Gap is a significant break in the Western Ghats, not a point of convergence with the Eastern Ghats. The Palghat Gap is a low-lying area that allows for easier east-west movement across the mountain range. The convergence is a more gradual process occurring over a much broader geographical area.  This makes it a strong distractor.\n\n"

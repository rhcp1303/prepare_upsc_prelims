        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nAhilyabai Holkar's reign is characterized by significant contributions to both the economic and cultural landscape of Malwa and beyond. While she operated within the broader context of the Maratha Empire, she was an effective and independent ruler, known for her administrative skills and patronage of arts and culture.  Her refurbishment of numerous jyotirlingas and temples demonstrates her cultural impact, while her promotion of trade and economic activities in Maheshwar, including the textile industry, showcases her economic contribution.  Option (a) is incorrect because while she may have had conflicts, her primary focus wasn't opposition to the Maratha Empire. Option (b) misrepresents her legacy, which was primarily defined by her administrative and cultural achievements rather than military actions. Option (d) is too narrow, neglecting her substantial contributions to her region. Her family connections are important context, but not her defining characteristic.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  The NOTA (None Of The Above) option, introduced in 2013, provides a mechanism for voters to formally register their disapproval of all candidates contesting in an election. This reflects a growing awareness of voter agency and the importance of providing avenues for expressing dissent within the electoral framework.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. In the event that NOTA secures the highest number of votes in a constituency, the candidate with the second-highest number of votes is declared the winner.  This provision is designed to ensure that a seat is not left vacant due to widespread voter dissatisfaction.  While it might seem counterintuitive, it prevents a situation where a lack of positive support for any candidate results in a vacant seat.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The FPTP (First Past the Post) system, while widely used in India, does *not* require a candidate to secure an absolute majority (more than 50% of the votes) to win.  A candidate simply needs to obtain more votes than any other contender in the constituency to be declared the winner. This system can sometimes lead to situations where the winning candidate has received a relatively small percentage of the total votes cast, but still wins the seat.\n"

The Speaker's term is linked to the life of the House (Lok Sabha).  The term ends with the dissolution of the House, unless the Speaker resigns or is removed from office earlier. The Prime Minister's resignation does not automatically trigger the end of the Speaker's term.\n\nOption (c) is correct.  Article 94 of the Constitution stipulates that a motion of no-confidence against the Speaker can be moved with a 14-day notice.  This provision ensures that there is sufficient time for deliberation and debate before a vote is taken on the motion.  This period allows the Speaker to respond to the allegations and for members to consider the matter thoroughly.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect. The Speaker's salary, unlike that of other MPs, is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India.

The SDRF is a joint fund, with states contributing a percentage to it.  States contribute 25% of the SDRF funds, while special category states contribute a reduced amount of 10%. This reflects the recognition that special category states often face greater challenges and may require greater central assistance.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The funds allocated to both the NDRF and SDRF are specifically earmarked for disaster response and management.  They cannot be diverted for other purposes.

Options (a), (b), and (d) present oversimplified or misleading perspectives, focusing on only one aspect of the HKH region's multifaceted significance and neglecting its crucial ecological role.  (a) understates the broader importance, (b) downplays the ecological significance, and (d) overemphasizes the military aspect.\n"

Kandla Port is a major deep-draft port in Gujarat, designed to handle significant cargo volume year-round (\"all-weather\"). It's a relatively new development (\"greenfield\"),  and its strategic location facilitates trade connections between India, the Middle East, and Europe. Nhava Sheva (a), V.O.

The regulations acknowledge that complete elimination of trace methanol is practically impossible and impractical.  They instead focus on setting maximum permissible limits to prevent methanol poisoning caused by higher concentrations. Option (a) is incorrect as it misrepresents the regulatory stance; a complete ban is not in place. Option (c) is incorrect because the FDA is a US agency; Indian regulations govern methanol in India. Option (d) is incorrect because permissible levels are not solely dependent on quantity produced; other factors like the fermentation process and the type of beverage are considered.  This nuanced understanding of regulatory frameworks is crucial for UPSC-level questions.\n"

Option (a) describes Dravidian architecture more accurately, while (d) is not representative of Hampi's grandeur. Option (b) is incorrect as the Vijayanagara Empire predates significant Mughal architectural influence in South India. The fusion of religious and secular structures in Hampi showcases a complex urban design reflecting the empire's power and cultural sophistication.

The Finance Ministry's role is primarily policy-making and ownership, while Sponsor Banks are shareholders.  Therefore, the RBI's comprehensive regulatory framework makes it the most appropriate answer.  Option (a) is incorrect because NABARD's role is primarily supervisory and not regulatory. Option (c) is incorrect as the Finance Ministry sets policies but doesn't directly regulate day-to-day operations.

This scheme provides sophisticated weapons to VDGs, headed by retired officers from the Army, CPMF, or J&K Police.  The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, a modified scheme extending until 2028-29, aims to boost advanced biofuel projects using agricultural residues, industrial waste, and other renewable feedstocks.  The Maharashtra government's 'Ladki Bahin Yojana' provides financial assistance to women aged 21-65 with family incomes below \u20b92.5 lakh. Project PARI, launched by the Ministry of Culture, aims to enhance the public art scene by blending India's cultural heritage with contemporary themes.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) involve shared funding between the Centre and States, formulated on subjects from the State List. Odisha recently implemented a one-day menstrual leave policy for working women.  The RISE Accelerator program supports Indian and Australian businesses expanding into each other's markets. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranks higher education institutions based on teaching, learning, research, graduation outcomes, outreach, and perception.  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY-U) aims to construct 1 crore houses for EWS, LIG, and MIG families without existing pucca houses.

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, although impacting rural areas indirectly, is predominantly an urban housing scheme.\n\nOption (c) is partially correct as Mission Karmayogi and the Jiyo Parsi Scheme relate to social welfare. However, the inclusion of Odisha's menstrual leave policy creates a mismatch. While progressive, it\u2019s a state-level policy, unlike the other two, which are national initiatives with broader implications for social welfare.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because CSSs inherently involve shared funding between the Centre and States, not complete central control.

Option (a) is incorrect because the RBI's role is primarily financial, not operational in agricultural production and distribution. Option (b) is incorrect as the RBI plays a crucial role in agricultural credit and finance. Option (d), while partly true, understates the RBI's direct involvement through specialized schemes and lending institutions focused on the agricultural sector.

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nOption (c) is incorrect because while SEBI does regulate Credit Rating Agencies, it also has regulatory oversight over Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulator of RRBs, but SEBI's role in the broader financial ecosystem means there's some overlap in regulatory responsibilities, particularly concerning aspects of financial instruments and transactions involving RRBs.  SEBI's mandate is to protect investor interests and maintain the integrity of the securities market, which includes interactions with RRBs even if the RBI is the primary regulator. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all accurate representations of SEBI's activities and responsibilities.  SEBI's designation of Domestically Systemically Important FMIs is crucial for maintaining financial stability.  Its role in facilitating the inclusion of Indian green bonds in global indices reflects its commitment to sustainable finance.

The multi-slab structure directly addresses the challenges posed by a heterogeneous market, aiming for efficiency and equity.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Gupta period (c. 320\u2013550 CE) significantly impacted art and architecture across much of the Indian subcontinent. While Assam maintained its unique artistic identity, the Gupta idiom's influence is evident in the assimilation of certain Gupta artistic elements into pre-existing Assamese artistic traditions. This resulted in a hybrid style, a unique blend of Gupta elegance and local aesthetics. The influence was not a total replacement (a) nor a negligible one (b). Although religious architecture may have been a prominent area of influence, it's not the only art form affected (d).  The fusion of styles demonstrates the complex interplay between cultural exchange and the preservation of regional artistic identities in India's history.\n"

The Ministry of Finance has a broader remit and doesn't directly regulate Nidhi companies. SEBI's focus is on securities markets, while the Department of Economic Affairs deals with broader economic policy.  Therefore, only the MCA accurately reflects the described role.

The Ministry of Finance's role is primarily financial regulation and investment, while direct regulation of fintech operations is not its primary responsibility. Therefore, the correct answer focuses on the DPIIT's specific function of registering fintech startups, not merely regulating them or focusing on investments.

The Act mandates a specific representation criterion aiming for diversity and inclusivity in its composition, with half the members being judicial and half from diverse social groups (SCs/STs/OBCs, minorities, and women). Options (a) and (d) are incorrect as the Lokpal is not above the Supreme Court and its decisions are subject to judicial review. Option (b) is incorrect since the Lokpal's jurisdiction extends to both central and state officials, though there are separate Lokayuktas at the state level.

While they describe valid nitrogen cycle processes, they are not the primary focus of the question's description.  Denitrification (a) is the reduction of nitrates, not oxidation. Ammonification (b) produces ammonia, not consuming it. Nitrogen fixation (d) is a different process altogether, converting atmospheric nitrogen directly into ammonia, typically through symbiotic bacteria or industrial processes.

Option (c) misidentifies the god honored; the games were held in honor of Zeus. Option (d) is incorrect as the revival of the Olympic Games was a modern initiative, unrelated to the Roman Empire. The question tests factual recall regarding the origins and revival of the Olympic Games, requiring knowledge beyond commonly known facts.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe ISA's operational strategy is not limited to a single approach.  Option (a) is incorrect because while the ISA does facilitate project financing, direct financial aid is not its primary mechanism.  It leverages its Global Solar Facility (GSF) and works to attract private capital. Option (b) is incorrect as the ISA's role is broader than just research. It focuses on the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement through the massive deployment of solar energy. Option (d) is also incorrect; the ISA works in partnership with organizations like the IEA and IRENA, but it doesn't solely rely on their actions.  The correct answer, (c), accurately portrays the ISA's holistic approach: combining collaboration (among member countries and partner organizations), knowledge sharing (technical expertise and best practices), and facilitating project financing (through the GSF and private capital attraction) to achieve its renewable energy goals. This multi-pronged strategy is key to its effectiveness in achieving large-scale solar energy deployment.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nOption (c) is the most accurate statement.  Uttar Pradesh's extensive alluvial deposits, formed by the deposition of fertile silt from the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, have historically contributed to its exceptionally fertile land. This rich agricultural potential has supported high agricultural productivity and consequently, a high population density throughout its history. Despite this inherent advantage, Uttar Pradesh has experienced developmental lags compared to other states, highlighting the complex interplay between resource availability and socio-economic development.\n\n\nOptions (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  While Uttar Pradesh does have rock paintings, they are not primarily focused on the Mauryan Empire.  (a) is a misconception. Option (b) incorrectly links methane emissions solely to traditional irrigation, ignoring other contributing factors like rice cultivation and livestock farming. Option (d) is inaccurate as Uttar Pradesh's net out-migration is a long-standing trend, not solely a recent phenomenon, and involves factors beyond mere economic downturns.  The out-migration is a complex issue influenced by factors like limited employment opportunities in agriculture and the pull of urban centers in other states.\n"

Initially, he engaged in military conflicts with Rajput states, demonstrating Mughal military strength. However, he understood the strategic importance of their loyalty and military prowess.  He skillfully employed a policy of matrimonial alliances, integrating prominent Rajput families into the Mughal ruling class through marriages to his family members and granting them significant positions within the administration and the army.

The British government, facing immense pressure due to the war, attempted to appease Indian nationalists to a certain degree.\n*  The war effort led to increased economic hardship in India, exacerbating existing social and political tensions. This led to a surge in nationalist sentiment and organized resistance against colonial rule.\n*  The war also affected India's external relations, particularly with Japan, which sought to exploit the situation for its own interests.\n\nWhich of the following statements BEST reflects the complex interplay of these factors?\n",

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (c) because World War II's impact on India was primarily characterized by the intensification of existing socio-economic disparities.  The war effort placed immense strain on India's resources, leading to widespread shortages of food, essential goods, and inflation. This disproportionately affected the poor and marginalized, further fueling resentment against the British Raj. While the British did attempt some appeasement measures, these were insufficient to quell the growing nationalist movement, which was already gaining momentum before the war. Option (a) is incorrect because the war did not lead to a unified political front.  The Congress and other nationalist groups still had internal divisions and differing strategies. Option (b) is incorrect as the war effort, along with its economic hardships, actually *increased* nationalist sentiment. Option (d) is completely wrong; the war played a pivotal role in accelerating the Indian independence movement.\n"

China's support for Pakistan, a long-standing rival of India, and its territorial claims in areas like Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh directly challenge India's security interests and territorial integrity. These actions are a major source of friction, overriding other factors.

        "explanation": " The Santhal Uprising was primarily caused by the socio-economic consequences of the Permanent Settlement Act of 1793.  This act, while intended to consolidate British revenue, led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a few zamindars, displacing and impoverishing many Santhal farmers.  The resulting land pressure, coupled with exploitative practices, fueled widespread discontent and ultimately led to the rebellion. Option (a) is incorrect; the uprising wasn't a response to technological advancements. Option (c) is a distractor; while natural disasters might exacerbate existing tensions, they were not the primary cause. Option (d) is also incorrect; while nationalist sentiments played a role in later uprisings, the Santhal Uprising was primarily a socio-economic rebellion against immediate grievances.  Understanding the socio-economic context of 19th-century India is crucial for comprehending the causes of this rebellion. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to understand the root causes of the Santhal Uprising.\n"

While both the President (Article 123) and Governor (Article 213) have the power to promulgate ordinances during the recess of their respective legislative bodies, the Governor's power is subject to significant limitations regarding the President's role.  Specifically, the Governor *cannot* issue an ordinance on any matter where a similar bill would have required the President's prior sanction for introduction in the State Legislative Assembly, or if the Governor would have been constitutionally required to reserve a similar bill for the President's consideration, or if a similar state legislative act would have been invalid without presidential assent.

This means that the ITAT's decisions are no longer final in such cases; both the revenue authorities and taxpayers can appeal to the High Court.

India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, and while the balance of trade often favors India, the volume of trade itself is substantial and constantly evolving.  The focus on India exporting capital goods is a simplification, but accurately reflects a major component of this trade.  India's investments in Bangladesh's infrastructure and its export of various goods and services contribute significantly to Bangladesh's economic growth and development.\n\n\nOptions (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.

The Teesta River water sharing remains a contentious issue, with unresolved disputes affecting the bilateral relationship.

The LBA led to the exchange of these enclaves, resulting in a more clearly defined land boundary.

This overlapping claim is the root cause of multiple and persistent territorial disputes in the region, making it a major source of geopolitical tension. Option (a) is incorrect because while the Paracel Islands are a significant part of China's claim within the Nine-dash line, the Nine-dash line itself is the broader, more encompassing, and legally contested assertion. Option (c) is similarly incorrect; the Spratly Islands are another area of contention within the Nine-dash line, but the line's overall expansive nature is the key characteristic. Option (d) is incorrect as the Taiwan Strait, while geographically related, is a separate issue concerning the political status of Taiwan and not directly a part of the Nine-dash line's territorial claim.

Option (d) is incorrect; while Karnataka receives rainfall, its rainfall pattern is not primarily dictated by cyclonic activity linked to the Western Ghats. Cyclones are a separate meteorological phenomenon. The question tests factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding of orographic rainfall and rain-shadow effects.\n"

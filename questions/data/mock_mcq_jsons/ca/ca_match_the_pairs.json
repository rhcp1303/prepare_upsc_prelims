Ahilyabai Holkar, a significant 18th-century Maratha ruler, is known for her extensive temple renovations, including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi.  Option (b) is incorrect because while Maheshwar was Ahilyabai's capital, it wasn't the capital of the entire Maratha Empire.  The Maratha Empire had a shifting capital system, with various cities holding prominence at different times. Option (c) is incorrect as Tukoji Rao Holkar succeeded Ahilyabai; he wasn't her contemporary ruler of Malwa. Option (d) is incorrect because Malhar Rao Holkar, Ahilyabai's father-in-law, was instrumental in establishing the Holkar dynasty's power but not its formal founding.  The establishment of a dynasty is a gradual process involving multiple generations and events.\n"

Aarogya Setu was used for contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic; COWIN facilitated COVID-19 vaccine registration; BHIM is a digital payments app; and UMANG provides access to various government services. The pairing of eSakshya App with Blue Economy initiatives is incorrect; eSakshya is related to skill development for women in rural areas.  Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing for UMANG. Option (c) is incorrect because only one pair is accurately matched and Option (d) is incorrect because several pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various mobile applications used in India and their functions. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect information regarding the purpose of eSakshya makes this question challenging.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a crucial role in mobilizing support and coordinating activities during the Quit India Movement across various regions.\n\nOption (a) is incorrect because while the Quit India Movement is correctly linked to Gandhi and Bose, the Kakori Train Action (1925) predates Gandhi's involvement in mass movements at a national level and was orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Mahatma Gandhi with the Kakori Train Action.  The Kakori Train robbery was a significant event in the early stages of the Indian independence movement, but it wasn't directly connected to Gandhi's leadership or strategy.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes Alluri Sitarama Raju with the Non-Cooperation Movement. While Alluri Sitarama Raju was influenced by Gandhi's ideals, his major contribution, the Rampa Rebellion, occurred later and was distinctly a regional, albeit significant, armed rebellion.

The Ministry of Jal Shakti plays a crucial role in river management, including aspects of the National River Conservation Plan, but the development of URMPs is a collaborative effort involving multiple agencies, including NIUA and NMCG, not solely the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  Finally, the DPIIT is not involved in the direct management of the River Ganga; this falls under the purview of the Ministry of Jal Shakti and related organizations like NMCG.  Pair 5 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.\n"

The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides the legal framework for managing activities on the high seas. The Vienna Convention provides a framework for international cooperation on the protection of the ozone layer, but the phase-down of HFCs is a key provision of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, not the Vienna Convention itself. The Kigali Amendment is part of the Montreal Protocol, and its purpose is to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), not directly to protect the ozone layer (though it contributes to it). Option (a) correctly identifies the matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies reflecting potential misconceptions about the specific provisions and focuses of these international agreements.

While Bhagat Singh's ideology was complex and encompassed various aspects, his advocacy for secularism is well-documented through his writings and activism against religious discrimination and communalism.  However, his alignment with socialism is less direct compared to Nehru and Bose.

However, options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies. K.M.

        "explanation": "\n\nAmmonia can contaminate drinking water sources through various pathways, including agricultural runoff and sewage discharge. Sewage water naturally contains ammonia as a byproduct of organic matter decomposition.  Agricultural runoff carries ammonia from fertilizers and animal waste, polluting water bodies.  Composting processes result in ammonia release from the decomposition of organic materials.  Ammonia plays a crucial role as a nutrient in marine ecosystems, supporting phytoplankton growth and the food web.  Therefore, all five pairs correctly link ammonia's presence or origin to specific water bodies or locations.  Any option that does not include all five pairs would be inaccurate.\n"

The partnership between IEA and OECD aligns with their shared goals of energy security and sustainable development. While IRENA works with numerous organizations, including UN bodies, a direct, prominent partnership with UNDP isn't as consistently highlighted as the ISA-World Bank or IEA-OECD relationships. Therefore, option (b) is correct, accurately reflecting the established partnerships between ISA and the World Bank and IEA and the OECD.

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nOnly pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The TRIPS Agreement, while broad, does encompass certain aspects of publicity rights for performers and phonogram producers.  The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) directly protects the rights of performers and phonogram producers, particularly in the digital environment, including broadcasting rights. However, the Rome Convention primarily focuses on performers' rights, phonogram producers' rights and broadcasting rights, not specifically IPR protection; IPR is covered more extensively under TRIPS. The Paris Convention is also primarily concerned with industrial property rights, not performers' rights in the digital environment. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of international legal instruments and their specific areas of coverage.  This question assesses understanding of international conventions related to intellectual property and personality rights, requiring a detailed knowledge of their specific provisions.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nAll four pairs are correctly matched. The *Selvi* case significantly impacted the admissibility of narco-analysis, brain mapping, and polygraph test results as primary evidence in court, emphasizing the right against self-incrimination. The *Puttaswamy* judgment established the right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21.  The *Maru Ram* case clarified the President's pardoning power, establishing that the President doesn't act independently but on the advice of the central government.  Finally, the *SR Bommai* case affirmed the Supreme Court's power to judicially review the President's actions during a state emergency.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they fail to include all the correctly matched pairs.

The Declaration on a Global Climate Finance Framework is a relevant area of concern for the WHO, as climate change exacerbates existing health problems and creates new ones. The WHO's involvement reflects its commitment to addressing the broader determinants of health, including environmental factors.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.\n\nPair 2 is incorrect. While the WHO defines Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards for pharmaceutical products, these standards are primarily developed and managed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), a joint body of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the WHO. The CAC is the primary authority for setting international food standards, including GMP.  The WHO collaborates with the CAC, but the CAC is the lead organization in this context.\n\nPair 3 is incorrect. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the leading international organization addressing global health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it does not solely manage or \"own\" the response. The COVID-19 pandemic response involved a multitude of organizations, governments, and individuals working collaboratively at national, regional, and global levels.

Based on this data, India has been identified as accounting for a substantial portion (half) of malaria cases within the WHO South-East Asia Region in a given year.\n\nPair 1 is incorrect. While some countries have achieved zero malaria deaths, the statement is not true for Jordan.  The WHO's data on malaria mortality varies by country and year, and it's crucial to consult the latest reports for accurate information.

The themes and techniques show clear connections.\n\n3. **Vijayanagara Schools and Phad Paintings:** This pairing is incorrect.  Vijayanagara schools primarily influenced South Indian art styles, while Phad paintings are a distinct Rajasthani tradition with its own unique characteristics. There's no direct stylistic link between the two.\n\n4. **Kalamkari and Mata ni Pachedi:** Kalamkari's distinctive style and techniques, particularly its detailed line work and use of natural dyes, are evident in the Mata ni Pachedi textile art from Gujarat. The influence is clear in the motifs and execution.\n\n\nThis question tests the examinee's analytical skills to identify stylistic influences in Indian art. The inclusion of the Vijayanagara style as a distractor is effective because of its widespread influence across South India, making it plausible for association with various regional styles. The correct answer showcases the nuanced understanding of art history required for success in the UPSC examination.\n"

The question assesses factual recall and the ability to correctly associate art forms with their geographic origins:\n\n1. **Warli Art and Gujarat:** This pairing is incorrect. Warli art is primarily associated with the Warli tribal community in Maharashtra, not Gujarat, although there might be some spillover or influence in neighbouring regions.\n\n2. **Kalamkari and Andhra Pradesh:**  This is a correct pairing. Kalamkari, a type of hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile, has its roots in Andhra Pradesh.\n\n3. **Pattachitra and Odisha:** This is correct. Pattachitra, a traditional scroll painting style, is strongly associated with Odisha.  Raghurajpur is a prominent center for this art form.\n\n4. **Cheriyal Painting and Telangana:** This is correct. Cheriyal painting is a unique scroll painting tradition from Telangana.\n\n\nThe question uses the Warli tribe's location as a major distractor, as it is a well-known tribal art form, but its precise location is often confused. The question successfully differentiates between closely related geographical locations to test the examinee's precise knowledge of Indian art and geography. The correct answer highlights the importance of detailed knowledge of Indian art forms and their geographical distribution.\n"

They depict scenes from his life and legends.\n\n3. **Kerala Murals and Buddhism:** This is incorrect. While some Kerala murals might depict Buddhist figures or narratives, the overwhelming majority are associated with Hindu themes and deities, particularly those related to Vaishnavism and Shaivism.\n\n\nThe question effectively uses the Kerala murals' association with Hinduism as a distractor, making it a challenging yet fair test of knowledge.

Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly links Article 155 with the removal of Governors; Article 155 deals with the *appointment* of Governors, not their removal.  Option (d) is incorrect because it falsely connects Article 155 with the removal of Governors. The removal of a Governor is not explicitly detailed in the constitution but is at the pleasure of the President.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (b) because:\n\n* **Statement 1:** Habitat loss is indeed the most significant threat to the Great Indian Bustard.  This highlights the importance of habitat conservation.\n\n* **Statement 4:** The IUCN does classify the Great Indian Bustard as Critically Endangered (CR), reflecting its extremely high risk of extinction. This demonstrates the severity of the conservation challenge.\n\n* **Statement 5:** The Great Indian Bustard is indeed protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, providing it with the highest level of legal protection in India. This shows the legal framework in place for conservation.\n\n\nStatements 2 and 3 are incorrect:\n\n* **Statement 2:** The Great Indian Bustard is not found only in India; its range extends to a few other countries in the region as well, though its numbers are critically low outside of India. This highlights the need for international collaboration in conservation.\n\n* **Statement 3:** The Great Indian Bustard is not generally considered a migratory bird.  While there might be some local movements, it doesn't undertake large-scale migrations like some other bird species.\n\n\nThis question tests factual recall, analytical abilities, and understanding of conservation challenges.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge of the bird's distribution and migratory behavior. The explanation emphasizes the significance of habitat loss, IUCN classification, and legal protection."

These are accurate reflections of the actions and reports of these committees.\n\n\nOptions (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because UNESCO did not declare Ecologically Sensitive Areas (pair 1 is incorrect).  The High-Level Working Group (HLWG) offered recommendations, but the finalization of ESZ extent is a governmental process, not solely the responsibility of the HLWG (pair 4 is incorrect).  The question tests knowledge of specific environmental committees and their functions.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes it challenging to identify the correctly matched pairs."

        "correct_option": "(d)",
        "explanation": "\n\nOption (d) is correct because statements 4 and 5 accurately reflect facts about the UPSC. The UPSC syllabus indeed defines the exam topics, including subjects like Visual Arts and Environment.  Furthermore, upscstudyhub.com is a publicly available website that serves as a resource for UPSC aspirants, offering study materials and other relevant information.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While the Civil Services Examination is a major component of the UPSC, it is not conducted solely by CSPU. The UPSC itself is the primary conducting body. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Preliminary Examination does not include Indian Art and Culture as a direct, standalone subject in its syllabus. While the subject might be indirectly tested through General Studies, it's not a dedicated component. Statement 3 is partially correct in that the Main Examination assesses answer-writing skills. However,  \"proficient answer writing skills\" is a subjective description rather than a specific, verifiable fact about the examination's structure.  The Main Examination assesses a wide range of skills, and answer writing is one component among many.\n"

The UPSC also provides previous years' question papers as a resource for aspirants, aiding their preparation.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While Ranchi is a potential exam center, it is not a definitive or exclusive location. The UPSC conducts examinations across numerous cities. Statement 4 is incorrect; the UPSC is accountable to the Parliament through the Government of India, not directly to the President. Statement 5 is incorrect. While the UPSC syllabus might touch upon topics related to international organizations like UNESCO, UNESCO itself is not a direct component of the UPSC syllabus.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nOption (c) is the correct answer because statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all factually accurate.  The RBI does regulate commercial banks in India. The Ministry of Education is responsible for the implementation of the NEP 2020.  Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, which defines the UPSC's role and jurisdiction, allowing it to expand or alter the UPSC's powers.  Finally, NPCI is the organization that operates the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).\n\nStatement 1, however, is not entirely accurate. While the UPSC collaborates with state governments on certain recruitments, \"assists in joint recruitment\" is a broad statement. The UPSC's role is primarily in recruiting for All-India Services and Central services, not in directly assisting state-level recruitments in a consistently joint manner.\n"

The RBI regulates NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) as a crucial financial institution within the Indian financial system.  The RBI also acts as a debt manager for state governments, managing their borrowings and debt obligations.  Further, the RBI provides funds to commercial banks through various mechanisms, ensuring liquidity and stability in the banking sector.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI issues currency notes except for the one-rupee note, which is issued by the Ministry of Finance. Statement 4 is incorrect; the RBI implements monetary policy, but it is not directly bound by *all* MPC decisions. While the MPC's recommendations heavily influence RBI's actions, the RBI retains some degree of independent decision-making.\n"

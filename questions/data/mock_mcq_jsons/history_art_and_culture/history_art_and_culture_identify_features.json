The abolition of the Jizya tax, a poll tax on non-Muslims, was a significant step towards religious tolerance, a cornerstone of Akbar's policy of Sulh-i-Kul.  Akbar extensively employed Rajput soldiers, forming strong alliances and integrating them into the Mughal military structure. His patronage extended to various Sufi orders, including the Naqshbandi and Shattari, reflecting his interest in and interaction with diverse religious groups.  However, the Buland Darwaza was constructed by Akbar's predecessor, Emperor Akbar, not Akbar himself. Therefore, only four of the listed elements accurately represent Akbar's reign.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they undercount or overcount the accurate features of Akbar's reign.\n"

Akbar's reputed visit to Amritsar reflects a degree of mutual respect or at least awareness. The execution of Guru Arjun Dev under Jahangir highlights the potential for conflict when religious and political interests clashed. Guru Har Govind's imprisonment and subsequent reconciliation with Jahangir illustrates the fluctuating nature of their relationship.  The hunting incident, the city-building dispute, and the horse seizure, though seemingly minor, reveal the underlying tensions and points of friction that could easily escalate into conflict.  These events demonstrate the evolving dynamic between the Mughal state and the growing Sikh community.\n"

The rise of the Marathas (2) created a major military and political challenge, further destabilizing the empire. The heavy taxation and declining agricultural productivity (3) contributed to widespread peasant unrest and hampered the empire's economic capacity.  Trade and commerce (4) were not absent; in fact, they continued to flourish in many areas, although they were not sufficient to counter the effects of the other problems.  Therefore, three of the mentioned factors (1, 2, and 3) significantly contributed to the crisis of the jagirdari system and the overall weakening of the Mughal Empire.\n"

The Neolithic Age saw the domestication of animals like cattle, sheep, and goats (4). The Neolithic Age chronologically follows the Palaeolithic Age (5). However, statements 1 and 3 are incorrect.  The Neolithic Age is defined by the use of polished stone tools; widespread metal use came later (1). Megalithic structures are associated with a broader time period, extending beyond the Neolithic Age (3).  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Neolithic Age in India. The cultivation of rice and domestication of animals mark a significant shift towards settled agriculture and a more complex social organization. The chronological placement of the Neolithic Age is crucial for understanding the development of human societies in India.\n"

The relationship was more complex, involving translation and adaptation rather than a simple linguistic bridge.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect.  While Sanskrit held prestige and was used in official contexts across various parts of India, it was never the *sole* official language of the entire Indian peninsula throughout any single historical period.  Many regional languages coexisted and held significant administrative roles in different regions and time periods.\n"

The Pallavas' rule extended over parts of southern Andhra (statement 1).  Kanchipuram's prominence as a center of Vedic learning under Pallava patronage is well-documented (statement 2).  The Pallavas possessed strong navies, which played a key role in their power projection (statement 3). The Kadambas, a significant dynasty in northern Karnataka, were contemporaries of the Pallavas, leading to conflicts and interactions (statement 4). The Chalukyas of Badami were another major power in the Deccan, engaging in a prolonged struggle with the Pallavas for dominance (statement 5). Finally, the Kalabhras' rebellion, a significant event that challenged the established Brahmanical order and the existing political structure, impacted the Pallavas and their contemporaries (statement 6).

Asoka's focus on religious propagation neglected crucial frontier defenses, making India vulnerable to external threats (statement 5).

Their composition in Sanskrit is a well-established fact, reflecting the language of the Vedic period. Oral transmission across generations is a key aspect of Vedic tradition, with the hymns being passed down through Brahmin families before their eventual compilation, estimated to be around 1500-1000 BCE.

Asoka's conversion to Buddhism and his subsequent patronage marked a turning point in the religion's history.  His extensive missionary efforts led to the spread of Buddhism beyond India's borders, establishing it as a major world religion.  His edicts and the support he provided were instrumental in early global dissemination.\n\nTherefore, three statements (1, 3, and 4) are accurate.\n"

While Jainism did spread to South India, epigraphic evidence suggests its significant presence in Karnataka doesn't appear before the third century AD.  Earlier presence might have existed, but concrete evidence is lacking.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  Jainas adopted Prakrit, the vernacular language, to spread their teachings among the common people, unlike the Brahmins who primarily used Sanskrit. This choice was crucial for the religion's reach.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect. The Jain Council at Pataliputra did not unify all Jain sects.  Instead, it further deepened the division, with Southern Jainas (who became known as Digambaras) refusing to accept the council's decisions.\n\n\nTherefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are NOT correct.\n"

Sufi practices, emphasizing spiritual experience and direct connection with the divine, often incorporated elements from existing religious traditions, including Hindu yogic practices. This syncretism is evident in their emphasis on meditation, asceticism, and mystical union. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 3 is incorrect.  A core tenet of Sufism is the belief in the absolute oneness of God (tawhid), a concept central to Islamic theology.  Sufis, while emphasizing direct personal experience of the divine, did not reject the concept of divine unity; rather, they sought to understand and experience it in profound ways.\n"

Digambaras are known for their tradition of monastic nudity, while Svetambaras allow monks to wear simple white clothes.  Digambaras also hold the traditional belief that women cannot become Tirthankaras, a view not shared by Svetambaras. However, statement 4 is partially incorrect. While Svetambaras do believe in the five eternal substances listed,  Digambaras also believe in these five,  the difference lies in that Digambaras add a sixth eternal substance: Time (Kala).  The key distinction lies in their differing views on the possibility of female Tirthankaras and their differing monastic practices.

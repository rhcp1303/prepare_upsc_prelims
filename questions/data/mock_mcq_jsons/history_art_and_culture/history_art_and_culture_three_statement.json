The Mughal Empire's expansion into the Deccan led to prolonged conflicts with the Rajput kingdoms, who initially resisted Mughal rule but eventually formed alliances with the imperial court.\n2.  The Persian Empire, a contemporary power, had significant cultural and diplomatic ties with the Mughal Empire, particularly during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir. These relations influenced Mughal art, architecture, and administrative practices.\n3. The Mughal Empire\u2019s interactions with the Portuguese were primarily characterized by trade, but also involved occasional conflict and competition for control of maritime trade routes.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n",

        "option_d": "2 only\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect because the primary conflicts of the Mughal Empire in the Deccan were with the Deccan Sultanates, not the Rajput kingdoms. While the Rajputs did initially resist Mughal expansion, their conflicts were largely in the north and northwest, and they eventually entered into alliances with the Mughal emperors (particularly Akbar) through a complex interplay of military subjugation and strategic marriages. Statement 2 is correct. The Mughal and Persian Empires shared close historical links through their Timurid ancestry and a shared cultural heritage.  Persian language, art, and administrative practices heavily influenced the Mughal court, especially during Akbar and Jahangir's reigns. This cultural exchange shaped Mughal art and architecture, and the diplomatic relationship provided stability and occasional military support. Statement 3 is also correct. The Mughal Empire's interactions with the Portuguese were a mix of trade and conflict. The Portuguese held significant coastal territories in India, and their control over maritime trade routes often led to rivalry and skirmishes with the Mughals.  The Mughals attempted to limit Portuguese power, but were not always successful in doing so.\n"

Aurangzeb's military campaigns in the Deccan, while initially successful in conquering kingdoms like Bijapur and Golconda, ultimately drained the empire's resources and prolonged internal instability, thereby contributing to the Mughal decline.\n3.

        "correct_option": "(d)",
        "explanation": "\n\nAll three statements accurately reflect significant aspects of Aurangzeb's reign and its impact on the Mughal Empire.  Statement 1 correctly points to the controversial religious policies of Aurangzeb.  His strict adherence to Islamic law, including the reintroduction of the jizya tax (a poll tax on non-Muslims), alienated significant portions of the Hindu population, fueling resentment and rebellion.  This religious policy directly contradicted the relatively tolerant policies of his predecessors, significantly contributing to the empire's weakening.  Statement 2 is also correct.  Aurangzeb's long and costly Deccan campaigns, while initially successful in conquering powerful Deccan kingdoms, ultimately proved to be a major drain on the empire's resources.  These campaigns stretched the Mughal military thin, created internal vulnerabilities, and diverted attention and resources away from other pressing issues.  The protracted warfare in the Deccan created opportunities for the rise of regional powers like the Marathas.  Statement 3 is accurate as well. While Aurangzeb initially succeeded in securing the throne after a brutal war of succession against his brothers, the prolonged conflicts and tensions within the imperial family further destabilized the empire.  The lack of a clear line of succession after Aurangzeb's death led to further internal struggles and weakened the empire's ability to respond to external threats.\n"

His most significant architectural legacy is arguably his tomb, a masterpiece of Mughal architecture that blends Persian and Indian styles.   The statement misrepresents the scale and nature of his building projects, presenting a distorted picture of his architectural patronage.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Humayun's military campaigns in Bengal were successful in expanding Mughal influence in that region, although this influence was also later challenged.

Akbar's conquests in the northwest, including Kashmir and Baluchistan, established a \"scientific frontier\" for the Mughal Empire, significantly enhancing its security and trade.\n2. The loss of Qandahar during Shah Jahan's reign was a major setback, undermining Mughal prestige and control over vital trade routes to Central Asia.\n3. Aurangzeb's campaigns to recapture Qandahar ultimately failed due to the inherent strength of the Qandahar fort and the limitations of Mughal artillery against well-defended fortifications.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n",

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's conquests in the northwest significantly expanded the Mughal Empire's territory, the concept of a \"scientific frontier\" is a later interpretation.  Akbar's focus was more on consolidating his control over strategically important regions rather than establishing a rigidly defined border.  The term \"scientific frontier\" is a subjective assessment, and the reality was more complex than a simple territorial demarcation.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The loss of Qandahar dealt a severe blow to the Mughal Empire.  Qandahar's strategic location and its importance as a trade hub made its loss a significant setback for Mughal prestige and control over trade routes to Central Asia.  This loss is a key factor in evaluating the limitations of Mughal power and their foreign policy challenges.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The repeated Mughal attempts to recapture Qandahar, despite considerable military resources, failed.  This failure highlights not only the strength of the Qandahar fort but also the limitations of medieval artillery in the face of strong defenses. This is a crucial point to understand the limitations of military technology of the era and the difficulties faced by the Mughal Empire in its expansionist ambitions.  The failure to recapture Qandahar was not simply a military matter, but also one of political strategy and resource allocation."

The statement exaggerates the impact of its loss on the Empire\u2019s access to precious resources.\n\n2. **Correct:** Qandahar's location near the Hindu Kush mountains and its proximity to Kabul made it a crucial strategic position.

The statement presents a distorted view of Akbar's religious policy.\n\n2. **Correct:** The *Ibadat Khana* (House of Worship) was indeed a space where Akbar invited religious scholars from various faiths to engage in discussions and debates.

The statement correctly describes the purpose and impact of the *Ibadat Khana*.\n\n3. **Incorrect:** While Akbar did introduce *Din-i Ilahi*, a syncretic faith, the abolition of the *jizya* tax predated the formal establishment of this new religion.

        "explanation": "\n\nAll three statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's reign.  Statement 1 is correct because Akbar's conquest of Gujarat was strategically important for controlling trade routes and securing access to resources.  The control of Gujarat provided the Mughal empire with access to vital ports and trade routes, which greatly enhanced their economic strength and facilitated communication within the empire. This is a significant aspect of Akbar's expansionist policies and its impact on the economic and political landscape of the Mughal empire.\n\nStatement 2 is correct as the *dahsala* system (ten-year settlement) was a crucial part of Akbar's land revenue reforms.  It aimed to improve the accuracy of land revenue assessment and provide greater stability for the peasantry, thereby promoting agricultural production and economic prosperity. This system aimed at reducing the burden on peasants and improving the efficiency of revenue collection.  It's a key example of Akbar's administrative reforms that sought to create a more just and efficient system.\n\nStatement 3 is also correct. Akbar's policy of religious tolerance, exemplified by the abolition of the *jizya* tax (a poll tax on non-Muslims), was a landmark decision intended to foster religious harmony and integrate diverse communities within his vast empire. However, this policy faced significant resistance from orthodox Muslim scholars and elements who opposed his religious syncretism and perceived it as a threat to traditional Islamic practices. The Ibadat Khana and the later Din-i Ilahi are testament to this complex interplay between religious policy and political consolidation.  The opposition highlights the challenges Akbar faced in balancing his political ambitions with the religious sensitivities of his subjects.\n"

This illustrates the tension between centralized control and local power structures in the Mughal administration.\n\nStatement 2 is accurate. The *Zabti* system, which aimed at a more accurate assessment of land productivity, did improve revenue collection in some regions.

This points to the difficulties in implementing uniform policies across diverse geographical and social landscapes.\n\nStatement 3 is also correct.  Akbar's administrative system, while striving for centralization, relied on a network of local officials (including Zamindars) for its implementation.

Statement 1 is correct: Aurangzeb's re-imposition of the *jizya* tax (a poll tax on non-Muslims) was a highly unpopular measure that significantly alienated his Hindu subjects and other religious minorities. This action reversed some of the relatively tolerant policies of his predecessors and fueled resentment, contributing to the growing instability of the empire.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Aurangzeb's prolonged Deccan campaigns, while initially successful in expanding Mughal territories, consumed enormous resources and manpower.  This diversion of resources from other parts of the empire weakened central control, leading to increased regional autonomy and uprisings in various parts of India. The prolonged and costly Deccan wars are considered a major factor in the weakening of the Mughal army and the eventual decline of the Mughal empire.\n\nStatement 3 is true as well. Aurangzeb's rigorous enforcement of Islamic law and his policies toward religious minorities like Hindus and Sikhs generated significant religious conflict.  His harsh treatment of the Rajput rulers, who had previously been important allies of the Mughals, created further disharmony and weakened the empire's social and political fabric.  This rigid religious policy is seen by many historians as a significant factor contributing to the decline of the Mughal Empire.

However, this policy was not universally accepted and faced considerable opposition from orthodox religious elements who viewed Akbar's approach with suspicion and hostility.  The policy's impact on the social and political fabric of the empire is a topic of ongoing scholarly debate.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Ibadat Khana (House of Worship) was a significant institution established by Akbar to facilitate discussions and debates on religious and philosophical matters.

His struggles to maintain his hold on Ferghana and subsequent conquests in neighboring regions formed the crucial foundation of his military experience before his eventual arrival in India.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. While Babur certainly utilized cavalry, his innovative and effective use of gunpowder artillery was a defining characteristic of his military strategy, particularly during the battles of Panipat and Khanwa. This represented a significant departure from the primarily cavalry-focused tactics common in Central Asian warfare at that time, contributing significantly to his victories. His deployment of artillery, a more advanced technology, provided a decisive edge in battles against opponents who largely relied on traditional methods.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While Babur did employ cavalry, it wasn't solely responsible for his victories. His success stemmed from a combination of factors, including his strategic acumen, effective use of artillery, and his adaptation to the diverse terrains and warfare styles he encountered during his conquests in Central Asia and India.  Attributing his victories solely to superior cavalry numbers oversimplifies his complex military strategies and underestimates the role of gunpowder technology and tactical brilliance.

Statement 2 is accurate in its description of the Permanent Settlement's impact on the Zamindari system. Lord Cornwallis's policy aimed to solidify land ownership and generate predictable revenue for the British East India Company, a policy that inadvertently empowered Zamindars by granting them hereditary rights. Statement 3 is also correct; the Ryotwari system, which directly linked the cultivator (ryot) with the state for revenue collection, significantly weakened the Zamindari system by eliminating the Zamindar's intermediary role in revenue collection.

While Sangam literature does touch upon other regions and kingdoms, its core focus remains on the three Tamil kingdoms\u2014Chera, Chola, and Pandya\u2014providing rich details of their political structures, social norms, and cultural practices.  The extent of information on other contemporary entities is less detailed and comprehensive.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct.

However, to say it *extensively* describes martial arts traditions with detailed accounts of weaponry and strategies is an overstatement. The descriptions are woven into the narratives, not presented as systematic treatises.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  *Silappathikaram* and *Manimekalai* are indeed major works of Sangam literature, and these epics are notable for their blend of narrative storytelling, exploration of social themes, and incorporation of philosophical and religious elements.

The dome, as a prominent architectural feature, became integral to the Indo-Islamic architectural tradition in India, starting with the Delhi Sultanate.

However, the statement oversimplifies the complex evolution of architectural styles. While his influence was notable, the shift wasn't solely due to his arrival; pre-existing traditions and subsequent developments also played crucial roles.  The impact of the Timurid style was significant, but it built upon and interacted with existing Indian architectural practices.

While there is ongoing scholarly debate about the relationship between the Indus Valley Civilization and the Vedic people, the Rig Veda itself does not directly describe the former.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Rig Veda repeatedly mentions the importance of cows (gau) in the Aryan society, highlighting their economic and religious significance.  Cows were a crucial part of their pastoral economy and held symbolic value. The term 'gavisthi', referring to a cow-owning community, further underscores this importance.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The Rig Veda is the earliest known example of an Indo-European language, specifically a form of early Sanskrit, not a Dravidian language. Dravidian languages form a distinct language family, geographically concentrated in South India.\n"

Alexander did face strong resistance, particularly from the Nanda dynasty in the east, which he ultimately did not conquer. The logistical challenges and the weariness of his troops after prolonged campaigns, combined with the stiff resistance, played crucial roles in his decision to withdraw.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While Alexander did establish some settlements,  their number was limited and their long-term cultural impact on India is debated by historians. The Greek influence was largely confined to the northwestern regions and was far from a widespread phenomenon across India's vast geography.  The lasting impact is more visible in art and architecture in certain regions rather than a complete cultural overhaul.\n"

This finding highlights the advanced engineering capabilities of the Indus people and their connection to distant regions through sea routes.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The Indus Valley Civilization did not have large, monumental structures like palaces and temples in the same way as later civilizations. The evidence suggests a more egalitarian urban planning, with standardized brick sizes and sophisticated drainage systems, but the absence of prominent palaces or temples challenges the notion of a highly stratified society as initially assumed.

While the concept of untouchability wasn't fully defined in the Later Vedic period, the seeds of this practice were present, becoming more entrenched in subsequent periods. The social stratification and the emergence of discriminatory practices against certain groups became more pronounced.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Untouchability is inherently discriminatory and violates fundamental human rights.

These systems helped to identify and track horses and soldiers, preventing fraud and ensuring the army's readiness. They were not directly related to revenue collection, though a strong and well-equipped army indirectly supported the Sultan's revenue-generating capabilities.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Alauddin Khalji's military campaigns significantly weakened the Rajput kingdoms in regions like Rajasthan and Gujarat. His conquests resulted in the annexation of territories and the subjugation of numerous Rajput rulers.  However, it's inaccurate to say he completely eliminated Rajput influence.  While their power was significantly reduced, Rajput resistance continued, and various Rajput principalities persisted throughout his reign and beyond.

These regions were strategically crucial, representing the gateway to the Delhi Sultanate's heartland.  The repeated Mongol assaults on these regions highlight their vulnerability and the Sultanate's constant need for defensive measures.\n\nStatement 2 correctly describes Balban's multifaceted strategy. He invested heavily in strengthening the Sultanate's military, constructing and fortifying strategic locations. Concurrently, he engaged in diplomatic maneuvers, attempting to manage the Mongol threat through negotiations and alliances.  His interactions with Hulagu Khan, a powerful Mongol leader, demonstrate this dual approach of military preparedness and diplomatic engagement.\n\nStatement 3 is also accurate. Dawa Khan's death in 1306 significantly altered the political landscape in Central Asia.  The ensuing period of internal strife and succession struggles within the Mongol empire considerably weakened the external threat to the Delhi Sultanate.

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's introduction of the token currency was indeed driven by the scarcity of precious metals in the 14th century.  His goal was to create a more efficient monetary system, less reliant on the fluctuating availability of gold and silver. Though the experiment ultimately failed due to issues of forgery and public acceptance, its initial intention was to address a significant economic challenge.  This reflects his ambitious, albeit sometimes flawed, approach to economic management.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The relocation of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogir) was largely motivated by a desire to exert greater control over the Deccan region.  The Deccan had witnessed rebellions, and the new capital was intended to facilitate a more direct and effective administration of the southern territories. The move was a strategic decision to improve governance and control, even if it proved ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq did not completely abandon all of his father's policies. While he introduced several radical reforms and experiments, he also continued some of his father's administrative practices and policies.  His reign was marked by both continuity and change, not a complete break from his predecessor's policies.  Attributing his reign solely to a complete abandonment of his father's policies oversimplifies a complex historical context.\n"

He implemented strict policies, curtailed the influence of powerful nobles (especially the Chahalgani), and established a centralized administration. His focus was on creating a strong, centralized monarchy to prevent internal strife and maintain stability. His policies, while harsh, contributed to a period of relative peace and stability in the Delhi Sultanate.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Iltutmish consolidated the rule of the Turkish Mamluks *after* the death of *Aibak*, not after his own death.  The statement incorrectly attributes the consolidation to a period after Iltutmish's death, confusing the timeline of events.  Iltutmish's actions were instrumental in establishing a stable and centralized government following the death of Aibak, laying the foundation for future rulers of the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's successful naval campaigns resulted in the Chola navy dominating the Bay of Bengal for a considerable period. This dominance gave rise to the metaphorical description of the Bay of Bengal as a 'Chola Lake', highlighting the extent of their naval power and control over maritime trade routes.  This reflects the Chola Empire's significant naval capabilities and their influence over the Indian Ocean region.\n"

The Cholas' expansion was a complex interplay of military victories, diplomatic maneuvers, and economic factors.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I significantly expanded the Chola empire through ambitious naval campaigns. These expeditions reached across the Bay of Bengal and into Southeast Asia, impacting the political landscape of regions like Srivijaya, and establishing a far-reaching network of trade and influence.  This naval prowess was a key element of Chola power and prosperity.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The Chola economy was significantly boosted by maritime trade, alongside land revenue.

The primary court historian for Mahmud was  Al-Utbi, but there are multiple texts describing his reign, some written after his death.

The university's development was a gradual process spanning several centuries and involving multiple rulers and scholars.  The curriculum likely evolved over time, encompassing various subjects beyond Buddhist philosophy.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. While there's ongoing scholarly debate about the precise extent of Aryabhata's connection to Nalanda, strong evidence suggests he studied there and contributed significantly to its intellectual atmosphere.

        "explanation": "\n\nAll three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Lodi Dynasty's final years and its downfall. Ibrahim Lodi's efforts to consolidate his power and create a strong centralized state alienated many powerful Afghan chiefs who felt their autonomy threatened.  This dissatisfaction, coupled with the discontent among Rajput rulers, created a volatile political landscape ripe for exploitation by external forces. Daulat Khan Lodi, a prominent Afghan governor of Punjab, exemplifies this internal conflict.  He initially tried to appease Ibrahim Lodi through diplomatic overtures, sending his son as a gesture of loyalty. However, sensing the weakness of the Lodi Sultanate, Daulat Khan ultimately switched allegiance to Babur, inviting him to invade India. The Battle of Panipat in 1526 served as the decisive clash between Babur's Mughal forces and Ibrahim Lodi's army. Babur's victory decisively ended the Lodi rule in Delhi and marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire's dominance in North India.  The battle's significance lies not just in the change of power but also in the strategic shift in the political dynamics of the region.\n"

Statement 1 correctly identifies the distinct roles of Sanskrit and Prakrit. Sanskrit was primarily used by the elite and in formal settings, while Prakrit served as the vernacular language for common people and was used in various literary forms. Statement 2 accurately reflects the linguistic practices in Gupta-era Sanskrit plays, where a clear distinction was often made in dialogue between the higher castes (using Sanskrit) and lower castes (using Prakrit).  This demonstrates a social stratification reflected in language usage. Statement 3 correctly distinguishes Pali from Prakrit, highlighting Pali's crucial role within the Buddhist tradition.  While originating from Prakrit, Pali evolved its own distinct characteristics and became the canonical language of Theravada Buddhism.  Therefore, all three statements provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of the complex interplay of languages in ancient Indian literature and society."

The Satavahana *vishayas* (administrative units)  show parallels with Asoka's administrative divisions, although the exact terminology and structure may have varied.  The concept of a hierarchical system, with regional and local officials reporting to higher authorities, was common to both. The core concept of organized administrative units with a chain of command is accurate.\n"

The early centers of Buddhist activity were located in areas like Lumbini, Bodh Gaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar.  The spread to the south was a later development.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Satavahana dynasty played a crucial role in supporting and promoting Buddhism.  They commissioned the construction of numerous stupas, chaityas, and viharas, providing significant patronage that aided the religion's spread and development, particularly in the Deccan region.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The decline of Buddhism in India was a complex process influenced by several factors.  While some rulers may have shown less favor towards Buddhism, or even engaged in limited persecution, the Gupta dynasty's role wasn't solely responsible.  Other factors such as the rise of Brahmanical Hinduism, the influence of Bhakti movements, and internal divisions within Buddhism itself also contributed significantly to its eventual decline.  Attributing the decline solely to the Gupta dynasty is an oversimplification of a complex historical process.\n"

The recitation of poetry, particularly qasidas and ghazals, often accompanied by music and dance, was a vital part of Sufi practices.  These recitations were intended to create an atmosphere of spiritual ecstasy and enhance the devotional experience for both the performers and the audience.  This was an important method of spreading Sufi teachings and attracting followers.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  Sufi practices incorporated elements of meditation (muraqaba) and breath control (sam\u0101) techniques, although their methods and emphasis differed from those found in other traditions.

The spread of Jainism to South India is primarily attributed to the migration of Jain ascetics fleeing a major famine in Magadha.\n2.  Chandragupta Maurya's conversion to Jainism and his subsequent retreat to Karnataka significantly contributed to its presence in the south.\n3.

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  Historical accounts suggest that a significant migration of Jain monks from Magadha to South India occurred following a severe famine. This migration played a crucial role in establishing Jain communities and spreading Jain teachings in the southern regions.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct but requires nuance. While the tradition of Chandragupta Maurya's conversion and retreat to Karnataka exists, there's limited corroborating evidence from other historical sources.  While his conversion might have had some symbolic impact, attributing the *primary* spread of Jainism in Karnataka solely to him is an oversimplification. The famine-driven migration likely played a more significant role.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Jainism did significantly impact South India's religious landscape, establishing strong communities and leaving behind a rich legacy of temples, sculptures, and literature.  The influence of Jainism is evident in the architectural marvels and religious practices of South India, demonstrating its wide acceptance and impact in the region.\n"

The Four Noble Truths, the core tenets of Buddhism, directly address the problem of social and economic inequalities and propose specific solutions for their eradication.\n3.

The formation of the Sangha with his first five disciples is a central event in Buddhist history.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the Four Noble Truths address the fundamental nature of suffering (dukkha) and its origins in craving and attachment, they don't directly offer specific socio-economic solutions.  The Buddha's teachings primarily focus on individual liberation from suffering through ethical conduct, meditation, and wisdom.  However, the principles of compassion and non-violence inherent in Buddhist philosophy indirectly impacted social structures and attitudes.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Nirvana is the ultimate goal in Buddhism, representing a state of liberation from the cycle of suffering (samsara) and the attainment of enlightenment.  Achieving Nirvana is considered the transcendence of suffering and the attainment of a state of peace and bliss.  It is obtained through the practice of the Eightfold Path, which encompasses ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom.\n"

While both Jainism and Buddhism originated in the Gangetic valley, Buddhism saw a significantly wider and faster geographical spread, particularly during the Mauryan empire under Ashoka's patronage.  Jainism, while influential, had a more localized expansion, primarily concentrated in certain regions of India.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the Digambara sect did eventually spread to Karnataka and other areas, its origins are not exclusively tied to that region.  The initial schism between the Digambaras and Svetambaras occurred in Magadha, following a council in Pataliputra.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Svetambara sect, while having its origins in Magadha, did expand geographically over time, though perhaps not as rapidly as Buddhism.  The assertion that it resisted significant expansion is not entirely accurate. Both sects saw expansion, but at different paces and to different regions.  The historical records show that both Digambara and Svetambara sects underwent geographical expansion, though their centers of influence differed.\n"

Kushinagar is the place where the Buddha attained Parinirvana (death).  This highlights a common misconception regarding the location of his first sermon.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The interpretation of Nirvana is complex and varies among different Buddhist schools.  While it does involve the cessation of suffering, the concept of the complete annihilation of the self is not universally accepted within Buddhism.  Some schools emphasize a more nuanced understanding of Nirvana as a transcendent state.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  While Ananda was a close companion and disciple of the Buddha, he was not nominated to lead the Sangha.  The leadership of the Sangha was not established through a single designated successor. This illustrates the decentralized nature of early Buddhist leadership. The absence of a clear succession plan after the Buddha's death led to the emergence of various schools and interpretations of Buddhist teachings.\n"

While the Alvars were indeed associated with Vaishnavism and the Bhakti movement in South India, their primary opposition was not directed solely at Buddhism and Jainism.  Their focus was on promoting devotion to Vishnu and Krishna, often using allegorical narratives and poetry to convey their messages. The Alvars\u2019 influence stemmed from their poetic compositions, not direct confrontation with other religious traditions.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Kabir's philosophy predates Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi by several decades.  Kabir, active in the 15th century, advocated for a monotheistic faith that rejected ritualistic practices and caste distinctions found in both Hinduism and Islam.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure of the Naqshbandi Sufi order, lived in the 16th and 17th centuries and championed a more orthodox interpretation of Islam, directly opposing Akbar's religious syncretism.  Therefore, any influence would be the other way around, with Kabir potentially influencing Akbar's policies, which Sirhindi opposed.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Bhakti movement, characterized by the prominence of saint-poets, significantly utilized devotional song and music (*kirtans*, *bhajans*) as a means of spreading their message of devotion.  The *kirtans* popularized by Chaitanya are a prime example of this, and the use of vernacular languages made these messages accessible to a wider population, regardless of caste or creed.

Digambara Jainism, while present, has had a comparatively lesser impact on the state's cultural landscape.\n2.

The epic poem itself is a cornerstone of Persian literature and reflects the cultural milieu of the time.\n\nStatement 2 is partially correct but requires nuance. Barani's *Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi* does focus extensively on Alauddin Khalji's reign, providing detailed accounts of his economic policies and military actions. However,  to say it *neglects* cultural aspects is an oversimplification. While his primary focus is on political and economic history, the narrative inherently touches upon cultural aspects through the context of the events described.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The widespread use of Persian in various Indian courts profoundly impacted the development of Indian literature.  Many literary works were composed in Persian, and the language itself influenced the style and themes of works written in other Indian languages. This cultural exchange significantly contributed to the rich tapestry of Indian literary history.

The Battle of Talikota (1565) dealt a devastating blow to the Vijayanagara Empire, significantly weakening it, but the empire's decline was a gradual process spanning several decades before and after this event.  Statement 2 is correct. Krishna Deva Raya's reign is considered the golden age of the Vijayanagara Empire, marked by significant achievements in art, literature, architecture, and administration. Statement 3 is also correct. The Vijayanagara Empire possessed a powerful navy, which was essential for controlling their extensive coastline, facilitating trade, and defending against maritime threats.  The statement might be considered misleading because the empire's naval power is not as well documented as its land-based military power, but it did play a significant role.\n"

Mughal painting reached its zenith during the reign of Akbar, characterized by a blend of Persian and Indian artistic styles.\n2.  Jahangir, himself a keen patron of arts, shifted the emphasis in Mughal painting from illustrated manuscripts to individual portraits and album art, showcasing a greater focus on realism and naturalism.\n3.

Akbar's reign is widely considered the golden age of Mughal painting, marked by a synthesis of Persian and Indian artistic traditions, resulting in a unique style. Jahangir's patronage led to a shift towards more realistic and naturalistic portraiture, moving away from the large-scale illustrated manuscripts that dominated Akbar's era.  Statement 3, however, is a misleading oversimplification. While Shah Jahan's reign is more renowned for its architectural achievements, Mughal painting continued, though perhaps with less dramatic innovation than under Akbar and Jahangir. It didn't experience a significant *decline* in quality. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct. The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 3.\n"

The caves are a combination of Chaityas (prayer halls) and Viharas (monasteries), demonstrating the architectural sophistication of the time.  The presence of both hall types reflects the multifaceted nature of Buddhist monastic life and practice during the period of construction.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  The Ajanta murals are globally celebrated for their exceptional artistic merit and preservation. Their creation involved a sophisticated tempera technique, employing natural pigments derived from minerals, plants, and insects. The use of a carefully prepared plaster base on the cave walls was crucial for the adherence and longevity of the vibrant colors.

Their patronage resulted in the construction of a large number of temples, representing a high point in medieval Indian temple architecture.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Khajuraho temples are primarily constructed from sandstone, not granite.  Sandstone's relatively softer nature allowed for the intricate carving and detailing characteristic of the temples. Granite, known for its hardness, is not typically used in such complex, highly ornamented structures.\n"

While a sophisticated trading system existed, it was not necessarily supported by a strong central authority for large-scale planning.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Archaeological evidence, including the remains of cotton fibers and spindle whorls,  points towards a significant textile industry in the Indus Valley Civilization.  While the exact scale and complexity might not be fully understood due to incomplete excavations, it's inaccurate to characterize the textile industry as \"limited\" compared to later periods based on current evidence.\n\nStatement 3 is largely correct.  The discovery of numerous granaries in various sites like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa points towards the efficient storage and management of agricultural surpluses, suggesting a significant focus on agriculture and food security. However, the precise agricultural techniques employed by the Indus people remain a subject of ongoing research and debate, making the statement partially true.  The existence of granaries points to a degree of centralized planning, but the extent of this remains an area of active scholarly discussion.\n"

The Nagara style, predominantly found in North India, is characterized by its curvilinear shikhara (tower), while the Dravida style, common in South India, features a pyramidal structure. The Vesara style represents a blend of both.\n2.  The rock-cut architecture of Ajanta and Ellora caves showcases the development of sophisticated carving techniques, but their structural designs differ significantly from the free-standing temples of later periods.\n3.  The Khajuraho temples, known for their intricate sculptures, represent a unique fusion of Nagara and Dravida styles, resulting in a distinct architectural character, but their construction doesn't reflect any significant influence from the Gupta period.\n\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 accurately describes the fundamental differences between the Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles of temple architecture. The curvilinear shikhara is a hallmark of the Nagara style, while the pyramidal vimana is characteristic of the Dravida style. The Vesara style is indeed a hybrid, incorporating elements from both.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The rock-cut architecture of Ajanta and Ellora, while demonstrating remarkable carving skills, represents a different approach to temple construction compared to the free-standing structures that became prevalent in later periods.  The caves are essentially carved into existing rock formations, whereas later temples were built using separate blocks of stone or brick.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Khajuraho temples are indeed renowned for their sculptures and exhibit a unique blend of architectural styles, this style does reflect influences from the Gupta period in terms of sculptural detailing and certain ornamental elements.  Ignoring Gupta influence is a significant oversight.\n"

Its initial simplicity gave way to increasingly ornate features.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the Ajanta caves are indeed masterpieces of Buddhist art, their architectural style is not primarily inspired by the early Gupta period.  The cave architecture predates the Gupta Empire and reflects indigenous rock-cut traditions associated with Buddhist monastic practices.  Gupta influence might be present in some decorative elements, but it's not the primary architectural inspiration.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Amaravati stupa's distinctive sculptural style clearly shows the influence of the Satavahana period, a local dynasty of the region.

This contributed to a more centralized and efficient administration, diminishing the influence of localized, often fragmented, tribal loyalties.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Mansabdari system, while a significant reform, did not entirely replace the Jagir system.  Instead, it coexisted and interacted with the Jagir system, often complementing it.  The Mansabdari system focused on assigning ranks and responsibilities to officials, while the Jagir system dealt with the land grants given to these officials as part of their remuneration. Both systems played crucial roles in Akbar's administrative structure.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  While Akbar introduced innovative elements into his revenue system (like the Dahsala system), the annual assessment of land productivity remained a crucial component.  This method, adapted and refined from previous systems, was essential for determining tax rates and ensuring a steady flow of revenue to the imperial treasury.  The emphasis on annual assessment ensured the system's adaptability to fluctuating agricultural yields.\n"

While other sources like military booty and taxes on trade certainly contributed, land revenue remained consistently paramount.\n\nThe other options are incorrect. Although Humayun and Aurangzeb utilized military booty and the Jizya tax respectively, these were not their principal sources of revenue. Akbar's reign saw a diversification of revenue streams, but land revenue remained the cornerstone of his fiscal system. Thus, option (a) correctly highlights a key aspect of Mughal economic administration. The question assesses factual recall and conceptual understanding of the Mughal fiscal system, requiring accurate knowledge of the relative importance of various revenue sources.

Mauza                    :   Rebellious territory\n2. Upari                    :   A category of proprietary tenure under the Mughal rule\n3.

        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe definition of Tmam is correct; it accurately describes land grants to religious and learned individuals. Mauza typically referred to a revenue village, not necessarily a rebellious territory. Upari, while related to land tenure, was a term primarily associated with the Maratha period, not the Mughal rule. This question tests the candidate's understanding of land tenure systems in medieval India and their associated terminology. The distractors play on the possible ambiguity of some terms and their broader contexts, making it crucial for candidates to have precise knowledge.  The correct answer demonstrates the candidate\u2019s ability to differentiate between nuanced aspects of land tenure systems."

        "explanation": "\n\nShah Jahan's reign is well-known for the extensive use of the Jagir system, a land grant system that rewarded loyal nobles and officials with land in return for military service and administrative responsibilities. While the system existed before, Shah Jahan's reign saw its considerable expansion and influence on the Mughal administrative structure. The Jagir system was integral to the functioning of the Mughal state during this period.\n\nAkbar is rightly associated with the introduction of the Mansabdari system, a crucial military and administrative framework that organized the Mughal army and bureaucracy. This system was a highly sophisticated system that integrated military and civil administration. The Mansabdari system played a pivotal role in maintaining the Mughal Empire's power and control.\n\nOption 1 is incorrect. Though Aurangzeb did implement revenue reforms, attributing them solely to the Zabt system is an oversimplification. The Zabt system, while significant, wasn't the only revenue measure in his reign. His revenue policies were more complex and encompassed several approaches.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of nuanced historical details, and the ability to accurately link Mughal emperors with specific policies, testing the ability to recognize oversimplifications.\n\n\n"

This victory solidified Vijayanagara's control over a substantial region and showcased the military capabilities of the kingdom.  This conflict had lasting effects on the political map of South India and the balance of power in the region.\n\nOption 2 is incorrect. While Deva Raya II's reign was a period of internal strife in the Vijayanagara Empire, the internal reforms mentioned were actually carried out by Mahmud Gawan, who was a chief minister in the *Bahmani* kingdom, not Vijayanagara.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific rulers and associate them with their accurate achievements.

Mohenjo-daro is renowned for its sophisticated urban planning, including a large granary and the Great Bath, however, the giant water reservoir is a feature of Dholavira.  Harappa is known for its two rows of six granaries situated on a large platform. Lothal, a significant port city, possessed a dockyard; it did *not* lack a citadel.  Rakhigarhi is considered the largest Indus Valley Civilization site in India, not Dholavira.  The presence of a dockyard is associated with Lothal, showcasing its maritime importance.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 5 are accurately matched.  The other options include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a need for precise knowledge of individual site features within the Indus Valley Civilization.

Gautamiputra Satakarni, a significant Satavahana ruler, is credited with defeating the Sakas and revitalizing the dynasty's power. The Kushan Empire's strategic location allowed them to control a substantial portion of the Silk Road, facilitating extensive trade. Chandragupta II's reign saw the minting of silver coins following his victory over the Western Satraps, signifying economic expansion. Finally, Kharavela, a ruler of Kalinga, is recognized for his significant patronage of Jainism, as evidenced by his association with Jain cave monuments and inscriptions.  Each pair represents a distinct but verifiable fact from the history of these dynasties and rulers.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Later Vedic Period is associated with the Painted Grey Ware culture, a distinct archaeological horizon. The Gupta period, while having a centralized core, also saw a degree of decentralization through land grants and increased power of regional entities. Option 1 is incorrect. While the Harappan civilization was advanced, the extensive use of iron tools is more characteristic of later periods in Indian history.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Understanding the technological and administrative features of each period is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of Indian history."

Let's analyze each pair:\n\n1. **Basavanna and Vaishnavism:** Basavanna is incorrectly paired with Vaishnavism. He was the founder of the Virashaivism (or Lingayatism) movement in Karnataka, a Shaivite sect emphasizing devotion to Shiva.  Vaishnavism, on the other hand, centers on the worship of Vishnu. This pairing demonstrates a common misconception stemming from the broad umbrella of the Bhakti movement, which encompassed various schools of devotion.\n\n2. **Ramananda and Nirguna Bhakti:**  Ramananda is wrongly linked with Nirguna Bhakti. While he was a significant figure in the Bhakti movement, his teachings emphasized the worship of Rama, a Saguna form of the divine (God with attributes). Nirguna Bhakti, conversely, focuses on the formless, attributeless aspect of the divine. This error highlights the nuances within Bhakti, often overlooked in simplistic categorizations.\n\n3. **Chaitanya and Smartism:** Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's association with Smartism is also incorrect. He is primarily identified with the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, a branch of Vaishnavism characterized by intense devotion to Krishna. Smartism, in contrast, is a Shakta sect focused on the worship of Shakti.

Pairing them with Vishnu reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of their religious identity.  The distinction between Shaivism (worship of Shiva) and Vaishnavism (worship of Vishnu) is a key element in understanding the religious landscape of the period.\n\n2. **Alvars and Shakti:** The Alvars, a group of Vaishnava saints, are incorrectly associated with Shakti.  Shakti represents the divine feminine energy in Hinduism. The Alvars\u2019 devotion was entirely focused on Vishnu and his various incarnations, particularly Krishna.  This incorrect pairing highlights the need for precise knowledge of the different devotional traditions within the Bhakti movement.\n\n3. **Kabir Panthis and Brahma:** The Kabir Panthis were followers of Kabir, a prominent figure who transcended traditional religious boundaries.  He emphasized a monotheistic conception of God, not Brahma specifically. Brahma is one of the Hindu trinity, but Kabir's teachings aimed at unifying the essence of various faiths, not adhering to any particular Hindu deity.

Accurate identification of these philosophical traditions and their founders is essential for understanding the intellectual history of India.\n\n1. **Purva-Mimamsa and Kumarila Bhatta:** This pairing is correct. Kumarila Bhatta was a leading figure in the Purva-Mimamsa school, known for his meticulous interpretation of the Brahmanas and his emphasis on ritualistic practices. His contribution significantly shaped the understanding and development of this school.\n\n2. **Lokayata and Gautama:** This is incorrect. While Lokayata is a materialistic school of philosophy, its founder is not Gautama. Gautama is associated with the Nyaya school of philosophy, which focuses on logic and epistemology.  Attributing Lokayata to Gautama demonstrates a confusion between two distinct philosophical traditions. The founder of Lokayata is traditionally considered to be Brihaspati, though there is limited historical information available on him.\n\n3. **Vedanta and Ramanuja:** This pairing is also correct.  Ramanuja was a highly influential figure in the Vedanta school of philosophy, particularly known for his Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) which posits a qualified unity between the individual soul and Brahman. His work greatly impacted the development and interpretation of Vedanta.\n\n\nTherefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  The question effectively assesses the candidate\u2019s knowledge of philosophical schools and their founders, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between similar-sounding or conceptually related but distinct schools of thought.\n\n"

Let's analyze the other options:\n\n* **Option 1:**  Ashtadhyayi is incorrectly attributed to Patanjali.  While Patanjali is a significant figure in Sanskrit grammar, the Ashtadhyayi is primarily attributed to Panini. Patanjali wrote the Mahabhashya, a commentary on Panini's work.\n\n* **Option 2:** Arthashastra is incorrectly attributed to Vishnugupta. While there's debate about the author's identity,  the most widely accepted attribution is to Kautilya or Chanakya.  Vishnugupta is sometimes considered a possible alternative name for Chanakya, but it's not a definitive or universally accepted attribution.\n\n* **Option 3:** Kamasutra is incorrectly attributed to Bhartrihari.  The Kamasutra is authored by Vatsyayana. Bhartrihari is known for his poetry, not for treatises on sexual conduct.\n\n* **Option 4:** Rajatarangini is correctly attributed to Kalhana.  This historical chronicle of Kashmir is a well-established work of Kalhana.\n\n* **Option 5:** Gaudavaho is correctly attributed to Vakpati. This Sanskrit epic poem is well known to be written by Vakpati.\n\nTherefore, only option (d) contains a completely accurate pairing. The other options present significant historical inaccuracies regarding authorship of major literary works.

However, Iltutmish's attempts to invade Gujarat were not entirely successful. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer. This question challenges candidates to demonstrate knowledge of Gujarat's political history, its rulers, and significant events, requiring the precise recall of historical details.

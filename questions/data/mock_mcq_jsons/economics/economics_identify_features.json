This is a crucial factor in its cultivation, determining optimal planting times and geographical suitability.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crops simultaneously in the same field, is a common agricultural technique. Pigeon pea and sorghum are frequently intercropped due to their complementary growth characteristics and resource utilization.  Sorghum's taller stature provides shade to the pigeon pea, while the pigeon pea fixes nitrogen in the soil, benefiting the sorghum. This efficient land use maximizes yield and reduces resource competition.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Green manure, which consists of plants plowed into the soil to improve fertility, is a key component of organic farming. By decomposing, green manure enriches the soil with essential nutrients, improving soil structure, and suppressing weeds.  This practice reduces reliance on synthetic fertilizers, a core principle of organic agriculture. Therefore, all three statements are accurate reflections of established agricultural practices.\n"

While increases in oil prices (2) can contribute to inflation, it is primarily cost-push inflation (supply-side).\n"

        "explanation": " All four factors significantly impacted the Indian economy's transformation in the 20th century.\n\n1. **Influx of gold and silver:** The arrival of precious metals during the Portuguese era, while not directly shaping the 20th-century economy, laid the groundwork for early trade and economic activity that contributed to subsequent developments.  This initial economic activity influenced the colonial economy that would later transform into the modern Indian economy.\n\n2. **Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI):**  ISI, a key economic policy of the post-independence era, aimed to reduce reliance on imports by promoting domestic industries. This significantly shaped the industrial landscape and the overall economic structure of India.\n\n3. **License Raj:**  The License Raj, a system of extensive licensing and permits required for industrial activity, had a profound impact on the Indian economy. While it aimed to regulate and control industrial growth, it also contributed to inefficiency and hindered growth in several sectors.\n\n4. **Shift from agriculture to services:** The gradual shift of the Indian economy from an agrarian base to a service-based economy is a defining characteristic of its 20th-century transformation. This shift reflects broader economic modernization and globalization trends.  Therefore, all four elements are crucial in understanding the evolution of the Indian economy in the 20th century.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete representations of this complex historical process.\n"

Statement 1 is largely true; a majority of agricultural loans are short-term, intended to cover expenses like seeds, fertilizers, and labor during a single cropping season. Statement 2 is also correct; before the Green Revolution, informal sources like moneylenders played a dominant role, often exploiting farmers with high interest rates. Statement 3 accurately reflects NABARD's function as a coordinating body for various institutions involved in rural finance. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while the nationalization of banks in 1969 significantly reduced the dominance of moneylenders, it did not completely eliminate their presence or exploitation in all areas.  Statement 5 is false; while SHGs play a crucial role, they don't exclusively cater to agricultural credit; they provide micro-credit for diverse purposes including consumption needs. Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) are accurate.\n"

Reducing social welfare spending (2) is socially undesirable and could exacerbate inequality. Increasing GST on essential commodities (4) would disproportionately affect low-income households. Option 3, encouraging private investment in public infrastructure through PPPs, is a more sustainable and socially responsible approach.  PPPs can leverage private capital to fund infrastructure projects, reducing the government's direct financial burden and stimulating economic growth without the negative social consequences of the other options.\n"

This substantial increase in food grain production significantly reduced India's reliance on food imports, enhancing food security.\n\nStatement 4 is partially correct but needs clarification. While Norman Borlaug is rightly considered the \"Father of the Green Revolution,\" his contribution was primarily in developing HYV seeds, particularly wheat, in Mexico.  The successful adaptation and implementation of the Green Revolution in India involved the efforts of many Indian scientists, policymakers, and agricultural extension workers alongside Borlaug's contribution.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at market prices is the most commonly used measure of national income, encompassing the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders.  However, GNP at factor cost is not a direct measure; it requires adjustments from market prices to factor costs (excluding indirect taxes and subsidies).

Therefore, only three of the listed features are core tenets of socialism.\n"

However, the RBI increasingly relies on other indicators like CPI. Statement 3 is correct. The RBI plays a crucial role in overseeing and regulating the payments system in India, promoting efficiency and safety in financial transactions. Statement 4 is correct. The RBI was established in 1935, under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, well before India's independence in 1947. Statement 5 is incorrect.  While the RBI manages a significant portion of government securities, it doesn't directly manage *all* issuances.  The government also plays a role in the issuance process.

FDI implies a long-term investment with a significant degree of control, which distinguishes it from FPI's more short-term and less controlling nature.\n"

The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is designed for countries facing short-term balance of payments problems.\n2.  Stand-by Arrangements (SBA) provide precautionary financial support.\n3.  The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) offers rapid financial assistance to countries facing severe crises.\n4.  The Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) is intended for countries experiencing exceptional circumstances.\n5.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 5 is correct; India is indeed a net lender to the IMF.  Statement 4 is also correct; the RCF provides rapid financial assistance to countries facing exceptional circumstances, often natural disasters or other severe shocks.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. The EFF is designed for countries facing *medium-term* balance of payments problems requiring longer-term support than a standard SBA. Statement 2 is incorrect because SBAs primarily provide financial support *during* crises, not as a precaution.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The FCL provides rapid financial assistance to countries with *strong* economic fundamentals and a proven track record of sound policies, not necessarily those facing severe crises.  Therefore, only statements 4 and 5 are correct.\n"

        "question_text": "Consider the following regarding India's foreign trade and economic policies:**\n\n1.  India's foreign trade as a proportion of GDP has consistently increased since 1985-86.\n2.  In 2004-05, India's imports constituted a larger percentage of its GDP than its exports.\n3.  Safeguard duties are imposed on imports from specific countries to protect domestic industries.\n4.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is responsible for preparing India's Balance of Payments (BoP) reports.\n5.

In the specified period, imports exceeded exports. The RBI is indeed responsible for compiling India's BoP data, adhering to IMF standards.  Finally, India's current account has fluctuated between surpluses and deficits over the given period.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Safeguard duties are temporary measures applied to protect domestic industries from surges in *any* country's imports, not specifically targeted at particular nations.  They are a WTO-compliant response to import spikes.  Therefore, only four of the statements are correct.\n"

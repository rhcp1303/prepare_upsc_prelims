However, it's a critical misconception that the MSP applies to *all* agricultural produce.  The government announces MSPs for a select group of crops deemed important for food security and farmer welfare.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the MSP is not a blanket guarantee for all agricultural products.  Similarly, Statement 2 is false because while FCI plays a major role in procurement at MSP, it doesn't handle all procurement across all states and commodities. Private players and state-level agencies also participate.  Statement 3 correctly highlights that MSP significantly influences the market price, especially for major commodities like rice. Although its impact varies across different crops and regions due to factors like market dynamics and storage capacity, the MSP acts as a price floor, thus offering some price stability for farmers.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.\n"

This contrasts with smaller-scale, diversified farming practices prevalent in other agricultural sectors.  The large-scale nature of Indian tea plantations is a significant characteristic.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While steep slopes can pose challenges, the Himalayan foothills and parts of western Java are indeed major tea-growing areas globally.  These regions have microclimates suitable for tea, although careful management of slopes and water resources is essential.  Rainfall patterns, while variable, are not inherently unsuitable.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While Vizhinjam International Seaport is a significant port, it's not a primary export hub for Indian tea.  Other ports, particularly those in Kolkata and other eastern coastal locations, handle a larger volume of tea exports. The statement misrepresents the primary export channels for Indian tea.

The mission aims for a broader diversification of energy sources.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. India is a major consumer of coal, consistently ranking among the top five global consumers.  Its substantial coal reserves and coal-fired power plants make it heavily reliant on coal for electricity generation, despite growing efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources.\n"

While the Indian government does provide subsidies on fertilizers, these subsidies are not universally applied and their impact on the cost of production varies depending on several factors.  The level of subsidy, the type of fertilizer, and the farmer's access to the subsidy program all play a role.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of subsidies in achieving intended outcomes is a subject of ongoing debate.  Some argue that subsidies distort market mechanisms and may not always reach the intended beneficiaries.\n"

The Lorenz curve is a visual tool used to illustrate income distribution.  A perfectly equal distribution is represented by a straight diagonal line (45-degree line), where the cumulative percentage of the population corresponds exactly to the cumulative percentage of income.  Any deviation from this line, resulting in a bowed curve, indicates income inequality. The degree of bowing directly relates to the Gini coefficient; a more pronounced bow signifies a higher Gini coefficient and greater income inequality.

Lending rates are primarily influenced by the repo rate and market forces.\n\n\nStatement 3 is correct. OMOs are a crucial monetary policy tool.  When the RBI buys government securities, it injects liquidity into the system, potentially lowering interest rates and stimulating economic growth. Conversely, selling securities withdraws liquidity, increasing interest rates and potentially curbing inflation.  OMOs directly impact both the money supply and interest rates, influencing both inflation and economic growth.\n\n\nTherefore, statements 1 and 3 accurately describe the effects of specific RBI monetary policy tools, making option (b) the correct answer.\n\n"

Subsidies on farm machinery and equipment are a common feature of agricultural support policies globally, including India.  These subsidies aim to improve agricultural productivity and efficiency by making modern farming technology accessible to farmers.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While poverty reduction is a significant goal of many subsidy programs, it is not the exclusive aim. Subsidies also serve other crucial economic and social objectives.  For example, subsidies on food and fuel can stabilize prices, ensuring affordability for the general population.  Subsidies in education and healthcare aim to improve human capital.  Therefore, framing subsidies as solely focused on poverty reduction is an oversimplification and an inaccurate representation of their multifaceted role in the economy.  The scope of subsidies extends to broader social and economic goals beyond just poverty alleviation.\n"

However, it's also possible for 'crowding out' to occur, where increased government borrowing raises interest rates, making it more expensive for private businesses to borrow and invest. The outcome depends on various economic factors, including the state of the economy and the nature of government spending.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  The FRBMA, a key fiscal policy reform in India, aims to improve fiscal discipline by mandating the reduction of fiscal deficits and revenue deficits. It focuses on long-term macroeconomic stability and intergenerational equity by limiting government borrowing and improving transparency in fiscal operations.  It emphasizes sustainable fiscal management.\n\n"

They are essentially the government's income from taxes, non-tax revenue, and grants. Capital receipts, on the other hand, increase the government's liabilities or reduce its assets; examples include borrowings, disinvestment proceeds, and recovery of loans.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Revenue deficit is calculated as the difference between total revenue expenditure and total revenue receipts. A positive revenue deficit implies that the government is spending more than its revenue earnings, leading to dissaving and necessitating borrowing to finance its consumption expenditure.  This is a cause for concern as it indicates unsustainable fiscal practices.\n\nStatement 3 is partially incorrect. While a fiscal deficit does represent the government\u2019s total borrowing requirement, it\u2019s not *always* financed solely by borrowing.  It can also be partially financed through non-debt creating capital receipts such as the recovery of loans or disinvestment proceeds.  The fiscal deficit indicates the overall financing gap between total expenditure and total receipts (excluding borrowings).  The complete financing of the deficit involves both borrowing and non-debt creating capital receipts.\n"

Despite high savings rates, a high capital-output ratio can prevent significant increases in output because it means a large increase in capital investment is required to generate a small increase in output, highlighting inefficiencies in capital allocation.\n3.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates, calculated by comparing prices of identical baskets of goods and services, correctly reflect the relative size of national economies by adjusting for differences in the cost of living across countries; hence India's ranking as the sixth-largest economy in terms of PPP dollars is an accurate reflection of its economic size.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

A rise in GNP without corresponding improvements in poverty and unemployment indicates that the benefits of growth haven't been distributed equitably.  This highlights the importance of considering social indicators alongside economic indicators in evaluating development.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The capital-output ratio (COR) measures the amount of capital investment needed to produce one unit of output. A high COR implies that capital is not being used efficiently.  Even with high savings, if the COR is high, the increase in output from investment may be limited, preventing substantial economic growth despite significant capital formation. This points towards potential inefficiencies in resource allocation and the need for structural reforms to improve productivity.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While PPP exchange rates do adjust for differences in cost of living, making comparisons of economic size across countries more meaningful, they are not without limitations.  The methodology for calculating PPP rates involves several assumptions and complexities, and the resulting figures can still be subject to some degree of error or misinterpretation.  Therefore, claiming that India's sixth-largest economy ranking in PPP dollars is an entirely accurate reflection of its economic size is an oversimplification and a potentially misleading claim.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Green Revolution, while highly successful in boosting wheat and rice production, did lead to a relative neglect of other crucial crops, impacting agricultural diversity and nutritional balance.  This focus on a few staple crops had both positive and negative consequences for the agricultural sector and the Indian economy.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The share of agriculture in India's national income has been steadily declining over the past few decades, reflecting the shift towards a more service-based economy.  While agriculture remains important, its relative contribution to GDP has been shrinking.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the \"Make in India\" initiative aimed to boost domestic manufacturing, its impact on GDP has been less dramatic than initially anticipated.  Various factors, including global economic conditions and structural challenges within the Indian manufacturing sector, have limited its overall effectiveness.  The initiative has had a positive impact, but not a substantial increase in GDP contribution.\n"

There are cases where technological advancements or specific policies might allow for some degree of exclusion (e.g., toll roads, pay-per-view television).  The core concept is that exclusion is *difficult or costly*, but not necessarily impossible.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The defining feature of a public good is its non-rivalrous nature.  One person's use doesn't reduce availability for others.\n\nStatement 3 is largely correct. National defense and lighthouse services are often cited as canonical examples of public goods due to their high degree of non-excludability and non-rivalry.  However, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that even these examples might have some limitations (e.g., a crowded lighthouse might slightly reduce the visibility for some). Therefore, statement 3 is more accurate and a better choice than statement 1, which has a greater element of inaccuracy.\n"

As household incomes rise, the demand for kerosene is expected to decrease, reflecting its status as an inferior good.\n2.  A decline in the quality of kerosene over time might be observed due to a shift towards superior substitutes as incomes rise.\n3.

As incomes increase, households are likely to switch to higher-quality, more convenient substitutes for kerosene (e.g., LPG, electricity). This could lead to a perceived decline in kerosene quality as the market shifts away from it.\n\nStatement 3 is a logical policy implication. If demand for kerosene falls due to rising incomes, the efficiency of subsidies on this good diminishes.  The government might reallocate these funds to other areas with greater social impact.  The government might also consider other factors.\n\n"

By requiring banks to hold a specific proportion of their deposits in liquid assets, the RBI influences the amount of money available for lending. This helps to manage inflation and maintain financial stability.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. A rise in the CRR actually *reduces* the money supply.  A higher CRR means banks have to keep a larger portion of their deposits with the RBI, leaving less money available for lending and reducing the money multiplier effect.

FDI represents a long-term investment in a foreign economy, involving significant managerial control and often substantial capital flows.  It's distinct from portfolio investment which involves buying stocks or bonds without managerial control.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the BoP accounts for all international transactions, it doesn't necessarily balance in every period.  There can be temporary imbalances, which are typically financed through changes in foreign exchange reserves or borrowing.  The statement is a common misconception, designed as a distractor.

Darjeeling tea is indeed a GI-protected product, but its protection stems from the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, not the Trade Marks Act, 1999.  While trademarks might offer additional protection for specific brands within the GI, the GI itself is a separate legal entity.\n\n\nTherefore, none of the statements are entirely correct, making (d) the appropriate answer.  The question tests knowledge of the specific legislation governing GIs in India and the nuances of GI protection compared to trademark protection.\n"

Several factors influence trade balances, including global demand, supply-side constraints, and the responsiveness of exports and imports to price changes.  A devaluation may not immediately translate into a better trade balance.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers, thereby increasing their competitiveness in the global market. This is a key objective of devaluation.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.

The WTO's AoA aims to reform and discipline agricultural trade policies, including subsidies, but it does not mandate the complete elimination of all subsidies.  The AoA allows for certain types of domestic support, particularly for developing countries, recognizing the unique challenges faced by their agricultural sectors.  Understanding the nuances of the AoA is crucial for grasping the complexities of international agricultural trade.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The WTO's DSB is a key institution responsible for adjudicating trade disputes between member countries.  Its effectiveness in resolving disputes is a subject of ongoing debate, but its existence is a fundamental feature of the WTO's rules-based trading system.  Knowledge of the DSB's role is essential for understanding the WTO's dispute resolution mechanism.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The WTO was established in 1995, not 1948. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the WTO's predecessor, was established in 1948.  This is a common point of confusion, highlighting the importance of knowing the precise establishment date of the WTO.

While India's GDP growth rate has increased significantly since the 1991 reforms, it did not consistently exceed 8% annually throughout the period.  The growth rate fluctuated considerably, influenced by various internal and external factors.  This highlights the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of economic growth and avoiding generalizations.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Since the commencement of economic reforms, India's service sector has shown consistently higher growth rates compared to its agricultural sector. This shift reflects the structural transformation of the Indian economy, with services becoming a major driver of growth.  This underscores the importance of analyzing sectoral growth patterns to understand the broader economic trends.\n\nStatement 3 is correct.  India's foreign exchange reserves have indeed experienced substantial growth since the 1991 reforms, reflecting increased foreign direct investment, exports, and other inflows. This increase in reserves has enhanced India's economic resilience and strengthened its position in the global financial system.  This is a significant indicator of the success of certain aspects of the economic reforms.

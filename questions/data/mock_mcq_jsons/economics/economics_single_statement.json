Furrow irrigation is a suitable technique for cotton, providing efficient water management. Intercropping with Bajra is also a practiced method in certain areas. Ratooning, however, is a technique primarily associated with sugarcane where the stubble is allowed to regrow, producing a second crop. This is not a standard practice for cotton.

The Eastern Ghats generally receive less rainfall and have different climatic conditions compared to the Western Ghats, leading to the dominance of other forest types.\n\nStatement III is correct. The rain shadow effect of the Western Ghats significantly influences the rainfall patterns in the leeward side (eastward side) of the mountain range, especially in parts of Maharashtra. This reduction in rainfall results in drier conditions and subsequently affects the types of forests that can flourish in these areas.

A lack of standardized curricula (c) affects the quality of practitioners but doesn\u2019t directly prevent treatment.  Insufficient funding (b) is a broad issue affecting many sectors, and while important, it's less directly impactful than the raw material shortage on immediate AYUSH service delivery.

Option (b) is partially true regarding credit direction, but ignores the negative consequences on efficiency.

Horizontal tax devolution aims to distribute tax revenues fairly among states, based on factors that reflect the needs and capabilities of each state.

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct answer is (c) because withdrawing a large sum of cash from demand deposit accounts directly reduces the M1 component of the money supply (demand deposits). However, the impact extends beyond this immediate reduction.  The money multiplier effect comes into play.  Banks maintain a certain reserve ratio (CRR). When cash is withdrawn, the bank's reserves decrease, limiting its ability to create new money through lending.  This contractionary effect on credit creation amplifies the initial decrease caused by the cash withdrawal.  Therefore, the overall effect on the aggregate money supply is a decrease, potentially larger than the amount initially withdrawn. Option (a) is incorrect because it overlooks the money multiplier effect. Option (b) is incorrect as the increased currency in circulation is offset by the reduced demand deposits; the net effect is a contraction, not expansion. Option (d) is incorrect because the withdrawal demonstrably affects the money supply components.  Understanding the money multiplier is crucial for analyzing monetary policy's impact on the economy, a key UPSC theme.\n"

This equalization is achieved by comparing the prices of identical goods and services in different countries, forming a \"basket\" of comparable items.

This is because a portion of the increased demand spills over into imports (M), reducing the impact on domestic output (Y).  The increased demand for imports, without a corresponding increase in exports (X), directly results in a widening trade deficit (NX = X - M).  Option (a) is incorrect because an increase in foreign income (Yf) boosts exports, leading to a larger multiplier and potentially a trade surplus. Option (c) is incorrect as increased domestic savings (S) would generally lead to a reduction in the trade deficit, not an increase. Option (d) is incorrect because exchange rate appreciation makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive, thus worsening the trade balance, but the question is about the impact of *increased* spending, not exchange rate changes.

This allows for a more accurate assessment of economic growth, as it eliminates the distortionary effects of inflation or deflation. Nominal GDP, on the other hand, uses current market prices and therefore reflects both changes in quantity and prices. Potential GDP represents the economy's maximum output if all resources were fully utilized.  Velocity of money indicates how quickly money circulates through the economy.

Net factor income from abroad (NFIA) is a component used to calculate Gross National Product (GNP), not GDP.  GDP focuses solely on economic activity *within* the geographical boundaries of a country.  NFIA accounts for income earned by domestic factors of production in other countries and income earned by foreign factors of production within the country.  Therefore, NFIA is excluded from the GDP calculation using the expenditure method.\n"

This makes (d) the correct answer, as it's a macroeconomic factor influenced by numerous interconnected elements beyond the RBI's direct regulatory power.

FII, conversely, involves purchasing existing shares or securities in the secondary market, without direct control over the company's operations.

A specific dollar amount (adjusted for purchasing power parity) is used as a threshold to classify individuals or households as living in extreme poverty. While other indicators like GDP per capita, poverty headcount ratio, and HDI provide valuable information about poverty and development, GNI per capita is the central metric used by the World Bank to define and measure extreme poverty.\n"

This helps identify potential risks, including financial crises, and encourages member states to adopt sound policies. Option (a) describes a function more closely associated with the World Bank, which focuses on development lending. Option (c) is incorrect because the IMF does not directly regulate the domestic monetary policies of its members; that is the responsibility of each nation's central bank. Option (d) is incorrect as the IMF does not issue its own currency for international transactions; it uses Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as a unit of account, but these are not a freely used currency in the same way as the US dollar or Euro.  The IMF's role in maintaining stability lies primarily in its surveillance, lending conditionalities, and its role in managing the SDR system.\n"

Option (b) is also a credit as it represents earnings from exports. Option (c) represents an inflow of foreign investment, which is a credit.

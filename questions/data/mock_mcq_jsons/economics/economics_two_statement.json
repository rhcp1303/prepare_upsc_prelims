While the government announces MSPs for several major crops,  a significant number of agricultural commodities are not covered under this scheme. The coverage is limited to those crops deemed crucial for food security and farmer welfare.  The selection of crops for MSP is subject to periodic review and adjustments based on various economic and agricultural factors.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is a major player in procuring agricultural commodities at the MSP, primarily focusing on wheat and rice to maintain buffer stocks for the Public Distribution System (PDS). However, the FCI does not have a monopoly on MSP procurement.  Other government agencies and even private players, under specific conditions and agreements, can participate in procuring crops at the announced MSP. The involvement of other agencies ensures wider reach and efficiency in procurement operations.  The assertion that FCI is solely responsible is a significant oversimplification of the complex MSP procurement mechanism.\n"

Monoculture, the practice of cultivating a single crop, is avoided in permaculture because it can lead to vulnerabilities to pests, diseases, and environmental changes.  Conventional chemical farming, on the other hand, often relies heavily on monoculture for efficiency and economies of scale, although this practice is increasingly being questioned.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  Excessive use of chemical fertilizers in conventional farming can contribute to soil salinity, mainly due to the accumulation of salts in the soil profile.  This can lead to soil degradation and reduced crop yields.  Permaculture practices, which focus on soil health and biodiversity, are designed to mitigate such problems.  The emphasis on organic matter and diverse plant cover helps maintain soil balance and prevent salinity build-up."

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The substitution of steel ploughs for wooden ploughs signifies a capital-augmenting technological change.  Steel ploughs are more durable, efficient, and require less maintenance compared to wooden ploughs.  This improvement in the quality of capital (the plough) allows farmers to increase their output with the same amount of labor input.  The enhanced efficiency of the steel plough translates into higher productivity and greater returns on investment, without a significant increase in labor requirements. The focus is on improving the tools (capital) rather than replacing labor entirely.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the steel plough may reduce the physical effort required for ploughing compared to a wooden plough, it doesn't necessarily represent a significant labor-saving technological change. The primary improvement is in the efficiency and productivity of the capital input (the plough itself).  The labor involved in operating the plough is not drastically reduced; the farmer still needs to guide and control the implement.  The main benefit is increased output per unit of labor, not a reduction in the quantity of labor needed.  Therefore, characterizing this change as primarily labor-saving is an oversimplification.  The shift primarily enhances capital productivity.\n"

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. Green manure involves incorporating plant matter into the soil while it is still green or relatively fresh. As this organic matter decomposes, it releases essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, enriching the soil. The improved soil structure also enhances water retention and aeration, creating a more favorable environment for plant growth.  The effectiveness of green manure depends on the type of plant used, soil conditions, and climate.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Organic farming emphasizes sustainable practices that minimize environmental impact. Green manure is a core component of many organic farming systems as it provides a natural source of nutrients, improves soil health, and reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers.  The use of green manure is part of a broader strategy for soil fertility management that also includes crop rotation, cover cropping, and composting.\n\n"

Verghese Kurien's innovative three-tier cooperative model, starting with Amul, successfully integrated milk producers at the village level, district unions, and state federations.  This structure ensured fair prices for farmers, efficient processing and marketing of milk products, and significantly boosted milk production, transforming India into the world's largest milk producer.  The success of this model highlights the potential of cooperative structures in improving rural incomes and livelihoods. The model's replication across the country through Operation Flood further solidified its impact.\n\nStatement 2 is also accurate. The 1991 economic liberalization policies in India, aimed at opening up the economy to global markets, had a profound impact on the growth rates of different sectors. While the non-agricultural sector experienced a substantial acceleration in growth, exceeding 8% in many periods, the agricultural sector's growth remained comparatively stagnant, fluctuating around a long-term trend of 3%. This divergence emphasizes the challenges faced by the agricultural sector in adapting to market reforms and the need for targeted interventions to boost its productivity and growth.  The lack of similar market-oriented reforms in agriculture is cited as the reason for its lagging performance compared to the non-agricultural sector.\n"

While India is a major producer and exporter of several agricultural products, its share in global agricultural exports is not significantly higher than its share in global agricultural production.  India's share in world agricultural exports is relatively modest compared to its large agricultural output and population. This disparity stems from several factors, including limitations in value addition, inadequate infrastructure, and trade policy inconsistencies.  Therefore, the statement overstates India's position in global agricultural trade.\n\nStatement 2 accurately reflects a key aspect of the Agriculture Export Policy 2018. The policy recognizes that the competitiveness of Indian agricultural exports hinges on efficient logistics and robust infrastructure.  The high logistics costs in India (14-15% of export costs, significantly higher than developed economies) highlight the need for improvements.  The policy's focus on pre- and post-harvest handling, storage, processing, road networks, and streamlined port procedures aims to reduce these costs and make Indian agricultural products more competitive in the global market. The emphasis on creating strategically important clusters and improving customs clearance for perishable goods reflects a practical approach to enhancing the export potential of the agricultural sector.\n"

On-the-job training, enhancing skills and productivity within specific industries, also significantly contributes to human capital formation.  Therefore, the statement presents an overly simplistic and incomplete view of the factors influencing human capital.\n\nStatement 2 correctly identifies a key driver of rural-urban migration in India.  The significant difference in per-worker productivity between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors creates an incentive for individuals to migrate from rural areas to urban centers seeking higher-paying jobs. This migration, despite its associated costs, contributes to human capital formation by reallocating labor resources to more productive sectors, ultimately boosting economic growth. The movement of skilled labor to sectors with higher productivity enhances the overall efficiency of the economy.  Unemployment in rural areas further fuels this migration.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nBoth statements accurately identify important sources of growth in Indian agriculture. Statement 1 correctly points out that improving livestock productivity is a critical component of agricultural growth.  Mixed farming systems, where livestock production is integrated with crop cultivation, enhance resource use efficiency.  The growing demand for livestock products, as reflected in their increasing share of consumption expenditure, underscores the importance of improving this sector's productivity to meet this demand and increase farmers' incomes.  Statement 2 is also correct as diversification into high-value crops (HVCs) represents a significant opportunity for increasing farmers' income. HVCs often command higher prices in the market and have higher output values per unit of land compared to staple crops like cereals and pulses.  Shifting towards HVCs can significantly improve the profitability of farming and enhance farmers' livelihoods.  Therefore, both statements are valid and represent crucial strategies for boosting agricultural growth and farmers' incomes.\n"

Statement 1 correctly states that NABARD, established in 1982, acts as an apex institution coordinating rural credit operations. Its primary goal is to ensure the efficient and equitable flow of credit to rural areas at reasonable interest rates. This coordination is crucial as multiple agencies, including commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs), and cooperatives, are involved in rural credit disbursement. Statement 2 is also correct in highlighting the increased importance of NABARD after the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution's increased demand for credit for inputs like HYV seeds and fertilizers led to a shift in NABARD's focus towards production-oriented lending.  This involved providing credit not just for consumption but also for investment in agricultural improvements.  The expansion of credit facilities was instrumental in supporting agricultural growth and diversification.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect NABARD's significant contribution to the development of Indian agriculture.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is largely correct. Expansionary monetary policies, involving actions such as lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply, can stimulate aggregate demand. If this increased demand outpaces the economy's capacity to produce goods and services, it can lead to demand-pull inflation \u2013 a situation where prices rise due to excess demand.  However, the extent to which this happens depends on multiple factors, including the state of the economy, the responsiveness of the economy to monetary policy, and other policy actions.  It's not an absolute guarantee that expansionary policies will always result in demand-pull inflation.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates generally act to *curb* demand-pull inflation, not contribute to it. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, reducing investment and consumption, thereby cooling down aggregate demand and easing inflationary pressures.  They are a common tool used by central banks (including the RBI) to combat inflation."

The statement's emphasis on \"minimal government intervention\" is a simplification, but it accurately reflects the core purpose and dominant application of the Automatic Route.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. FDI, in fact, *reduces* India's current account deficit.  FDI brings in foreign currency, directly contributing to the inflow of funds.  This inflow helps to offset the outflow of currency associated with imports, thus improving the current account balance.  A persistent current account deficit is often associated with a reliance on imports exceeding exports and a shortfall in capital inflows, neither of which is directly caused by FDI.

The short maturity period (typically up to 270 days) makes it a liquid instrument.  The unsecured nature means it doesn't involve collateral, making it suitable for creditworthy borrowers.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are instruments used by corporations to raise funds, they are not exclusively issued by the RBI.  CDs are issued by banks (Scheduled Commercial Banks and some other eligible institutions) to raise short-term deposits from individuals and corporations.  They are typically short to medium-term instruments, not long-term ones.  The RBI does not issue CDs directly.\n"

The statement underestimates the overall market impact of MSPs.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The government's stockpiling of rice, primarily undertaken by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), plays a major role in influencing market prices.  When the FCI procures rice at the MSP, it removes a significant quantity from the open market. This reduced supply can lead to higher prices in the market. Conversely, releasing rice from its stocks can help stabilize or lower prices.  Government stockpiling is a key instrument in managing food security and price stability, especially for essential commodities like rice.\n"

Therefore, easing ECB conditions is not a typical measure to support the Rupee.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. A contractionary monetary policy, involving measures like increasing interest rates, is a common strategy to support a weakening currency. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, as investors seek higher returns on their investments. This increased foreign investment increases demand for the Rupee, helping to strengthen it.  This is a well-established policy tool used by central banks globally to manage exchange rates.  The higher interest rates also help curb inflation which is another factor that can affect the exchange rate."

When the CRR is raised, banks are required to hold a larger portion of their deposits as reserves with the RBI, reducing the amount available for lending.

Open market operations (OMOs), involving the buying and selling of government securities by the RBI, are a key tool for managing liquidity in the banking system.  When the RBI purchases securities, it injects liquidity into the system, increasing money supply; conversely, selling securities withdraws liquidity, contracting money supply.  OMOs are used to fine-tune the money supply and influence interest rates.\n"

Expansionary monetary policies, such as reducing interest rates or increasing the money supply, can stimulate aggregate demand, potentially leading to demand-pull inflation if the increase in demand is not met by a corresponding increase in supply.  This is a classic Keynesian explanation of inflation.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates generally have a *contractionary* effect on the economy. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs, reducing investment and consumption, thereby dampening aggregate demand.  This counteracts demand-pull inflation.  Rising interest rates are often used by central banks as a tool to control inflation.\n"

This increased demand, if the economy is operating near its full capacity, can put upward pressure on prices, resulting in demand-pull inflation.  The magnitude of the inflationary impact depends on various factors like the size of the spending increase, the economy's existing productive capacity, and the responsiveness of prices to changes in demand.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Fiscal policy uses government spending and taxation to influence the economy.  Changes in tax rates directly impact disposable income and business investment.  Lowering tax rates can stimulate consumption and investment, boosting aggregate demand, while raising taxes can have the opposite effect. However, the effectiveness of these adjustments isn't guaranteed.  Consumer and business behavior might not respond predictably to tax changes (e.g., consumers might save increased disposable income rather than spending it).  Furthermore, there are often time lags between policy implementation and its impact on the economy, making precise fine-tuning challenging. The impact of fiscal policy is also affected by the prevailing state of the economy (e.g., during a recession, fiscal stimulus may be more effective).

When the government pursues expansionary fiscal policy (increased spending or tax cuts), it typically increases its borrowing to finance the deficit.

Higher interest rates can then counteract the stimulative effects of monetary policy, which often aims to lower interest rates to encourage investment and economic growth.  The extent of this interaction depends on the size of the fiscal deficit and the overall capacity of the financial markets to absorb the increased borrowing.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  Contractionary fiscal policy (reduced government spending or increased taxes) directly reduces aggregate demand. This complements a contractionary monetary policy (e.g., raising interest rates) aimed at controlling inflation.

The existing private banks were perceived as biased towards large firms and trade, leading to the government's intervention to promote inclusive growth.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The 1969 nationalization of 14 major banks was a landmark event aimed at directing credit towards priority sectors.  However, the subsequent policies, while achieving increased reach, also resulted in inefficiencies.  The stringent regulatory measures like high CRR and SLR, along with administered interest rates and directed lending, stifled competition and reduced the incentives for efficient bank operations. This led to a decline in profitability and overall soundness of the banking system in the following decades.  The focus on social objectives, while laudable, inadvertently created structural issues within the banking sector.\n"

While the Presidency banks and the subsequent introduction of limited liability did lead to the entry of private and foreign banks, it's inaccurate to say foreign banks *dominated* the sector until independence.  Indian banks, both private and joint-stock, existed and played a significant role alongside foreign banks. The Indian banking landscape was diverse, and the relative dominance shifted over time.  The assertion of complete foreign dominance is a simplification of a complex historical reality.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The policy of social control, implemented *before* the 1969 nationalization, aimed to influence the management and credit distribution of commercial banks to achieve social objectives.  It did *not* aim to improve efficiency and profitability through competition and market-driven interest rates. In fact, it reinforced government control and direction over the banking sector, which later contributed to inefficiencies.  The social control policy was a precursor to the more drastic step of nationalization, which sought to achieve similar, albeit more direct, social goals.\n"

The second wave of bank nationalization in 1980, encompassing six more banks, was primarily driven by the need to further expand the reach of priority sector lending to rural areas and to address the growing fiscal deficit faced by the government.\n2. The sharp increase in CRR and SLR from 1960 to 1991, while intended to enhance government control over bank funds, ultimately contributed to the unprofitability and inefficiency of the Indian banking system by limiting banks' lending flexibility and autonomy.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The second phase of nationalization in 1980 aimed to increase the public sector's control over the banking system. This was driven by several factors, including the desire to ensure that priority sector lending reached a wider population, particularly in rural areas.  The increasing government fiscal deficit also played a role, as nationalized banks became a significant source of funds for government borrowing. The expansion of the public sector's share of deposits to 92% reflected this objective of tighter government control.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The significant increase in CRR and SLR between 1960 and 1991 was a policy tool used by the government to control the flow of funds within the banking system.  This resulted in a substantial portion of bank funds being channeled towards government securities and reserves, limiting their availability for commercial lending and investment. This reduced banks' flexibility and profitability, contributing to the overall inefficiency and unprofitability of the Indian banking system before the 1991 reforms.  The rigid regulatory environment created disincentives for efficient management and risk assessment.\n"

The government imposed strict CRR and SLR requirements, forcing banks to hold a substantial portion of their funds in government securities.  This, combined with directed lending to priority sectors at administered, often below-market, interest rates, significantly limited banks' ability to operate efficiently and profitably. The lack of competition further exacerbated the situation, as banks lacked the incentive to innovate or improve their services.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While a high capital-output ratio can indeed hinder economic growth, its direct impact on bank profitability is not as straightforward as suggested. The capital-output ratio reflects the relationship between investment and output in the broader economy. While a high capital-output ratio might indicate inefficiency in the overall economy, it does not directly determine the profitability of individual banks. Bank profitability is more directly affected by factors like lending rates, deposit rates, non-performing assets, and operating costs, all of which were significantly impacted by government regulations in the pre-1991 era.

It restricts such borrowing except in specific situations, such as temporary advances to meet short-term cash flow mismatches between government receipts and disbursements.  This exception acknowledges that there might be unforeseen circumstances requiring short-term borrowing from the RBI, but it emphasizes the importance of minimizing such reliance to maintain monetary policy independence and prevent inflationary pressures from excessive money creation.  The act aims to promote fiscal prudence but allows for flexibility in exceptional cases."

It highlights the crucial point that a revenue deficit signifies the government's inability to finance its current spending (revenue expenditure) from its current income (revenue receipts). This necessitates borrowing, which increases the government's debt burden and potentially crowds out private investment.  The consequences of persistent revenue deficits include reduced capital expenditure and welfare spending, impacting long-term growth and social well-being.\n\nStatement 2 correctly describes fiscal consolidation policies. These policies are designed to improve the government's fiscal health by reducing its deficit.  This involves a combination of expenditure control (reducing wasteful spending and improving efficiency) and revenue enhancement (increasing tax collection through better compliance and broadening the tax base).  The ultimate goal is to achieve a sustainable fiscal position, reflected in a lower fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio, promoting macroeconomic stability.\n"

While excessive government spending in a fully employed economy can be inflationary, strategic government spending during economic downturns can stimulate demand and boost economic activity.  Counter-cyclical fiscal policy is designed to stabilize the economy by increasing government spending during recessions and decreasing it during booms. Even if this leads to higher fiscal deficits in the short term, it can be a necessary tool for economic recovery and preventing deeper recessions.  The effectiveness of counter-cyclical fiscal policy depends on factors like the size of the multiplier effect and the responsiveness of the private sector to changes in government spending."

The National Forest Policy of 1988, while acknowledging the need for timber production,  broadly aims at environmental conservation, maintaining ecological balance, and ensuring the sustainable use of forest resources. Its focus is not solely on maximizing timber production. The policy emphasizes the multiple benefits of forests, including biodiversity conservation, watershed management, and the provision of livelihoods for forest-dependent communities.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  CAMPA's primary mandate is to manage and utilize funds collected as compensation for forest land diverted for non-forestry purposes.  A significant portion of these funds is allocated to afforestation and other compensatory measures in areas affected by such diversions, including mining.  While CAMPA supports broader environmental goals, its core function is linked directly to compensating for forest loss due to developmental activities.  Therefore, statement 2 accurately reflects a key aspect of CAMPA's work.\n"

This reflected a growing recognition of the efficiency gains achievable through market-based solutions.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Planning Commission, a key institution in India's post-independence development, initially adopted a predominantly imperative planning approach.  This involved setting ambitious targets for various sectors, allocating resources based on central planning priorities, and employing significant government intervention in the economy.  This approach was largely based on the socialist ideals prevalent at the time and sought to direct the country's resources towards rapid industrialization and social progress.

Furthermore, persistent deficits can fuel inflation, eroding the purchasing power of individuals and negatively impacting real income growth. The government's focus on deficit reduction is thus crucial for sustainable economic growth and improved living standards.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. While high rates of capital formation are generally viewed as essential for economic expansion, their positive impact on per capita income is contingent on population growth. If the rate of population growth surpasses the rate of capital formation, the increase in overall wealth may not translate into a commensurate improvement in per capita income. This highlights the importance of considering both economic and demographic factors when assessing a nation's development trajectory.

The absence of reliable data from this sector leads to underestimation of the true national income. This is a persistent problem for India's statistical agencies.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. Underemployment is a significant feature of the Indian economy, particularly in the rural agricultural sector.  Many individuals may be technically employed but work only part-time or at a level far below their capacity.  This underutilization of labor resources leads to a lower overall output and, consequently, an underestimation of national income.

The economy's supply-side constraints, such as resource limitations and technological capabilities, play a crucial role in determining the actual growth rate.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Demand-pull inflation is a classic macroeconomic phenomenon where sustained increases in aggregate demand, without corresponding increases in aggregate supply, lead to a rise in the general price level.  When demand exceeds supply, businesses respond by raising prices to maximize profits, resulting in inflation. This type of inflation is often associated with periods of rapid economic expansion where demand outpaces supply."

While there might have been fluctuations, there was no enormous increase in the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP. The economic liberalization policies focused on promoting industrialization and the services sector, leading to a relative decrease in the share of agriculture in the overall GDP.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. India's foreign exchange reserves have significantly increased since 1991. This is attributable to several factors, including increased foreign direct investment (FDI), remittances from overseas Indians, and export growth.  The economic reforms of 1991 created a more favorable environment for foreign capital inflow, contributing to the substantial growth in foreign exchange reserves.  The increase in reserves strengthened India's economic position and provided a buffer against external shocks.\n"

The Act allows for different minimum wages to be fixed for different sectors and regions based on factors like the cost of living and the nature of work.  This is a key difference from the concept of a 'floor wage'.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While the Minimum Wages Act aims to protect workers, its coverage is not entirely comprehensive.  While it covers many categories of workers,  the extent of coverage for agricultural laborers and domestic workers has historically been limited and inconsistent across states. The Act, as initially enacted, partially covered domestic workers, leaving extensive gaps in protection.  The Code on Wages aims to address these limitations, but the 1948 Act itself had significant shortcomings."

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  The trend of increasing casualization of labour in India is a significant concern.  Casual workers lack job security, regular income, and social security benefits such as health insurance, provident fund, and retirement pensions.  This vulnerability makes them susceptible to exploitation and economic hardship.  The growth of the informal economy has contributed to this trend.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the formal sector does offer certain benefits like social security and job security, the informal sector employs a vastly larger share of the Indian workforce. The vast majority of Indians are employed in the informal sector,  including farmers, agricultural labourers, small business owners, and self-employed individuals, who lack formal employment contracts and benefits. The informal sector's size is a major characteristic of the Indian economy."

The RBI's monetary policy actions, including changes in key policy rates, directly impact government bond yields.  When the RBI increases interest rates, bond yields tend to rise, and vice-versa.

Monetary policy tools like repo rate and reverse repo rate directly affect the availability of funds in the banking system, which in turn impacts the liquidity of assets held by banks and other financial institutions.

The IMF's quota system, which influences SDR allocation, considers various economic indicators, including GDP, international reserves, and trade patterns.  The formula is complex and aims to reflect a country's relative importance in the global economy.  A larger quota translates into a larger share of SDRs, but the formula isn't simply proportional to GDP.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The IMF's mandate extends beyond providing loans for balance of payments difficulties. It also provides technical assistance and capacity building to member countries to improve their macroeconomic management, financial sector regulation, and other economic policies. These programs aim to enhance a country's ability to manage its economy sustainably and prevent future crises.  The IMF's role is multifaceted, encompassing both financial assistance and policy advice.\n"

A high level of reserves provides a buffer against exchange rate volatility, but it doesn't dictate the direction of the exchange rate. A central bank may choose to intervene in the foreign exchange market to manage the exchange rate, even with high reserves.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The majority of India's foreign exchange reserves are held in US dollars because of the dollar's role as the dominant global reserve currency.

Factors like increased government spending or consumer confidence can contribute to demand-pull inflation.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Cost-push inflation arises from *increases* in the costs of production, such as wages, raw materials, or energy. These increased costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, even if aggregate demand remains relatively stable.

This financing typically comes from net capital inflows (a capital account surplus).  This is a fundamental principle of BoP accounting.  Without changes in official reserves, any current account imbalance must be matched by an opposite movement in the capital account.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Autonomous transactions are those driven by private market forces (e.g., trade based on comparative advantage, private investment decisions) and are independent of the BoP situation.  Government interventions are considered accommodating transactions, designed to offset imbalances created by autonomous flows.

When a central bank buys government securities, it injects money into the banking system, increasing liquidity and expanding the money supply. Conversely, selling securities withdraws money from the system, reducing liquidity and contracting the money supply.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Increasing the repo rate has a *contractionary* effect on the money supply. A higher repo rate makes borrowing more expensive for commercial banks, discouraging them from borrowing from the central bank and reducing their lending capacity.  This leads to a reduction in the overall money supply in the economy.  It's a tool used to control inflation by making credit more expensive.\n"

The Supreme Court does have original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States, or between States inter se, under Article 131.

Therefore, while the statement isn't entirely false, it's not completely accurate.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction, while extensive, does encompass appeals from tribunals under Article 136 (Special Leave to Appeal). This allows the Supreme Court to review decisions from various courts and tribunals across India, providing a mechanism for final adjudication.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Article 143 of the Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court's advisory opinion on questions of law or fact of public importance.  This advisory jurisdiction is an important part of the Supreme Court's role in the Indian constitutional framework.  The Supreme Court's opinion, however, is not binding on the President.\n"

While the Government of India Act, 1935, served as a significant influence on the drafting of the Indian Constitution, the framers made substantial changes and deviations to create a unique federal structure suited to India's specific needs and context.  The Indian federal system is a blend of elements from various sources, not a mere replication of the 1935 Act. Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court of India has original jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes between the Union and States, providing a crucial mechanism for resolving intergovernmental conflicts and ensuring the smooth functioning of the federal system.\n"

The Court held that the basic structure of the Constitution, including fundamental rights, cannot be altered or amended through the Ninth Schedule.  This significantly limits the scope of the Ninth Schedule's protective power.\n\nStatement 3 is correct because the very purpose of the Ninth Schedule \u2013 to protect laws from judicial review \u2013 raises concerns about the potential infringement on fundamental rights.  Several laws included in the Ninth Schedule have been challenged in court for violating fundamental rights, leading to debates on the balance between legislative will and judicial protection of rights.

This safeguards the core principles of individual rights from easy alteration.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court, through the doctrine of basic structure, has the power to review constitutional amendments.  This ensures that no amendment can alter the fundamental principles of the Constitution. The landmark Kesavananda Bharati case established this principle.\n"

The power is subject to the constraints imposed by the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.  Laws concerning citizenship must not violate these fundamental rights.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Constitution does provide a framework for citizenship, but it also grants Parliament the power to make further provisions. This indicates that the Constitution doesn't lay down exhaustive processes, leaving room for legislative action based on evolving circumstances and societal needs.

Acharya Narendra Dev's leadership in educational institutions and his outspoken opposition to World War II are also historically verifiable.  His involvement in the socialist movement and his close association with figures like Jayaprakash Narayan further solidify his importance in shaping Indian political thought.

In contrast, the Indian Parliament's legislative power is constrained by the written Constitution, which acts as the supreme law of the land.  The federal structure further limits the Parliament's jurisdiction over certain matters reserved for the states.  Judicial review and fundamental rights also act as checks on the Parliament's power, ensuring that legislation does not violate constitutional principles.\n\nStatement 2 correctly identifies the difference in the requirement for the Prime Minister's membership in Parliament.

India, however, allows the Prime Minister to be a member of either the Lok Sabha (Lower House) or the Rajya Sabha (Upper House).\n\nStatement 3 accurately describes the \"shadow cabinet\" as a unique feature of the British system.

The Supreme Court has established the doctrine of basic structure, which limits the Parliament's power to amend those fundamental features that define the essence of the Constitution.

The impeachment process mirrors that for Supreme Court judges, signifying the high level of independence afforded to the position.\n\nStatement 2 is also accurate in highlighting the safeguards ensuring the CAG's independence.  The security of tenure prevents arbitrary dismissal, and the rigorous removal process reinforces their impartiality.  This independence is crucial for the CAG to effectively perform their auditing functions without fear or favor.\n\nStatement 3 correctly describes the CAG's broad auditing responsibilities. While the primary focus is on Union and State government accounts, the CAG's authority extends to other bodies as determined by Parliament. This allows for comprehensive financial oversight across various sectors and organizations.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d), as all three statements are true.\n"

The President can also impose President's Rule if the constitutional machinery in the state has broken down, even without a formal vote of no confidence.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while the final decision rests with the President, the Governor's report is crucial and forms the basis for the President's action.  The President usually consults with the Governor before issuing a proclamation. Statement 3 is incorrect because the dissolution of the state legislative assembly is not automatic. While it often happens, the President has the discretion to keep the assembly intact, especially if they believe the situation can be rectified without dissolution. The Supreme Court's ruling in the S.R. Bommai case (1994) significantly clarified the conditions for imposing Article 356, emphasizing the need for due process and evidence of a breakdown of constitutional machinery, rather than just political disagreements.\n"

The power of judicial review, though fundamental to the Supreme Court's function, is not explicitly mentioned in the Preamble.  It is derived from the Constitution's overall structure and the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court does not have the power to initiate constitutional amendments.  That power rests solely with Parliament, following the procedures laid out in Article 368.  The Supreme Court can only interpret and adjudicate on the constitutionality of existing laws and amendments."

This continuous presence ensures that legislative processes are not disrupted by frequent elections and allows for long-term policy-making. The Lok Sabha, on the other hand, is subject to dissolution at the discretion of the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The maximum representation of Union Territories in the Lok Sabha is not 25 but is 20. This number is not fixed and is determined by Parliament based on the population of the Union Territories.  The representation is significantly less than that of states due to their smaller populations.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Vice-President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.  The Deputy Chairman, however, is elected from amongst the members of the Rajya Sabha itself by the House.  This ensures that the Deputy Chairman is someone with experience and understanding of the Rajya Sabha's functioning.\n\n"

Statement 2 is correct; the Act does establish District Planning Committees for rural development planning. Statement 3 is incorrect; the power of Gram Sabhas to prevent land alienation is primarily from the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, not the 73rd Amendment.

Article 265 doesn't explicitly define the types of taxes.  The specific powers to levy taxes are distributed between the Union and the States under Article 265 and further detailed in the Seventh Schedule (Union, State, and Concurrent Lists).

The Supreme Court, through various judgments, particularly the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), has established the doctrine of basic structure, which limits the extent to which Parliament can amend the Constitution.  Certain fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be altered or destroyed through amendments.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  While Parliament has exclusive legislative power over subjects in the Union List,  it cannot legislate on subjects in the Concurrent List without considering the existing state legislation.  In case of conflict, Parliament's law prevails. The concurrent list allows for both the Centre and the States to legislate on specific subjects.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Article 249 allows the Rajya Sabha to resolve a deadlock between houses by authorizing the Parliament to legislate on State List matters.  This power is specifically invoked during a National Emergency, enabling the Centre to assume control over areas normally under the purview of State Legislatures. This is a crucial aspect of the Indian federal system's flexibility in times of crisis.\n"

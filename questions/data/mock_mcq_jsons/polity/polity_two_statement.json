The Basic Structure doctrine is a judicial creation, not a constitutional definition."

The Indian Treasure and Trove Act, 1878, and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904, predate the Constitution. Their continued existence and operation post-1950 are subject to the Constitution's overarching authority, meaning they are not unconstitutional, but their existence isn't directly mandated by the Constitution.

The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is not confined to constitutional matters alone; it also encompasses other legal disputes as specified in Article 131.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is significantly broader than just constitutional interpretations.  It hears appeals from High Courts on a wide range of legal matters, including civil, criminal, and constitutional issues.  Article 136 grants the Supreme Court the power to grant special leave to appeal in any case, further expanding its appellate reach beyond the limitations suggested in statement 2. The Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is a crucial mechanism for ensuring consistency and uniformity in the application of law across India.\n"

The basic structure doctrine is a judicially created limitation on the amending power of the Parliament.

The \"rarest of rare\" principle is not a mere formality. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the death penalty should be reserved for exceptional cases involving extreme heinousness,  where the gravity of the crime and the circumstances warrant such a severe punishment.

The Act aims to promote decentralization but recognizes the diverse needs of different regions.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The 74th Amendment Act specifically details the establishment of three types of urban local bodies: Nagar Panchayats (for transitional areas), Municipal Councils (for smaller urban areas), and Municipal Corporations (for larger urban areas).

They represent the nation's commitment to social justice, equality, and welfare, influencing the government's legislative and executive actions, even if not directly enforceable through judicial means.  The courts do consider DPSPs while interpreting other provisions.\n"

The Indian Constitution meticulously divides powers between the Union and State governments through three lists: the Union List (subjects under the Union's exclusive jurisdiction), the State List (subjects under the states' jurisdiction), and the Concurrent List (subjects where both Union and States can legislate). This division of powers is a fundamental aspect of the Indian federal system, although the reality is often more nuanced than the strict division suggests.

This promotes national unity and integration by emphasizing a shared national identity. The single citizenship system strengthens the central government's authority and prevents the emergence of conflicting loyalties. This is a key difference that highlights the unique character of the Indian federal system.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Both the Indian and American Constitutions utilize a three-list system to distribute legislative powers between the central and state governments.  This system, while structurally similar, operates with different principles and interpretations in both countries. The allocation of powers in the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List in India is designed to accommodate the country's diverse regional needs and aspirations.  The similarity in structure, however, belies fundamental differences in the balance of power between the central and state governments in the two federations.  A detailed comparison of the three lists in both constitutions would reveal these differences.\n"

The impeachment process of the President, outlined in Article 61 of the Indian Constitution, requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament.  However, the wording \"only\" is slightly imprecise as the exact wording of the resolution is not explicitly defined, allowing for flexibility in phrasing. The essential requirement is the two-thirds majority in each House.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the impeachment process is triggered by violation of the Constitution,  Article 61 doesn't explicitly list *all* possible grounds.  The Constitution leaves room for the Parliament to interpret what constitutes a \"violation\" broad enough to encompass various acts of misconduct or betrayal of the constitutional mandate, even if not explicitly mentioned.  The scope is deliberately broad to allow for future unforeseen circumstances.  The Parliament's interpretation of a \"violation\" is not subject to judicial review, further reinforcing the legislative discretion in this matter.

Dyarchy, a system of dual government with executive power divided between elected ministers and appointed officials, was a feature of the earlier Government of India Act, 1919, but was not retained in the 1935 Act. At the central level, there was no dyarchy. The central government remained under the control of the British.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The 1935 Act is considered a landmark piece of legislation because it established an All-India Federation, bringing together British India and the princely states under a single federal framework. This federal scheme, although ultimately incomplete and imperfect in its implementation, served as a crucial model for the federal structure adopted in the Indian Constitution. The Indian Constitution borrowed several features from the 1935 Act.\n"

The Indian Constitution, while exhibiting features of federalism such as a written constitution, division of powers, and an independent judiciary, deviates from the classic federal model in its allocation of residuary powers.  Unlike the U.S. system, where powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved for the states, India's Constitution assigns residuary powers to the Union government. This strengthens the central government's authority and is a significant point of departure from a purely symmetrical federal structure. This concentration of power at the center is often cited as a key characteristic differentiating the Indian federal system from other federal models.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct.  India's federal structure operates under a system of single citizenship.  This means that all individuals residing within the country are Indian citizens, irrespective of the state they inhabit.  This is in contrast to systems like the U.S. where individuals hold both a national citizenship and a citizenship of the specific state in which they reside. The single citizenship provision in India promotes national unity and avoids the complications that dual citizenship might entail within a diverse federal system.

Another prominent unitary feature of the Indian Constitution is the establishment of an integrated judicial system. This system is headed by the Supreme Court at the highest level and includes the High Courts at the state level.  This single judicial system enforces both Central and State laws. Unlike some other federal systems, such as the United States, India does not have separate judicial systems at the Union and State levels. This integrated structure, while promoting uniformity in legal interpretation, can also be seen as potentially limiting the autonomy of state judiciaries in interpreting and applying state-specific laws.

The decision to dissolve the assembly is at the discretion of the President, and not a mandatory consequence of the imposition of President's Rule.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The imposition of President's Rule invariably leads to the removal of the existing Council of Ministers in the State. The Council of Ministers becomes responsible to the Governor during President's Rule and ceases to function, making the removal a necessary step in the process. The Governor, as the agent of the President, assumes the executive authority of the state, and this necessitates the dismissal of the existing state government.\n"

Local social activists can be involved in these processes, leveraging their understanding of local customs and social dynamics to facilitate amicable settlements.  This approach complements the formal judicial process, promoting faster and less adversarial dispute resolution.  The involvement of local activists is crucial in enhancing the effectiveness of the Act."

This has led to ongoing debates and legal challenges concerning the interpretation and application of the Act.  The lack of a clear constitutional definition and subsequent legislative attempts to address the issue showcase the complexities of balancing democratic representation and potential conflicts of interest.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The S.R. Bommai case (1994) is a landmark judgment that significantly altered the application of Article 356. The Supreme Court laid down strict guidelines for the imposition of President's Rule, requiring a detailed examination of the situation and ensuring that the action is not taken arbitrarily or for purely political reasons. The judgment emphasized that the imposition of President's Rule should be the last resort and must be justified by compelling circumstances. It also strengthened the role of the judiciary in reviewing the President's actions under Article 356, safeguarding the principles of federalism and democratic governance.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  The 38th Amendment Act of 1975, enacted during the Emergency, actually *expanded* the powers of the President under Article 356, giving the executive more discretion and effectively reducing the scope for judicial review. This amendment was seen as a significant curtailment of state autonomy and raised serious concerns about undermining federalism.  The 44th Amendment Act later repealed crucial parts of the 38th Amendment, restoring some of the checks and balances on the use of Article 356.  Therefore, the statement's assertion of strengthening President's Rule power and reducing judicial oversight under the 38th Amendment is incorrect."

The Chief Election Commissioner enjoys a high degree of independence and security of tenure.  While not technically removable through impeachment in the same way as judges of the Supreme Court, the CEC can only be removed from office by the President on the grounds of proven misbehavior or incapacity.  This requires a process of investigation and recommendation, ensuring that the removal is not arbitrary.\n"

PRIs are primarily responsible for local governance, managing various aspects of local development and administration.  They handle tasks such as rural development, infrastructure projects, primary education, public health, and maintaining law and order at the local level.

Land revenue, taxes on agricultural income (though limited), taxes on lands and buildings, taxes on mineral rights, excise duties on alcoholic liquors, taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity, and other taxes and duties contribute significantly to a State's budget.  Public services like pensions are primarily funded from the State's own resources and not solely dependent on central funding.  Disaster relief funds may involve both state and central contributions.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Constitution of India imposes limitations on a State's power to tax agricultural income.  This is a significant constraint as agriculture is a major economic sector in many states.  Conversely, land revenue has traditionally been, and in some states continues to be, a substantial source of state revenue. The collection and management of land revenue are key functions of state governments.\n"

The fund is managed by the President, ensuring a swift and decisive approach to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament does *not* scrutinize the Contingency Fund's utilization. The PAC primarily examines the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on government expenditure.  The Contingency Fund's usage is reviewed by the President and reported to Parliament. This separation ensures a clear line of accountability.  The President's role ensures that the fund is used judiciously and responsibly."

The 100-day guarantee is a minimum;  households may be offered more days of work depending on demand and availability.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. A core objective of MGNREGA is the creation of durable rural infrastructure assets.  While providing employment is the immediate goal, the long-term aim is to improve the rural economy through the development of assets like irrigation works, roads, water conservation structures, and other infrastructure that enhances productivity and livelihoods. This asset creation contributes to long-term rural development and poverty reduction.  The focus on creating durable assets differentiates MGNREGA from purely welfare-oriented employment schemes.\n"

Article 324 of the Constitution mandates that the President shall make available such staff as the Election Commission may require for the exercise of its powers and the discharge of its functions. While the staff may often come from the Central Government pool, the constitutional provision doesn't explicitly restrict the President's choice to only Central Government personnel. The President's discretion in this matter underscores the ECI's independence and autonomy.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. The Election Commission does allocate election symbols to candidates, a crucial aspect of electoral management.  However, the allocation is not solely based on established parties.  The process involves a combination of factors, including the party's registration status (registered vs. unregistered), and the application of the established rules and procedures.  Unregistered parties also have the opportunity to apply for symbols, though their choices might be limited compared to established parties.  Therefore, the statement presents an oversimplification of a more nuanced process.\n"

This ambiguity in the law's application to en-masse defections over multiple instances is a known limitation.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, which forms the basis of the Anti-Defection Law, explicitly applies to members of Parliament and state legislatures.  However, the law doesn't directly address the broader issue of voting patterns in Parliament during crucial votes like no-confidence motions. While such votes might reflect a shift in political alliances, the Anti-Defection Law primarily deals with formal changes in party membership rather than the strategic voting choices of individual members. This difference in scope is a key aspect of understanding the limitations of the Anti-Defection Law.\n\n"

A vote of no confidence can lead to the dismissal of the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers.  The principle of collective responsibility ensures the government's survival hinges on the Assembly's confidence.  This is a cornerstone of the parliamentary system in India.\n\n"

The debate highlighted the complex interplay between democratic governance and the role of judicial oversight in protecting fundamental rights. The differing interpretations and ongoing discussions demonstrate the lasting impact of the 42nd Amendment on Indian constitutional law.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.\n"

The 42nd Amendment Act significantly altered the balance of power between the different branches of the Indian government, leading to lasting debates about its constitutional implications.\n\n**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**",

        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is largely correct, although not entirely precise.  While the 42nd Amendment did aim to limit the scope of judicial review, impacting the Supreme Court's power significantly, it also curtailed the jurisdiction of High Courts.  The amendment's effect on the High Courts' ability to issue writs and perform judicial review was substantial. The focus on the Supreme Court in statement 1 might be a deliberate distractor, playing on the fact that the Supreme Court's position in the judicial hierarchy makes its limitations more impactful.\n\nStatement 2 is entirely correct. The 42nd Amendment's extensive changes to the Constitution, particularly those concerning the balance of power between the legislature, executive, and judiciary, have been a subject of sustained legal and political analysis.  The amendment's impact on fundamental rights, judicial review, and the relationship between the different branches of government is still debated in legal and political spheres. Its long-term consequences for the Indian political system continue to be analyzed and discussed. Therefore, both statements reflect key aspects of the 42nd Amendment.\n"

        "question_text": "With reference to the 42nd Amendment and its impact on the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**\n\n1. The 42nd Amendment added the words \"Socialist\" and \"Secular\" to the Preamble in 1976, reflecting the then-government's socialist and secular policies but did not alter the basic structure doctrine.\n2. The 42nd Amendment, passed amidst the Emergency, significantly altered the power dynamics between the Parliament and the judiciary, sparking extensive debates about its constitutionality.\n\n**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**",
        "option_a": "1 only\n",
        "option_b": "2 only\n",
        "option_c": "Both 1 and 2\n",
        "option_d": "Neither 1 nor 2\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is partially correct.  The 42nd Amendment did indeed add \"Socialist\" and \"Secular\" to the Preamble in 1976. The addition of these words reflected the then-ruling party's ideological stance. However, the statement is misleading by suggesting that the amendment did *not* affect the basic structure doctrine. While the basic structure doctrine wasn't explicitly defined until later (in *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala*), the 42nd Amendment's attempts to restrict judicial review and expand parliamentary powers directly challenged the nascent concept of limitations on amending power, which forms the basis of the basic structure doctrine. The inclusion of this statement as a distractor hinges on the subtle implication that it was unaffected, whereas the amendment did indeed challenge the underlying principles that would later be codified as the basic structure.\n\nStatement 2 is entirely correct. The 42nd Amendment substantially altered the balance of power between the Parliament and the judiciary.  It aimed to limit the power of judicial review, particularly concerning fundamental rights, which was a direct response to the judiciary's role in checking government power. This dramatic shift in power dynamics caused widespread debate amongst legal and political experts. The amendment's far-reaching consequences for the Indian political system are still debated today. The timing of the amendment, during the Emergency, further heightened the controversy surrounding its constitutionality. Thus, both statements capture significant aspects of the 42nd Amendment's impact, even if one contains a carefully crafted misleading element.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) is significantly linked to the development of the \"basic structure doctrine,\" which limits Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  However, the case also saw the Supreme Court utilize the Doctrine of Prospective Overruling. The Minerva Mills case (1980) further solidified the basic structure doctrine.  The Golaknath case (1967) is associated with the Doctrine of Eclipse, dealing with the relationship between fundamental rights and legislation. The invalidation of the NJAC Act in 2014 is a prime example of the Supreme Court's power of judicial review.  Article 32 explicitly grants the Supreme Court the power to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights, a core aspect of its writ jurisdiction.  Option (d) is incorrect because while Golaknath is linked to the Doctrine of Eclipse, its primary focus wasn't solely on this doctrine; other legal concepts were also involved in the judgment.

The other options contain incorrect years.  The Indian Treasure and Trove Act was enacted in 1878, not 1879. The Antiquities (Export Control) Act was enacted in 1947, not 1948. The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Act was enacted in 1958, not 1958.  These discrepancies highlight the importance of precise factual recall in questions related to Indian legal history. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding acts and their respective years of enactment, a crucial skill for understanding the evolution of Indian law.

The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights, transforming it into a legal right under Article 300A.  The 52nd Amendment Act of 1985 introduced the Anti-Defection Law, aiming to curb political defections and enhance the stability of the government. The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 established a three-tier Panchayati Raj system to empower local self-governance at the village, intermediate, and district levels.  Similarly, the 74th Amendment Act of 1992 established a three-tier system of Municipalities for urban local governance.

The supervisory jurisdiction is an inherent power, not tied to one specific article.  Original jurisdiction is supported by Articles 226 and 227 but is not fully defined in a single article.  Similarly, the contempt power stems from its status as a Court of Record, an inherent power.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are definitively and completely matched to their constitutional grounding.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair.\n"

Government of NCT of Delhi directly challenged Section 377 of the IPC, which criminalized homosexual acts. Shreya Singhal v. Union of India concerned the freedom of speech and expression in the context of internet regulation.  The KM Nanavati case, while significant, dealt with the jurisdiction of the courts in a specific criminal case and not with the abolition of Privy Council appeals.  That issue was addressed through constitutional amendments and not a single Supreme Court case.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of the Nanavati case acts as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of landmark Supreme Court judgments.\n"

Certiorari is accurately described as a writ used to bring a case before a higher court for review. Quo Warranto correctly identifies the purpose of inquiring into the legality of holding public office.  Habeas Corpus, however, is not correctly matched with its description.  While it can lead to the review of a detention, its primary purpose is to ensure that a person is not unlawfully detained and to have the person brought before the court.

        "correct_option": "(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5",
        "explanation": "\n\nAll five pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:\n\n1. **Article 32 and Fundamental Rights:** Article 32 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that guarantees the right to constitutional remedies.  This means citizens can directly approach the Supreme Court if their Fundamental Rights are violated. The Supreme Court has the power to issue writs (orders) to protect these rights. This is a cornerstone of the Indian judicial system, ensuring the effectiveness of Fundamental Rights.\n\n2. **Right to Property:** The Right to Property was initially a Fundamental Right under Article 31. However, the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 removed this right from Part III (Fundamental Rights) of the Constitution and made it a legal right under Article 300-A. This change reflects a shift in the government's approach to property rights, emphasizing social and economic justice.\n\n3. **Basic Structure Doctrine and Kesavananda Bharati:** The Basic Structure Doctrine is a crucial legal principle in India.  It emerged from the landmark judgment in *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973). This case established that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution (under Article 368), it cannot alter the basic or essential features of the Constitution.  This doctrine safeguards the fundamental framework of the Indian Constitution.\n\n4. **Article 19(1) and Freedom of Speech:** Article 19(1) of the Constitution guarantees several fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech and expression. This is a vital right in a democracy, allowing citizens to express their opinions freely, participate in public discourse, and hold the government accountable. However, this freedom is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, security, etc.\n\n5. **Fundamental Rights and Statutes:** Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and are considered the most important rights of Indian citizens.  These rights are protected against violation by any law or action that is inconsistent with them. If a statute infringes upon a Fundamental Right, the judiciary can declare it invalid.  This reflects the supremacy of the Constitution and the judiciary's role in upholding the rule of law.\n\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.

It introduced reasonable restrictions on these rights.\n\n2. **1976 - Forty-second Amendment Act:**  This is a landmark amendment often referred to as the \"Mini-Constitution.\" It introduced significant changes, including the addition of \"Socialist,\" \"Secular,\" and \"Integrity\" to the Preamble, reflecting the changing social and political landscape of the time.  It also made several changes to Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.\n\n3. **1978 - Forty-fourth Amendment Act:** This amendment sought to restore some of the balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, which had been altered by the 42nd Amendment.  Significantly, it also removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights.\n\n4. **1985 - Fifty-second Amendment Act:** This amendment introduced the Anti-Defection Law (Tenth Schedule), aiming to curb political defections and enhance the stability of governments. This amendment addressed a major challenge to the functioning of parliamentary democracy.\n\n5. **1992 - Seventy-third and Seventy-fourth Amendment Acts:** These amendments are crucial for local governance in India.

State of Punjab (1980):** This case dealt with the death penalty. The Supreme Court held that the death penalty should only be awarded in the \"rarest of rare\" cases,  introducing a degree of proportionality in capital punishment.  This decision significantly impacted the application of the death penalty, limiting its use to exceptional circumstances.\n\n2.  **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973):** This landmark case introduced the \"Basic Structure Doctrine.\" The court ruled that the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution (Article 368) is not unlimited and that certain fundamental aspects, or the basic structure, of the Constitution cannot be altered.  This significantly limits the scope of Parliament's amending power and enhances the judiciary's role in constitutional interpretation.\n\n3.  **Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980):** This case further reinforced the Basic Structure Doctrine. The court upheld the limits on Parliament's amending power, emphasizing the need to protect the core elements of the Constitution.  This reiterated the judiciary's role in safeguarding the basic structure of the Constitution.\n\n4.  **Golaknath v. State of Punjab (1967):** This case dealt with the scope of Parliament's amending power. The Court held that Parliament could not amend Fundamental Rights.

While Rajya Sabha represents states and union territories, its representation is not strictly proportional to population. It's based on a formula that considers both population and statehood, leading to unequal representation per capita.\n\nPair 3 is correct. The Indian Constitution empowers Parliament to extend the term of State Legislative Assemblies during a National Emergency, a crucial provision during times of national crisis. This exemplifies the federal structure's flexibility and the supremacy of Parliament in such situations.\n\nPair 4 is correct. State Legislative Assemblies typically have a five-year term, a fundamental aspect of their constitutional setup.  This ensures a regular cycle of elections and accountability to the electorate.\n\nPair 5 is correct. The Governor, as the head of the state executive, has the power to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly under specific constitutional provisions, primarily when a government loses its majority support or faces a severe crisis.

However, the Joint Public Service Commission is established through an Act of Parliament, and not a constitutional body. Therefore, only options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched.\n"

The 52nd Amendment introduced the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law) to curb political defections.  The 44th Amendment removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights, transforming it into a legal right under Article 300A.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.

It was a multi-party body.\n    4. It worked through various committees.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(c) 3 and 4 only",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatements 3 and 4 are correct. The Constituent Assembly was a multi-party body, representing various political viewpoints and interests. It functioned effectively through a series of committees, which facilitated the drafting and discussion of the Constitution. Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect; the Assembly was not based on adult suffrage (universal adult franchise was not in place) and its members were indirectly elected through provincial assemblies.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the nature and functioning of the Constituent Assembly, using distractors that represent common misconceptions.\n\n\nThese ten questions provide a comprehensive yet challenging assessment of knowledge related to the Constituent Assembly and related constitutional aspects.  The distractors are carefully constructed to test the candidate\u2019s deep understanding of the subject matter, going beyond simple memorization.\n\n1. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Constitutional Article          Subject Matter\n   1. Article 52                     :  Office of Vice-President\n   2. Article 53                     :  Executive power of the Union\n   3. Article 54                     :  Election of the President\n   4. Article 61                     :  Procedure for impeachment of the President\n\n   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n   (a) 1 only\n   (b) 2 and 3 only\n   (c) 3 and 4 only\n   (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nArticle 52 of the Indian Constitution deals with the President of India, not the Vice-President.  The Vice-President is addressed in Article 66. Article 53 correctly establishes that the executive power of the Union is vested in the President. However, Article 52 defines the office of the President, not the executive power.  Article 54 accurately outlines the election of the President.  Crucially, Article 61 precisely details the procedure for the impeachment of the President. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options include incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of constitutional articles and their specific subject matter.  A comprehensive understanding of the Indian Constitution is crucial for success in the UPSC examination, demanding not just familiarity but also a deep grasp of individual articles and their functions within the broader framework of governance.\n\n\n2. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Constitutional Article             Power or Function\n   1. Article 72                      :  Pardon power of the Governor\n   2. Article 74                      :  Council of Ministers to aid and advise the President\n   3. Article 148                    :  Establishment of the Union Public Service Commission\n   4. Article 280                    :  Appointment of the Election Commission\n\n   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n   (a) 1 only\n   (b) 2 and 3 only\n   (c) 3 only\n   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nArticle 72 correctly describes the President's power of pardon, not the Governor's. The Governor's pardoning power is defined in Article 161. Article 74 accurately states the role of the Council of Ministers in aiding and advising the President. Article 148 correctly pertains to the establishment of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).  Article 280, however, deals with the establishment of the Finance Commission, not the Election Commission which is established by law. The Election Commission of India's formation is not directly mandated by a specific constitutional article but established through legislation.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The incorrect pairings in options (a), (c), and (d) demonstrate the importance of precise knowledge of constitutional provisions for accurate matching. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the Indian Constitution's framework, essential for the UPSC exam.\n\n\n3. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Position                                  Method of Removal\n   1. President of India                     :  Impeachment by Parliament\n   2. Judge of Supreme Court                :  Removal by the President\n   3. Governor of a State                    :  Removal by the President\n   4. Speaker of Lok Sabha                  :  No formal removal mechanism in the Constitution\n\n   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n   (a) 1 and 2 only\n   (b) 1, 2, and 3 only\n   (c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe President of India can be removed through impeachment by Parliament (Article 61), making pair 1 correct. Judges of the Supreme Court can be removed by the President on an address by Parliament (Article 124), thus pair 2 is correct.  Governors of states are also removed by the President (Article 156), making pair 3 correct.  However, while the Speaker of Lok Sabha can be removed through a no-confidence motion, there isn't a specific constitutional provision for their removal. The Speaker's removal is a parliamentary process. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the removal processes of various constitutional office holders, a crucial aspect of Indian governance and a frequent theme in UPSC questions.  The distractors emphasize the need for precise knowledge, avoiding generalizations.\n\n\n4. **With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Schedule                                 Subject Matter\n   1. Second Schedule                         :  Oath of office for the President\n   2. Third Schedule                          :  Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha\n   3. Fourth Schedule                         :  Oath or affirmation by members of Parliament\n   4. Fifth Schedule                          :  Administration of Scheduled Areas\n\n   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n   (a) 1 only\n   (b) 1 and 4 only\n   (c) 3 and 4 only\n   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Second Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with salaries and allowances of various dignitaries, including the President, making pair 1 correct. The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha, not the Third Schedule. The Third Schedule deals with oaths and affirmations. The Fifth Schedule correctly addresses the administration of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes.  The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian Constitution's schedules and their contents, requiring precise factual recall. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.\n\n\n5. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Constitutional Body                   Functions\n   1. Comptroller and Auditor General of India  :  Auditing the accounts of the Union and States\n   2. Union Public Service Commission      :   Conducting recruitment for state-level services\n   3. Finance Commission                     :  Recommending principles governing the distribution of taxes\n   4. National Human Rights Commission     :  Investigating human rights violations\n\n   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n   (a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n   (b) 1 and 3 only\n   (c) 1 and 4 only\n   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India audits the accounts of the Union and States, making pair 1 correct. The UPSC conducts recruitment primarily for All-India Services and certain other central services, not state-level services. State Public Service Commissions handle recruitment for state-level services. The Finance Commission recommends principles for the distribution of tax revenues between the Centre and the States, making pair 3 correct. The National Human Rights Commission investigates human rights violations at the national level. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the functions of key constitutional bodies.  The distractors highlight the importance of distinguishing between the roles and responsibilities of various organizations.\n\n\n6. **With reference to the Indian Parliamentary System, consider the following pairs:**\n\n    Type of Bill                              Legislative Procedure\n    1. Money Bill                               :  Can be introduced only on the recommendation of the President\n    2. Ordinary Bill                             :  Requires the assent of the President for enactment\n    3. Constitutional Amendment Bill          :  Requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament\n    4. Private Member's Bill                   :  Introduced by a Member of Parliament who is not a minister\n\n\n   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n   (a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n   (b) 1, 3, and 4 only\n   (c) 2 and 4 only\n   (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nA Money Bill, as per Article 110, can only be introduced in Parliament on the recommendation of the President.  Ordinary Bills require the President's assent for enactment (Article 111).  Constitutional Amendment Bills need a special majority in both Houses (Article 368). Private Member's Bills are introduced by MPs who are not ministers.  All four pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of different types of bills and their legislative procedures within the Indian Parliament. The inclusion of all correct pairs makes the question challenging, demanding comprehensive knowledge of parliamentary procedures.\n\n\n7. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Constitutional Amendment Act         Key Provision\n   1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act :  Establishment of Panchayats at the village, intermediate and district levels\n   2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act :  Establishment of Municipalities at the three levels\n   3. 91st Constitutional Amendment Act :  Reservation of seats for SCs and STs in proportion to their population\n   4. 52nd Constitutional Amendment Act:  Addition of the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law)\n\n\n   Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n   (a) 1 and 2 only\n   (b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n   (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n   (d) 3 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe 73rd Amendment Act established the three-tier panchayati raj system. The 74th Amendment Act established the three-tier municipal system. The 52nd Amendment Act introduced the Tenth Schedule, dealing with anti-defection. However, the 91st Amendment Act does not directly deal with reservation of seats in the proportion to their population.  It deals with reservation of seats for SCs and STs in local bodies, but not necessarily in direct proportion to their population.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge about specific Constitutional Amendment Acts and their key features, requiring precise factual recall and understanding of the nuances of legislative changes.\n\n\n8. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n    Article                                  Power or Function\n    1. Article 352                               :  Proclamation of Financial Emergency\n    2. Article 356                               :  Proclamation of President's Rule in a State\n    3. Article 360                               :  Proclamation of National Emergency\n    4. Article 365                               :  Failure of a State to comply with the directions of the Union\n\n    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n    (a) 1 only\n    (b) 2 and 4 only\n    (c) 2 only\n    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nArticle 352 deals with the proclamation of a National Emergency, not a Financial Emergency. Article 356 correctly relates to the President's Rule in a state. Article 360 correctly defines the Financial Emergency. Article 365 accurately describes the consequences of a state's failure to comply with Union directives. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution, a critical area for UPSC aspirants. The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.\n\n\n9. **With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**\n\n    Article                                         Provision\n    1. Article 32                                    :  Right to Constitutional Remedies\n    2. Article 370                                   :  Special status for Jammu and Kashmir (now repealed)\n    3. Article 368                                   :  Amendment of the Constitution\n    4. Article 356                                   :  President's Rule in a State\n\n    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n    (a) 1 and 2 only\n    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only\n    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nArticle 32 correctly guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, including the right to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of Fundamental Rights.  Article 370, though now repealed, previously granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 368 correctly outlines the procedure for amending the Constitution.  Article 356 correctly deals with the imposition of President's rule in a state.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of crucial articles of the Indian Constitution and their functions. The inclusion of all correct answers makes this a challenging question, demanding a deep understanding of the Indian constitutional framework.\n\n\n10. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n    Fundamental Right                                    Article\n    1. Right to Equality                                :  Article 17\n    2. Right to Freedom                                 :  Article 20\n    3. Right against Exploitation                         :  Article 24\n    4. Right to Freedom of Religion                       :  Article 25\n\n    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n    (a) 1 and 2 only\n    (b) 3 and 4 only\n    (c) 2 and 3 only\n    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nArticle 17 deals with the abolition of untouchability, not the right to equality, which is covered by Articles 14-18. Article 20 protects against ex-post facto laws and double jeopardy, not the entire right to freedom, which encompasses Articles 19-22. Article 24 correctly prohibits the employment of children in hazardous work. Article 25 correctly guarantees the freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Fundamental Rights and their corresponding articles.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's detailed understanding of the rights guaranteed under Part III of the Indian Constitution."

Finally, Article 323(A) relates to Administrative Tribunals, designed to provide a mechanism for resolving disputes related to government service.  Therefore, only the pair linking Article 148 to the CAG is correctly matched. The other pairs incorrectly associate the articles with different constitutional bodies. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional provisions related to the mentioned entities.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submits its reports to the President, who then lays them before Parliament. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) also submits its annual reports to the Parliament, maintaining its accountability. The Finance Commission, however, does not directly report to the State Legislature. While its recommendations impact State finances, its reports are submitted to the President, who then presents them to Parliament.  The State Legislature may discuss the Commission\u2019s report but does not directly receive it. Thus, only options 2 and 3 accurately reflect the reporting structures of these constitutional bodies. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the accountability mechanisms within the Indian governmental framework, requiring a nuanced understanding of the reporting relationships of different constitutional bodies.\n"

Irish Constitution                         :   Directive Principles of State Policy\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?",

        "correct_option": "(d)",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe Indian Constitution borrowed significantly from various sources. The Government of India Act, 1935, served as a major source for the federal scheme of the Indian Constitution. The British Constitution provided the foundation for the parliamentary system in India.  The US Constitution influenced the incorporation of the concept of judicial review. The Irish Constitution was the source for the Directive Principles of State Policy. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched."

        "explanation": "\n\nThe correct pairs are 2 and 4. The Election Commission of India's Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President of India.  The Finance Commission is also appointed by the President. Option 1 is incorrect because the Chairman and members of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) are appointed by the President, not the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister plays no role in the appointment of UPSC members. Option 3 is incorrect because the Chief Justice of India is the head of the Supreme Court but the Judges themselves are appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice and other Judges. The Chief Justice does not appoint the other judges.  Therefore, only options 2 and 4 represent accurate pairings.  Understanding the appointing authorities for these crucial constitutional bodies is essential for comprehending the Indian governmental structure and the checks and balances within it.  The question tests factual recall about the structure of key constitutional bodies and their relationship with the executive branch.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Government of India Act of 1858 transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British Crown, establishing the office of the Secretary of State for India to oversee Indian administration.  This Secretary of State was a member of the British Cabinet, responsible to the British Parliament.  This is accurately reflected in pair 1.\n\nThe Indian Councils Act of 1861 introduced a limited form of Indian participation in the legislative councils, but did not establish separate electorates. Separate electorates were a feature of the Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms).  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.\n\nThe Indian Councils Act of 1892 did expand the legislative councils, but it *did not* grant non-official majorities in provincial legislative councils.  Official majorities were maintained. Thus, pair 3 is incorrect.\n\nThe Government of India Act of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms) introduced dyarchy, dividing provincial subjects into transferred and reserved categories.  The transferred subjects were administered by ministers responsible to the provincial legislature, while reserved subjects remained under the Governor's control.  This makes pair 4 correct.\n"

The primary aim was to amend Article 31 to safeguard the right to acquire property for public purposes.

This is a strong and accurate match in pair 2.\n\nThe Indian Councils Act of 1909 introduced some reforms but not provincial autonomy or dyarchy. Dyarchy was a feature of the Government of India Act of 1919.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.\n\nThe Regulating Act of 1773 aimed to improve the governance of the East India Company but did not create the Board of Control.

        "explanation": "\n\nAll the pairs are correctly matched.  The Supreme Court extensively uses these legal doctrines in its judgments.\n\n* **Doctrine of Severability:** This doctrine allows courts to strike down only the invalid parts of a law while upholding the remaining valid portions. The Supreme Court frequently employs this to preserve as much of a legislative enactment as possible while ensuring constitutional compliance.\n\n* **Doctrine of Prospective Overruling:** This allows the court to declare a previous judgment incorrect without invalidating the actions taken based on that judgment. This is vital when dealing with significant constitutional changes, allowing for a smooth transition while correcting legal errors. The Supreme Court has used this cautiously, often announcing prospective overruling to provide clarity and avoid chaos in the legal system.\n\n* **Doctrine of Waiver:**  This principle involves a party voluntarily giving up a known right or claim. The Supreme Court considers this in various contexts, including procedural matters, where a party's actions might suggest a waiver of certain rights or objections.\n\n* **Doctrine of Eclipse:** This applies when a pre-constitutional law is inconsistent with a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. The pre-constitutional law is not repealed but is rendered inoperative (eclipsed) to the extent it conflicts with the fundamental right.  The Supreme Court uses this to reconcile older laws with the Constitution's guarantees.\n\n* **Doctrine of Harmonious Construction:** This mandates interpreting multiple laws or conflicting provisions within a single law in a way that harmonizes them, avoiding contradictions. The Supreme Court utilizes this to maintain consistency and coherence within the legal framework.  It avoids rendering laws completely void whenever possible, aiming for a practical and functional legal system.\n"

The amendment attempted to limit the scope of judicial review, aiming to reduce judicial intervention in legislative and executive actions.\n\n* **44th Amendment Act, 1978:** This amendment, enacted after the Emergency, partially reversed the restrictions imposed by the 42nd Amendment. It reinstated some of the Supreme Court's powers of judicial review, restoring a degree of balance between the judiciary and the legislature.  The 44th Amendment aimed to address the concerns raised about the excessive concentration of power in the executive and legislature.\n\n* **99th Constitutional Amendment, 2014:** This amendment introduced the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), aiming to alter the process of appointing judges to the higher judiciary.  However, the Supreme Court, in a landmark judgment, declared the NJAC Act unconstitutional, thereby reaffirming its role in judicial appointments.

The court has often emphasized the importance of these principles in achieving social and economic justice, influencing government policies to align with constitutional ideals.\n\n* **Basic Structure Doctrine:** This doctrine, first articulated in the *Kesavananda Bharati* case, limits the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has defined certain aspects of the Constitution as its \"basic structure,\" which cannot be altered through constitutional amendments.

The court reiterated the importance of maintaining the essential features of the Constitution, preventing any attempts to alter its core values or principles.\n\n* **Golak Nath Case (1967):**  This case initially limited the Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights.  However, this ruling was later overturned by the 24th Amendment.  The Golak Nath case significantly impacted the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary in constitutional amendment matters.\n\n* **Shankari Prasad Case:**  This case initially upheld Parliament's unfettered power to amend fundamental rights.  This decision was later overturned by the Golak Nath case and subsequently modified by the 24th Amendment.  The Shankari Prasad case illustrates the evolving interpretation of the Constitution.

        "explanation": "\n\nThe 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Indian Constitution, including increasing the strength of the Lok Sabha.  This directly impacted Parliament's composition and functioning.  Option 2 is incorrect because the 44th Amendment (1978) primarily aimed at restoring balance between the executive and judiciary, limiting the scope of the President's emergency powers, not directly impacting Parliament\u2019s powers. Options 3 and 4 are also incorrect as the 73rd and 74th Amendments (1992) pertained to Panchayati Raj and Urban Local Bodies respectively, establishing these institutions at the local level and not directly altering Parliament's structure or powers.  These amendments did not directly enhance or diminish Parliament's authority. Thus, only statement 1 accurately reflects a direct impact on Parliament resulting from a constitutional amendment.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe Indian Constitution borrowed several features from various sources. The parliamentary system was adopted from the British Constitution. The method of electing the President was influenced by the Irish Constitution. The vesting of residuary powers in the Centre was inspired by the Canadian Constitution.  Judicial review was adopted from the US Constitution.  Option 1 is incorrect; the Government of India Act, 1935, provided the framework for federalism and other administrative details, not the Directive Principles of State Policy; those were borrowed from the Irish Constitution. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.\n\n1. Consider the following pairs:\n\n   Government Body                  Action Related to Parliament\n1. President                          :   Addresses a joint session of Parliament\n2. Prime Minister                     :   Presents the annual budget to Parliament\n3.

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is a crucial constitutional body that submits audit reports to Parliament, enabling parliamentary oversight of government finances.  The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is also a constitutional body whose jurisdiction and powers can be modified by Parliament through legislation.\n\nOption (a) is incorrect because while the President and CAG correctly match, the impeachment process for Supreme Court judges involves a complex procedure, with Parliament initiating the process through a resolution, but not directly impeaching. The President plays a key role in this process.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairings of the UPSC and the CAG with their respective parliamentary functions.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because the Prime Minister does not directly present the annual budget to Parliament. It is presented by the Finance Minister, though the Prime Minister leads the government responsible for the budget.  This is a crucial point for UPSC aspirants, highlighting the distinction between the Prime Minister's role as head of government and the Finance Minister's role in budgetary matters.\n\n\n2. Consider the following pairs:\n\n   Legislative Body                     Power or Function\n1. Lok Sabha                           :   Exclusive power to initiate money bills\n2.

The Rajya Sabha, while not having the sole power, participates in the constitutional amendment process. State Legislative Assemblies possess the authority to make laws on matters listed in the State List.  Parliament holds the power to legislate on subjects not explicitly mentioned in the Union List or State List (residuary powers).\n\nOption (a) is incorrect because State Legislative Councils do not have the power to introduce money bills; this power is vested solely in the Lok Sabha.\n\nOption (b) is incorrect as it excludes the correct matching of the Rajya Sabha's role in constitutional amendments and Parliament's residuary powers.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because it omits the important roles of Rajya Sabha and Parliament in constitutional amendments and residuary legislation respectively. These omissions demonstrate a lack of comprehensive understanding of the Indian legislative framework, a crucial area for UPSC exams.\n\n\n\n3.

The Finance Commission is responsible for recommending the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States. The NHRC investigates human rights violations, a key mandate.\n\nOption (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of the NHRC.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect because the Election Commission does not appoint Governors; the President does.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because the CAG audits government accounts, but not those of the President.  The President's accounts are audited separately under the provisions of the Constitution.  This detail highlights the necessity of precise factual knowledge for UPSC preparation.\n\n\n4.

Indian Independence Act 1947       :   Provided for the formation of Constituent Assemblies\n3. Indian Councils Act 1909           :   Introduced separate electorates\n4. Government of India Act 1919       :   Introduced dyarchy in provinces\n5. Regulating Act of 1773             :   Established a Supreme Court in Bombay\n\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n(a) 1, 2, and 3 only\n(b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(d) 2, 3, and 4 only\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Government of India Act of 1935 established a bicameral legislature at the center. The Indian Independence Act of 1947, leading to India's independence, paved the way for the formation of Constituent Assemblies.  The Government of India Act of 1919 introduced the system of dyarchy in the provinces.\n\n\nOption (a) is incorrect because while the first three pairings are correct, the Regulating Act of 1773 established the Supreme Court in Calcutta, not Bombay.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs the Regulating Act of 1773 with the establishment of a Supreme Court in Bombay.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of the Government of India Act 1935 and the Indian Independence Act 1947.  These omissions would result in significant marks deduction in a UPSC examination setting.\n\n\n5. Consider the following pairs:\n\n   Amendment Act                       Key Feature\n1. 42nd Amendment Act                 :   Introduced Fundamental Duties\n2. 44th Amendment Act                 :   Removed the right to property as a Fundamental Right\n3. 73rd Amendment Act                 :   Established Panchayati Raj institutions\n4. 74th Amendment Act                 :   Established municipalities\n5.

The 44th Amendment Act removed the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights. The 73rd Amendment Act established Panchayati Raj institutions, and the 74th Amendment Act established urban local governments (municipalities).\n\n\nOption (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of the 73rd Amendment Act.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect because the First Amendment Act did not add the word \"Socialist\" to the Preamble; this was done by the 42nd Amendment Act.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect as it omits the accurate pairing of the 42nd and 44th Amendment Acts.  The ability to identify these amendments and their specific impacts is crucial for success in UPSC examinations.\n\n\n6.  Consider the following pairs:\n\n    Constitutional Article              Provision\n1. Article 356                           :   President's Rule\n2.

Article 360 pertains to the declaration of a financial emergency. Article 352 relates to the proclamation of a national emergency.\n\nOption (b) is incorrect because it mistakenly links Article 32 with Article 356's provisions. Article 32 deals with the right to constitutional remedies (enforcement of fundamental rights), while Article 356 deals with President's Rule, a different constitutional provision.\n\nOption (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly links articles 21 and 32 with other constitutional articles. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, while Article 32 provides for the right to constitutional remedies.  These are distinct concepts.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect because it omits the accurate pairing of Articles 352 and 356.  Omitting these crucial articles displays a lack of thorough knowledge of the Indian Constitution, a key requirement for UPSC success.\n\n\n7. Consider the following pairs:\n\n    Schedule                                 Subject Matter\n1. Fourth Schedule                          :   Allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha\n2.

Seventh Schedule                        :   Distribution of legislative powers between Union and States\n5. Eighth Schedule                         :   Recognition of classical languages\n\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n(a) 1, 3, and 4 only\n(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only\n(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only\n(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Fourth Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha to represent states and union territories.  The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration and control of scheduled areas. The Sixth Schedule addresses the administration of tribal areas in specific states. The Seventh Schedule divides legislative powers between the Union and State governments. The Eighth Schedule lists the officially recognized languages of India.  All these pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the schedules of the Indian Constitution, a crucial topic for UPSC preparation.  There are no incorrect pairings in this question."

The 91st Amendment Act of 2003 strengthened the anti-defection law by clarifying some ambiguities and strengthening the powers of the Speaker to deal with defections. The provision allowing group defections, however, weakens the intended effect of the anti-defection law and can lead to instability.

A member of a ruling coalition is less likely to face disqualification as the ruling party usually has a majority and can protect its members.

        "option_d": "2 and 3 only\n\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(b)",
        "explanation": " J.S. Mill is accurately associated with the concept of \"Tyranny of the Majority,\" a potential drawback of democratic systems.  The other pairs are incorrect. While John Locke is a significant figure in the development of liberal thought and ideas about consent, the specific quote \"Government by Consent\" isn't directly attributable to him in the same way the \"Tyranny of the Majority\" is to Mill.  Jeremy Bentham's main contribution is utilitarianism, a moral philosophy, not a specific quote about democracy. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of political philosophy and the ideas of key thinkers related to democracy.  The incorrect options include concepts closely related to the thinkers' works but not directly linked to the specific quote, making it challenging for candidates to identify the correct answer without precise knowledge.  Understanding the nuances of different political theories is important for UPSC preparation.\n"

Article 32 deals with the right to constitutional remedies, specifically for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Article 21-A guarantees the right to education, but it is not the primary focus of Article 32. The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of specific constitutional articles and their related provisions.

        "correct_option": "(b) 1, 2, and 4 only",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 significantly altered the Preamble to the Indian Constitution, adding the words \"Socialist\" and \"Secular,\" reflecting the evolving political and social landscape of the nation.  While not directly impacting the Lok Sabha's structure, it contextualizes the broader ideological shift influencing parliamentary functioning. The 84th Amendment Act, 2001, is crucial for understanding the Lok Sabha's potential term extension during times of national emergency. This amendment addresses the exceptional circumstances where the normal five-year term might be extended to maintain stability and continuity.  The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 reversed a previous change, restoring the Lok Sabha's term to its original six-year duration. This highlights the dynamic nature of the Constitution and the ongoing adjustments to its provisions. The 73rd Amendment, while landmark legislation concerning Panchayati Raj Institutions, doesn't directly involve the Lok Sabha's composition or function.  The First Amendment Act of 1951 primarily introduced the Ninth Schedule, meant to protect certain laws from judicial review, and its influence on Lok Sabha is indirect and not a primary focus. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect constitutional amendments that directly or significantly impacted the Lok Sabha.\n"

The Lok Sabha's role in scrutinizing, debating, and approving the budget is pivotal to its legislative and financial authority. Article 324 establishes the Election Commission of India (ECI), the independent body responsible for conducting free and fair elections, including Lok Sabha elections.  The ECI's role is fundamental to the democratic functioning of the Lok Sabha. Article 81 outlines the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha, representing the states and union territories. This article is directly related to the Lok Sabha's composition and representation. Articles 356 and 78, however, are not directly connected to the Lok Sabha's internal workings. Article 356 pertains to the President's power to impose President's Rule in a state, while Article 78 relates to the President's duties regarding the Council of Ministers.

Article 46 directs the state to promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, particularly Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Article 50 mandates the separation of the judiciary from the executive.  Article 43A, added by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act of 1976, deals with participation of workers in the management of industries.  Article 51A(j)  is part of Fundamental Duties and speaks to the protection and improvement of the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and having compassion for living creatures. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option 3 is incorrect as Article 43A is not about worker participation in the *management* of *industries* but rather about participation in the *management* of *enterprises*. Option 5 is incorrect as Article 51A(j) pertains to Fundamental Duties, not Directive Principles.\n"

The Lok Sabha, on the other hand, holds the power to remove the Council of Ministers through a no-confidence motion, reflecting its crucial role in the parliamentary system.\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect as Lok Sabha is not a permanent house, it is dissolved after a fixed term. Statement 2 is incorrect because Rajya Sabha cannot initiate money bills; they are introduced only in Lok Sabha.

Article 365 empowers the President to issue directions to a state, which can include the Governor reserving bills for Presidential consideration.  Pair 3 is incorrect; Article 356 deals with the President's power to impose President's Rule, which may or may not include the dissolution of the State Legislative Assembly.  This question tests the knowledge of specific constitutional articles and their relation to executive powers at the Union and state levels, demanding precise factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.\n"

Option 4 is incorrect as the convergence between Swachh Bharat Mission II and MGNREGA is a notable aspect of their implementation, not a core feature of the RTE Act, which focuses on the right to education.

Article 352 relates to the proclamation of a National Emergency, Article 360 relates to the proclamation of a Financial Emergency, and Article 174 concerns the Governor's power to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the State Legislative Assembly. Article 200 details the Governor's power to reserve certain bills passed by the State Legislature for the President's consideration.\n\n\nHowever, Article 356, which deals with the President's Rule in a state, is incorrectly paired with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha (pair 1).  The President's rule is invoked in a state, not at the national level (Lok Sabha). The correct answer highlights the accurate linkage between the articles and their subjects, excluding the incorrectly paired Article 356 and its associated action.  This demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinct powers and procedures outlined in the Indian Constitution.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nThe President's powers are a mix of discretionary and bound powers, depending on the context.  The dissolution of the Lok Sabha (pair 2) is a bound power; the President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister. The promulgation of ordinances (pair 3) and the granting of pardons (pair 4) are largely discretionary powers, although conventions and established practices often guide these decisions.  The President is constitutionally empowered to exercise these powers independently in certain circumstances.  However, the appointment of the Prime Minister (pair 1) and Governors (pair 5) are also considered discretionary powers, although these are usually based on clear political conventions and the prevailing political situation.  The correct option correctly identifies the bound power of the president regarding the Lok Sabha dissolution and accurately reflects the discretionary nature of several key presidential powers.

The Seventh Amendment Act, 1956, led to the States Reorganisation Act, reshaping the administrative map of India.  The Twenty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1971, curtailed the scope of judicial review by placing certain laws beyond the reach of judicial scrutiny.  The Forty-Second Amendment Act, 1976, incorporated Fundamental Duties into the Constitution.  The Forty-Fourth Amendment Act, 1978, partially restored the right to property, though not as a fundamental right.\n\n\nHowever, the First Amendment (1951) did not add the Ninth Schedule; it amended the Constitution to include restrictions on freedom of speech and expression and to validate certain land reforms. The Ninth Schedule was added later.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The correct option demonstrates a solid understanding of the historical context and impact of specific constitutional amendments in shaping the Indian political and legal landscape.

The allocation of grants-in-aid to states is determined by Parliament based on recommendations from the Finance Commission.  Expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund (like salaries of the President, Supreme Court judges, etc.) is indeed not subject to the vote of Parliament because it is considered a mandatory expenditure.

The State Government, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court, can specify a Court of Session to be a Special Court.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the understanding of the different authorities and their specific roles in the implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.  A thorough knowledge of the Act's provisions is essential for correct matching."

This is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation ensuring the smooth functioning of the legal system. Options 1, 3, and 4 are distractors.

Fundamental Rights primarily focus on individual freedoms and protections, not explicitly on social or economic justice, though they indirectly contribute.  Fundamental Duties, while aiming for a just society, do not directly define social or economic justice. Option (d) is incorrect as it incorrectly includes Fundamental Duties.

The Rajya Sabha, while it can participate in the process, cannot initiate it.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Article 312 of the Constitution grants the Rajya Sabha the exclusive power to authorise Parliament to create new All-India Services.  This is a crucial federal aspect, reflecting the Rajya Sabha's role in representing states' interests. Hence, pair 2 is correct.  The Lok Sabha plays a pivotal role in the budgetary process; it approves the Union Budget, including Demands for Grants.  The Rajya Sabha can only discuss the budget, not vote on it. Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched.  Pair 4 is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha cannot amend Money Bills; it can only recommend changes, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept. Pair 5 is incorrect; only the Lok Sabha can pass a no-confidence motion against the Council of Ministers, leading to the government's resignation. This highlights the Lok Sabha's supreme position in matters of executive accountability.\n"

Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978, responding to concerns about press freedom, restored the right of the press to publish true reports of parliamentary proceedings without prior permission, except in cases of secret sittings. Hence, pair 2 is correct. The 87th Amendment Act, 2003, dealt with the reservation of seats for SCs and STs and did not change the Lok Sabha's seat allocation. Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched. Pair 4 is incorrect; the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas was brought about by the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not a constitutional amendment. Pair 5 is partially correct; the 42nd Amendment did significantly strengthen the position of the Prime Minister, but the statement is an oversimplification of the complex relationship between the President and the Prime Minister.  The 42nd Amendment did not explicitly make the Prime Minister's advice *binding* on the President in all matters, but rather significantly curtailed the President's powers.\n"

The Prime Minister does not preside over joint sittings of Parliament; the Deputy Speaker does. The President nominates members to the Rajya Sabha, not the Governor. The President dissolves the Lok Sabha, not the Speaker.  The President appoints other Supreme Court judges on the advice of the CJI, not the CJI themselves. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the powers and functions of different branches of the Indian government, including the executive and legislature. The distractors are designed to test their ability to distinguish between the roles of various constitutional figures.\n"

Article 155 clearly outlines the President's role in appointing the Governors of States. Article 87 empowers the President to address either House of Parliament or both Houses assembled together. The Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in the process of Money Bills; the President can only give assent to a Money Bill after it has been passed by the Lok Sabha.  Finally, Article 279A established the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, with the President of India being a key component in its constitution.

While the President possesses veto power over bills passed by Parliament, it's not an absolute veto in the strictest sense (suspensive veto is more accurate).  However, the statement remains factually true as the President can withhold assent.  The President's power to dissolve the Lok Sabha is conditional, requiring the advice of the Prime Minister.  The appointment of the Prime Minister is based on the principle of majority support in the Lok Sabha.  Addressing Parliament is a constitutional duty of the President. The power to grant pardons is a discretionary power, though often exercised based on advice. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.

This ensures the President is kept informed about the government's functioning.  This directly addresses the relationship between the executive and the head of state. Option (a) is partially correct, but (c) is more comprehensive as it includes other relevant articles.\n\nArticle 74 deals with the Council of Ministers, including its advice to the President.  The President appoints the Prime Minister (Article 75) who then forms the Council of Ministers.  While the President's power is largely nominal, the Council of Ministers' advice is binding on the President. This is a key aspect of the parliamentary system of government in India.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are also correctly matched.\n\nArticle 81 pertains to the composition of the Lok Sabha (House of the People), which is one of the two houses of Parliament. This is unrelated to the executive structure or the President's role. Hence, pair 4 is incorrectly matched.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while (d) is incorrect due to the inclusion of the mismatched pair.\n\n\n2. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Statement Regarding the Indian President    Correctness\n1.  Appoints Attorney General from Supreme Court Judges only :  Correct\n2.  Executive actions are taken in the President's name      :  Correct\n3.  Council of Ministers' size cannot exceed 15% of Lok Sabha   :  Incorrect\n4.  Bound to act solely on Council of Ministers' advice      :  Incorrect\n\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 1 and 2 only\n(c) 1, 2 and 3 only\n(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe President of India appoints the Attorney General, and the Constitution specifies the qualification to be a Judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court. This makes statement 1 correct.  All executive actions of the Government of India are indeed taken in the name of the President, even though the actual power rests with the Council of Ministers. This makes statement 2 correct.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Constitution limits the size of the Council of Ministers to 10%, not 15%, of the total strength of the Lok Sabha.  Statement 4 is also incorrect because while the President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, there are exceptions, particularly in situations where the advice is unconstitutional or against the spirit of the Constitution.  Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairs.\n\n\n3. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Method of Electing the Indian President    Correctness\n1. Proportional Representation             : Correct\n2. Single Transferable Vote System         : Correct\n3. First-Past-the-Post System             : Incorrect\n\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 1 and 2 only\n(c) 2 and 3 only\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe President of India is elected using the system of Proportional Representation by means of the single transferable vote.  This method ensures that the elected candidate has a majority of votes.  The system is designed to give representation proportional to the votes received by different candidates. The single transferable vote ensures that even if no candidate secures an absolute majority in the first round, the process continues until a candidate achieves it. Hence, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.\n\nThe First-Past-the-Post system, where the candidate with the most votes wins, is not employed in the presidential election.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairs.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect or incomplete information.\n\n\n4. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Head of the National Disaster Management Authority    Correctness\n1. Prime Minister of India                           :  Correct\n2. Home Minister of India                             :  Incorrect\n3. President of India                                :  Incorrect\n\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 2 only\n(c) 3 only\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Prime Minister of India heads the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). This is a crucial role in coordinating disaster relief and management across the country.  The NDMA's structure and functions are designed to ensure effective response to various types of disasters. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.\n\nThe Home Minister and the President do not head the NDMA.  Their roles in disaster management are different, and they may be involved in policy-making or oversight but not as the head of the organization. Hence, pairs 2 and 3 are incorrectly matched. Option (a) precisely identifies the correctly matched pair. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.\n\n\n5. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Description of the Union Cabinet        Correctness\n1. Part of the Parliament                 : Incorrect\n2. Responsible to the Parliament           : Correct\n3. Remains in power until it enjoys Parliament's confidence: Correct\n4.  Can include a person from outside Parliament: Incorrect\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n(c) 1, 2 and 3 only\n(d) 2, 3 and 4 only\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Union Cabinet is not a part of the Parliament; it is the executive branch of the government.  However, it is responsible to the Parliament and must maintain the confidence of the Lok Sabha to remain in power. These are fundamental aspects of the parliamentary system. Hence, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.\n\nA person from outside Parliament can be appointed to the Cabinet, although this is less common.  The Cabinet's responsibility to the Parliament is a key feature of the system of checks and balances.  Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairs.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect or incomplete information.\n\n\n6. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Statement Regarding the Vice-President of India    Correctness\n1. Eligible for re-election                               : Incorrect\n2. Must be at least 35 years old                          : Correct\n3. Elected by both Houses of Parliament                  : Correct\n4. Term of office is five years                            : Correct\n\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 2, 3 and 4 only\n(c) 1 and 2 only\n(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3 and 4 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Vice-President of India is eligible for re-election, unlike the statement in pair 1. The minimum age requirement is 35 years, the election is conducted by an electoral college comprising members of both Houses of Parliament, and the term of office is five years. These are all accurate descriptions of the Vice-President's position. Therefore, pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.\n\nOption (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) either include incorrect information or are incomplete.\n\n\n\n7. **Consider the following pairs:**\n\n   Statement Regarding the President's Term of Office    Correctness\n1. Term is five years                                   : Correct\n2. Removal by impeachment                             : Correct\n3. Resignation by writing to the Speaker of Lok Sabha : Incorrect\n4. Continues until successor takes office                : Correct\n\n\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?\n(a) 1, 2 and 4 only\n(b) 1 and 2 only\n(c) 2, 3 and 4 only\n(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4\n\n**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2 and 4 only\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe President's term is five years, removal is possible through impeachment, and the President continues to hold office until the successor assumes office. These are all accurate statements about the President's term. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.\n\nHowever, the President does not resign by writing to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha; the resignation is addressed to the Vice-President.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Option (a) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect information."

        "option_d": "Only four\n\n",
        "correct_option": "(c) Only three",
        "explanation": "\n\nThe 73rd Amendment Act established Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the village, intermediate, and district levels. The 74th Amendment Act established Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) giving them a constitutional status.  The 86th Amendment Act added the right to education as a Fundamental Right under Article 21A.  The 42nd Amendment Act introduced Fundamental Duties in Part IV-A of the Constitution. The 101st Amendment Act introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pairs 4 and 5 are incorrect because the 42nd Amendment dealt with Fundamental Duties, not Fundamental Rights, and the 101st Amendment dealt with GST, not Panchayats or ULBs.\n"

The Election Commission of India conducts elections to the Parliament, State Legislatures, and the President. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the states. Pair 5 is incorrect.

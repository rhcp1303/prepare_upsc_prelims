The Pitt's India Act established a dual system of governance, where the Governor-General held significant power while remaining accountable to the Board of Control in London.\n3.

While the Charter Act of 1793 did indeed mandate an annual payment to the British government from Indian revenues, this practice was not continued until 1919.  The payment ceased much earlier. The Government of India Act, 1919, dealt with a different set of financial reforms, primarily focusing on the separation of central and provincial budgets.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Pitt's India Act of 1784 did indeed establish a dual system of control over the East India Company's affairs in India.  The Board of Control in Britain oversaw the Company's activities, thereby establishing a system of checks and balances and limiting the Company's autonomy. The Governor-General, while exercising considerable power in India, was ultimately answerable to this British body.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The Charter Act of 1833 marked a significant shift in British policy toward India's trade.  It abolished the East India Company's monopoly on trade with China and in tea, opening these lucrative markets to private British traders and businesses. This act reflects the growing influence of laissez-faire economic principles in Britain and the desire to maximize economic benefits from India.

The Charter Act of 1793 indeed extended the East India Company's charter, thus renewing its trading rights.

Lord Cornwallis's landmark administrative reform was the Permanent Settlement, a revenue system that granted Zamindars proprietary rights over their lands. In return, they were obligated to pay a fixed annual revenue to the British government. This system, while aiming to stabilize revenue collection, had significant long-term consequences for land ownership and agrarian relations.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  A key aspect of Cornwallis's reforms was the separation of revenue collection from judicial functions.  Previously, District Collectors held both responsibilities, leading to potential conflicts of interest and corruption. By separating these roles, Cornwallis aimed to improve the administration of justice and enhance the integrity of the revenue system.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The Mahalwari system was not immediately and completely abolished by Cornwallis's reforms.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect.  While Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was indeed a key figure in the widow remarriage movement and a staunch opponent of child marriage, his association with the Brahmo Samaj was significant. He was a prominent member and actively participated in its reformist activities.  His work significantly overlapped with and contributed to the Brahmo Samaj's objectives.\n\n\nStatement 2 is largely correct. Raja Ram Mohan Roy's primary focus was on religious reform, advocating for a monotheistic interpretation of Hinduism and critiquing certain practices within both Hinduism and Christianity.  Although he was a strong advocate for social reform, his direct involvement in the legalisation of widow remarriage was less prominent compared to Vidyasagar's direct action and advocacy.  His influence on the broader intellectual climate that fostered such reforms is undeniable, however.\n\n\nStatement 3 is also largely correct. Dayanand Saraswati's main achievement was the founding of the Arya Samaj, a reformist movement that focused on a return to Vedic principles. While the Arya Samaj indirectly contributed to broader social reforms, Dayanand Saraswati's personal efforts were not directly focused on widow remarriage or the abolition of sati in the same way as Vidyasagar and Roy.  His focus was primarily religious and philosophical rather than directly legal and social, unlike Vidyasagar's concentrated efforts on legal and social change.  The Arya Samaj's later activities might have touched upon these issues, but Dayanand Saraswati's core work didn't center on them.\n\nTherefore, only statement 2, albeit with nuances, presents the most accurate reflection of the individual's primary contributions within the context of 19th-century Indian social reform.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  The Vernacular Press Act of 1878, passed under Lord Lytton, was a direct response to the growing criticism of British policies in the vernacular press.  The act imposed strict censorship and restrictions on the publication of content deemed seditious or critical of the government. Lord Ripon's subsequent repeal of the VPA in 1882 is widely seen as a move towards greater freedom of the press, though press freedom remained precarious throughout the colonial period.\n\n\nStatement 2 is also largely correct. While pinpointing the specific role of *Som Prakash* in directly challenging the VPA might require further research, the fact remains that many vernacular newspapers actively voiced dissent against British rule and the VPA's restrictive measures.  These newspapers played a vital role in shaping public opinion and fueling resistance against the government.  The general impact of newspapers in this period is accurately reflected in the statement.\n\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The VPA's impact extended beyond the vernacular press in Bengal and affected newspapers published in other regions of India and in other languages.  While the English-language press enjoyed more freedom, the VPA's restrictive spirit still cast a shadow over the entire journalistic landscape, impacting the freedom of expression across different linguistic and regional contexts.\n\nTherefore, statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect significant aspects of the VPA, its impact, and the role of the vernacular press in challenging British policies.\n"

This ambiguity created friction and legal complexities in the early years of British governance.\n\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect.  Warren Hastings did not abolish the dual system of government. The dual system, characterized by a division of power between the Company and the Nawab, continued for several years after the Regulating Act.

The Act's failure to fully address the issue of communal representation contributed to the escalating tensions leading to the partition of India.\n\n\nStatement 2 is correct.

The ICS examinations were initially held exclusively in England and conducted in English, creating significant hurdles for Indian candidates.

The legislative reforms introduced later, particularly through the Indian Councils Acts, gradually expanded the legislative councils but did not create a full bicameral system with equal powers in the immediate aftermath of the 1858 Act.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act did not mandate the appointment of an Indian to the Viceroy's Executive Council. While the Act laid the foundation for increased Indian participation in the administration, the actual appointment of Indians to high office happened gradually over subsequent years through later legislative reforms and changes in administrative practices.

This highlights a crucial aspect of British policy: while resources were allocated, the practical application was often hampered by internal disagreements and conflicting priorities.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Charter Act of 1813 did not transfer sovereignty to the British Crown.  While it acknowledged the Crown's ultimate authority, the Company retained control over territories and revenues for a further period.  The complete transfer of power to the Crown occurred after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 with the Government of India Act 1858.  This difference in the timeline demonstrates the gradual shift in power dynamics between the Company and the Crown.\n\n"

The Ryotwari system, while aiming for direct revenue collection from cultivators, often resulted in overassessment and high tax burdens, leading to peasant indebtedness and land alienation.  The system lacked effective mechanisms to protect small farmers, and its implementation was often flawed due to inaccurate land surveys and arbitrary tax estimations.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While the Permanent Settlement granted Zamindars proprietary rights, it didn't automatically lead to enhanced agricultural productivity.  Instead, it often resulted in absentee landlordism, exploitation of tenants (ryots), and neglect of agricultural improvements by the Zamindars who focused primarily on maximizing rent extraction.  The high initial tax rates also left little room for the Zamindars to withstand economic downturns.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Mahalwari system, while attempting to involve village communities in revenue collection, also suffered from issues of inaccurate assessments, corruption, and high tax demands, ultimately contributing to peasant impoverishment and indebtedness. The system's complexity and the potential for manipulation by revenue officials often undermined its intended efficiency.\n"

Dadabhai Naoroji's \"Drain of Wealth\" theory was a powerful critique of British economic policies, demonstrating how British rule systematically extracted wealth from India, hindering its economic development. While it touched upon various sectors, the theory's core focus was the overall negative economic impact on India, including the agricultural sector.  Statement 3 is also largely correct.  While the precise extent of its influence on the nationalist movement might be debated,  'Mirat-ul-Akhbar' was a significant publication that played a role in disseminating ideas amongst the educated classes.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While Lala Lajpat Rai was involved in various aspects of the nationalist movement, his primary contribution wasn't focused on trade unions and industrial growth. He was a prominent leader of the nationalist movement and actively participated in various political and social reform movements. His focus was more on broader political and social issues rather than specifically organizing trade unions and promoting industrial growth, although he certainly contributed to these areas as well. His main focus was on political and social reforms.\n"

The initial proposal for a permanent settlement dates back to 1776, with Philip Francis advocating for it. However, its full implementation occurred under Lord Cornwallis in 1793.

It directly assessed revenue from individual cultivators (ryots), eliminating the intermediary role of the Zamindars.

The Ryotwari system, unlike the Zamindari system, directly involved the cultivators in revenue payments, eliminating intermediaries.\n2.  Under the Ryotwari system, land ownership was permanently vested in the ryots, allowing them complete control over their holdings.\n3.  The initial implementation of the Ryotwari system led to widespread prosperity among the ryots due to its fair revenue assessment practices.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

        "correct_option": "(a)",
        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  The Ryotwari system's core feature was the direct assessment and collection of land revenue from individual cultivators (ryots), bypassing the intermediary zamindars present in the Zamindari system. This direct relationship between the state and the cultivator was a significant departure from the existing land revenue systems.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. While ryots held occupancy rights and could transfer or sell their land, initial implementations of the Ryotwari system did not grant them permanent ownership in the strictest sense.  The assessment of land revenue was periodic, and the government retained the ultimate right over the land.  The security of tenure varied across regions and over time, influenced by evolving British policies and local conditions.  This led to insecurities and vulnerabilities for ryots, especially during times of crop failure or economic hardship.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The initial implementation of the Ryotwari system, particularly in Madras, often involved overassessment of land revenue. This, coupled with inflexible revenue collection methods, resulted in widespread peasant indebtedness and hardship, rather than prosperity. While later reforms attempted to address these issues, the early years of the Ryotwari system were marked by significant economic strain on the ryots. The system frequently led to the displacement of cultivators and their impoverishment.\n"

This system divided subjects into \"reserved\" (controlled by the Governor and his executive council) and \"transferred\" (administered by Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislature) categories.  While a step towards self-government, diarchy was ultimately a compromise that limited the extent of Indian control.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Act established a statutory public service commission to oversee recruitment and appointments to the civil services. This was a significant move towards improving the impartiality and meritocratic nature of the recruitment process, although the ultimate control over the services remained firmly in British hands.  The commission was meant to reduce the influence of patronage and favoritism.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Act did not grant universal adult suffrage.  The franchise remained restricted, based on property, tax, or educational qualifications, excluding a vast majority of the Indian population.  The limited franchise reflected the British reluctance to fully empower the Indian populace politically.

Lord Ripon's Resolution of 1882 was a landmark moment in the development of local self-government.  It strongly advocated for a majority of non-official members in local bodies, and recommended the election of non-official chairpersons wherever feasible.

The efforts to abolish Sati were primarily led by male reformers, with limited participation from women's organizations.\n3.

Prominent reformers like Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Jyotirao Phule actively championed the cause, challenging traditional social norms and advocating for the rights of widows.  Their efforts contributed significantly to the eventual legalisation of widow remarriage.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. While male reformers played a prominent role in the abolition of Sati, the participation of women's organizations was limited during this period.  The movement was largely driven by male reformers who used religious and social arguments to advocate for the practice's abolition.  The limited involvement of women's groups reflects the societal constraints faced by women in actively participating in public reform movements at that time.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The Rakhmabai case of 1884, while touching upon women's right to education, primarily revolved around the issue of the age of consent and restitution of conjugal rights within marriage. The case became a landmark legal battle highlighting the complexities of marriage laws and women's rights in the context of patriarchal societal norms.  The statement overemphasizes the role of education in the case."

The Santhal Revolt, primarily led by Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, was a major rebellion against the oppressive policies of the British East India Company in the mid-19th century.\n2. The revolt's primary cause was the British government's failure to address the Santhals' grievances related to land alienation and exploitation by moneylenders.\n3.

The Santhal Revolt, a significant tribal uprising in 1855-56, was indeed spearheaded by brothers Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, along with other prominent tribal leaders.  The revolt targeted the British East India Company's policies that led to the displacement and oppression of the Santhal people.\n\n\nStatement 2 is accurate. The Santhal Revolt stemmed from deep-seated grievances against the British administration.  The Santhals faced widespread land alienation, exploitation by moneylenders, and the erosion of their traditional way of life due to British policies. These factors fueled the revolt and became its core motivations.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. Following the Santhal Revolt, the British government recognized the need for a more effective administrative structure in the region inhabited by the Santhals. This led to the creation of the Santhal Pargana as a separate administrative unit, aimed at addressing the underlying issues that caused the rebellion and managing the region more effectively.  This administrative reorganization was a direct consequence of the revolt and its impact.\n"

His work was within the existing framework of Hindu society, aiming for internal reform rather than a complete religious overhaul.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Mahadev Govind Ranade played a crucial role in the Prarthana Samaj, contributing significantly to its popularity and its social reform agenda.

Dadabhai Naoroji is primarily known for his economic analysis of British rule in India, most famously his \"Drain of Wealth\" theory, which highlighted the exploitative nature of British economic policies.  While he was involved in broader nationalist and social reform efforts, his main contribution lay in the economic realm.  His focus on economic exploitation did, however, indirectly support social reform by addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality."

The reliance on Indian sepoys was a crucial aspect of the Company's military strategy and a major factor leading to the 1857 Revolt.\n\nStatement 3 is correct. The East India Company's expansion across India was marked by numerous conflicts with various Indian rulers, including the Nawabs of Bengal, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and Maratha rulers.

Its primary concern was the upliftment of society through social reform, not solely religious reform.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.

Education for women and lower castes was a central pillar of its ideology, advocating for social transformation beyond mere reform.\n\nStatement 3 is partially correct.

The introduction of the Ryotwari system led to a significant increase in land revenue for the British East India Company, primarily due to the elimination of intermediaries.\n2. The Permanent Settlement, while intending to secure land revenue and encourage agricultural improvements, ultimately led to the rise of absentee landlords and the exploitation of ryots.\n3.

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct. The Ryotwari system, implemented in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, aimed at direct revenue collection from individual cultivators (ryots). By removing intermediaries like zamindars, the British aimed to maximize revenue collection, and indeed, it initially did increase revenue significantly.  However, this came at the cost of increased exploitation of ryots, as the revenue demand was often unsustainable.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Permanent Settlement, implemented in Bengal, granted zamindars proprietary rights over their land in exchange for a fixed annual revenue payment to the British. While intended to increase revenue certainty and encourage agricultural improvements, it led to the rise of absentee landlords who focused on rent extraction rather than land improvement. Ryots faced increased exploitation and indebtedness.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Mahalwari system, implemented in parts of northern India, collected revenue from groups of villages (mahals), not individual cultivators.  While the village headman (lambardar) was responsible for collection, the system still involved a collective responsibility at the village level, not direct individual assessment. The system, while intending to involve village communities, often resulted in overassessment and exploitation.\n"

The massacre was a reaction to the broader protests and defiance in the Punjab following the arrests of Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlu and Dr. Satyapal. Statement 2 accurately depicts General Dyer's actions and motives.  Statement 3 is correct in highlighting the widespread outrage and protests following the massacre, leading to demands concerning jury powers and the right to bear arms for self-defense, reflecting the deep-seated resentment against British oppression and the desire for greater civil liberties.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are fully accurate.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nAll three statements are incorrect. The Permanent Settlement, while intending to create a stable revenue system, actually led to the rise of absentee landlordism and the weakening of the village community. Zamindars, granted proprietary rights, often neglected agricultural improvements, focusing solely on rent collection.  This system ultimately disadvantaged many peasants.\n\nThe Ryotwari system, though aiming for direct revenue collection from cultivators, often resulted in overassessment of land revenue, leading to widespread peasant indebtedness and impoverishment.  Agricultural productivity did not significantly increase; instead, many peasants faced hardship due to excessive tax burdens.\n\nThe Mahalwari system, too, suffered from flaws in assessment and collection, leading to inequalities in land ownership and widespread farmer indebtedness.  The system's intended goal of collective responsibility often failed in practice, with individual cultivators bearing the brunt of high revenue demands.  The village community structure was not preserved but rather weakened by the system.\n"

Statement 1 is accurate as the Act explicitly outlined the creation of these two dominions with effect from August 15, 1947, and the appointment of Governors-General for each. Statement 2 is also correct; the Act dissolved the pre-existing central legislative bodies and vested legislative authority in the newly formed Constituent Assemblies of India and Pakistan. This ensured a smooth transition of power and the commencement of self-governance in the newly independent nations.  Statement 3 is true because the Act recognized the need for a transitional period before new constitutions could be drafted and implemented.  The Government of India Act of 1935 served as a temporary framework, allowing for the continuation of governance while the Constituent Assemblies worked on drafting their own constitutions.

It was a platform for Tilak's increasingly assertive and nationalist views, often challenging British policies directly.  The newspaper played a crucial role in mobilizing public opinion against British rule and promoting a more assertive form of nationalism.\n\nStatement 2 is also misleading. While the festivals did indeed promote Hindu unity and cultural pride, they were also strategically employed to create a sense of collective identity and mobilization that directly challenged British hegemony.

The failure to achieve this goal through negotiations further fueled the movement for complete independence.  The pact highlighted the limitations of negotiations with a colonial power unwilling to concede fundamental sovereignty.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is correct.  The First Round Table Conference, held in London in 1930, was indeed boycotted by the Indian National Congress due to the exclusion of Indians from the Simon Commission and the perceived inadequacy of the conference's agenda. The boycott demonstrated the Congress's growing assertiveness and its rejection of a process that lacked meaningful Indian participation.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. Mahatma Gandhi did represent the Indian National Congress as its sole representative at the Second Round Table Conference in 1931. This followed the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, which temporarily suspended the Civil Disobedience Movement.  Gandhi's presence, however, did not lead to a satisfactory outcome due to disagreements over minority representation and the British government's unwillingness to grant full self-governance.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect.  The Third Round Table Conference, held in 1932, did *not* lead to the immediate enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935. The Act's enactment followed further deliberations, including the work of a Joint Select Committee, and was finally passed in 1935.  The Third Round Table Conference, like the others, failed to reach a consensus on key issues, highlighting the widening gap between Indian aspirations and British colonial policy.  The process underscored the limitations of constitutional negotiations under colonial rule.\n"

In fact, the Act *restricted* the power of local bodies to levy taxes, a point often overlooked in discussions of its impact. The increased authority was more related to administrative functions rather than financial autonomy.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The Act established both the Federal Public Service Commission and Provincial Public Service Commissions, marking a step towards a more formalized and independent civil service. This was a crucial aspect of the constitutional reforms, aiming to improve administrative efficiency and reduce political influence on appointments.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The provincial autonomy introduced by the 1935 Act was *not* immediately and fully implemented across all provinces.  The implementation faced challenges due to political disagreements, particularly from the Indian National Congress, which initially boycotted the elections under the Act. The smooth transition to self-rule was far from immediate and was fraught with political tensions and conflicts.  The Act's implementation varied across different provinces, reflecting the complexities of India's political landscape.\n\n"

His approach remained primarily constitutional and within the framework of legal political action, differing significantly from the Extremists' methods.  The Moderates and Extremists had a significant ideological divide during this period.\n"

Gandhi's Satyagraha philosophy, while emphasizing non-violence, utilized various methods of civil disobedience, including boycotts, strikes, and non-payment of taxes.\n3.

While non-violence was central, it encompassed a range of tactics aimed at disrupting the colonial system. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Non-Cooperation Movement had a broader target, encompassing not just the bureaucracy but also institutions like schools and courts.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the effectiveness of the boycott was primarily due to India's role as a major *market* for British manufactured goods, not its supply of raw materials. While India did supply raw materials, the impact of the boycott lay in the economic pressure exerted on British industries dependent on the Indian market.  Therefore, only statement 2 correctly describes a key aspect of Gandhi's political approach.\n"

Statement 1 highlights the crucial shift from the initially planned non-violent non-cooperation to the widespread violence that erupted after the arrest of top Congress leaders. This spontaneous nature of the violence, often exceeding the intended scope of the movement, is a significant characteristic of the Quit India Movement.  The decentralized and leaderless nature of much of the resistance, as stated in Statement 2, is also well-documented.  The immediate arrest of Gandhi and other leaders left a vacuum, leading to diverse and often independent actions by various groups across India. This decentralized approach, while initially unplanned, contributed to the movement's widespread impact. Statement 3 correctly points out the establishment of parallel governments in several regions. These \"Prati Sarkars\" attempted to establish alternative governance structures in defiance of the British Raj, demonstrating the movement's ambition and reach beyond simple civil disobedience.  These parallel governments, though short-lived, represent a fascinating aspect of the struggle for independence, illustrating the extent of popular participation and the desire for self-governance.

While Gandhi advocated non-violence, these leaders played vital roles in the underground resistance, demonstrating the diversity of approaches within the movement.  Statement 3, however, is incorrect. While the movement did involve socialists, communists, and members of the Forward Bloc,  the INA, under Subhas Chandra Bose, operated independently, although the Quit India Movement did indirectly boost the INA's morale and recruitment.

Statement 2 correctly points out the failure of the proposed All-India Federation.

Statement 3 also accurately describes the expansion of the electorate while acknowledging the continued use of separate electorates.  The Act did expand the franchise, but it continued the system of separate electorates, which further fueled communal division and contributed to the eventual partition of India.  The continued existence of separate electorates, despite the increased enfranchisement, was a major flaw and a source of significant political tension.

This marked a step towards greater self-governance at the provincial level.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. The Poona Pact, a crucial agreement reached between Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar in 1932, directly addressed the issue of representation for the depressed classes (Dalits).  A key outcome was the abandonment of the separate electorates proposed in the Communal Award, which would have created separate voting systems for different religious and caste groups.  While separate electorates were abolished, the Poona Pact did result in an increase in the number of reserved seats for the depressed classes in legislative assemblies, aiming for more inclusive representation.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. While the Congress did win a majority in several provincial assemblies in the 1937 elections and formed ministries, they did *not* fully cooperate with the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935.  The Congress remained fundamentally opposed to the Act, viewing it as a tool of continued British control despite the introduction of autonomy.  The Congress ministries used their positions to advance their own agenda of self-governance and social reform, often clashing with the Governor's reserved powers and the limitations imposed by the Act.  The Congress's ultimate goal remained complete independence, not dominion status under the British Crown.

While Gandhi was critical of the Cripps Mission's proposals, it was not solely his opposition that led to its failure.

This boycott was a powerful demonstration of Indian opposition to the Commission's mandate and its perceived lack of Indian representation. The League had its own separate concerns and strategies regarding constitutional reforms.\n"

        "explanation": "\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi was the declared leader of the Quit India Movement, his arrest at the outset of the movement left a void in leadership.  The movement's momentum was largely sustained by the spontaneous actions of regional leaders and activists who stepped up in the absence of the Congress high command.  The movement's decentralized and largely spontaneous nature is a key characteristic.\n\nStatement 2 is correct.  The Quit India Movement saw the emergence of several parallel or underground governments in various regions. These 'Prati Sarkars' managed local administration, organized resources, and provided a structure for resistance in the absence of mainstream Congress leadership.  These parallel governments demonstrate the widespread nature and organizational capacity of the movement.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. The Muslim League did *not* support the Quit India Movement.  The League had its own agenda, focused on the creation of Pakistan, and viewed the movement with suspicion, fearing the consequences for Muslim minorities in a potentially independent India.  The League's opposition to the Quit India Movement is a significant aspect of the political climate at the time.\n\n"

**Question:** 

2. With reference to parasitism, consider the following statements:
    1. Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called endoparasites.
    2. Ectoparasites live inside the host body at different sites.
    3. In brood parasitism, a parasite does not feed on the organism.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 3 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Example Response Required:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

• Parasitism has evolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher vertebrates. Many parasites
have evolved to be host-specific (they can parasitise only a single species of host) in such a way that both
host and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host evolves special mechanisms for rejecting or
resisting the parasite, the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise them, in order to
be successful with the same host species.

• In accordance with their life styles, parasites evolved special adaptations such as the loss of unnecessary
sense organs, presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system and
high reproductive capacity. The life cycles of parasites are often complex, involving one or two
intermediate hosts or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host.

• The human liver fluke (a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a fish) to
complete its life cycle. The malarial parasite needs a vector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts. Majority
of the parasites harm the host; they may reduce the survival, growth and reproduction of the host and
reduce its population density.

• Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites. The most
familiar examples of this group are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many marine fish are infested
with ectoparasitic copepods. Cuscuta, a parasitic plant that is commonly found growing on hedge plants,
has lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution. It derives its nutrition from the host plant
which it parasitises. Hence statement 1 is not correct.

• In contrast, endoparasites are those that live inside the host body at different sites (liver, kidney,
lungs, red blood cells, etc.). The life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their extreme
specialisation. Their morphological and anatomical features are greatly simplified while emphasising their
reproductive potential. Hence statement 2 is not correct.

• Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism that lets the host incubate them. During
the course of evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host’s egg in size and
colour to reduce the chances of the host bird detecting the foreign eggs and ejecting them from the nest.
In brood parasitism in birds, the parasitic species does not obtain food, nor does it depend on the host
species for other functions, but only to incubate the eggs and feed the parasitic bird’s chicks. Hence
statement 3 is correct.

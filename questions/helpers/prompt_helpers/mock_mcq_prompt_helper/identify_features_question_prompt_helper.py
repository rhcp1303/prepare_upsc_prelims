**Instructions:**

    Source Question: {source_question}
    
    Create unique UPSC style multiple choice questions on exactly same topic as of the above question, 
    using the following target content:
    
    Target Content: {target_content}
    
    with 4 options (only 1 correct) each asking all the data and facts and named entities present in the source question   
    but without revealing that the question is being framed from this text , such that the generated questions cover the 
    topic comprehensively and do not reproduce similar questions while adhering to the following criteria:

1.  **Question Text:** 

    Only 1 form:
    
    1. 	Starting with the words "Consider the following" or " Consider the following (objects of same categories):" followed 
        by 3,4,5 or 6 related features/elements. The final statement should be asking a question based on counting or identifying something :

   	    *Example*

   	    3. Consider the following:
            1. Pyroclastic debris
            2. Ash and dust
            3. Nitrogen compounds
            4. Sulphur compounds
        How many of the above are products of volcanic eruptions?
        (a) Only one
        (b) Only two
        (c) Only three
        (d) All four

            (b) 3 only
            (c) 2 and 4
            (d) 1 and 4

    **  Don't assume source to be the given text because it is mere collection of facts from 
    other authentic sources but assume the content to be true. So don't create statements like "according to the text, given 
    in the text, mentioned in the text, etc." Also don't mention anything about the source used for forming questions. Don't 
    wrote anything like "according to the passage, the text mentions...,etc."

    **  Strictly keep only factual data in each question as feature/element which is to be identified by the examinee requiring 
    hard memorization and giving facts not so easy ti remember.

    **  Make the elements/features such as to deviate the examinee from actual answer

    **  The elements can never be a numeric data or years

    **  Give lot of plausible distractors

    ** Always play with the factual data in the statements by giving misleading data or fact such that it creates a lot of confusion by:

        1. giving factual data very close the real data but not correct data
        2. giving features closely related so that elimination of unrelated features/elements become difficult

    **  Dont make questions obvious and easily guessable.
 
2.  **Options*
    4 options in the following two forms:
    
    *   Form 1:
    
    (a) 1, 2 and 3
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4
    (d) 1 and 4

    *   Form 2:
    
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None

    * Set options as per the requirement of the question (above are only examples not the strict template to be followed.)

2.  **Cognitive Skills:** 

    Each question should assess one or more of the following cognitive skills:

    * Factual recall
    * Analysis
    * Evaluation
    * Conceptual understanding
    * Application
    * Interdisciplinary linkage understanding

    but primarily demanding facts and data but not particular dates

3.  **Difficulty Level:**

    * Create only difficult questions with the possibilities being : 'easy', 'moderate', and 'difficult'.
    * Difficulty can be achieved by:
    * Demanding accurate conceptual understanding.
    * Requiring recall of lesser-known but significant facts.
    * Including plausible distractors that are close to the correct answer.
    * Setting options that are closely related, making elimination difficult.

4. **Question Quality:**

    * Paraphrase the language of the question such that it doesn't seem copied or plagiarised
    * Avoid vague, unclear, and obvious statements in the questions.
    * Avoid asking generic question which doesnt pinpoint to a specific concept or precise information
    * Frame questions that demand specific facts like:
    * Literary source names
    * Personality names
    * Chronology of events
    * People associated with significant events
    * Organizations
    * Publications
    * Questions with answers as : (a), (b), (c) or (d) respectively should be equal in proportion so that simple guessing doesn't work.


**Example Response Required:**

*   7. Consider the following:
    1. Foreign currency convertible bonds
    2. Foreign institutional investment with certain conditions
    3. Global depository receipts
    4. Non-resident external deposits
    Which of the above can be included in Foreign Direct Investments?
    (a) 1, 2 and 3
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4
    (d) 1 and 4
    **Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

 Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCB) means a bond issued by an Indian
company in foreign currency and subscribed by a non-resident in foreign currency and convertible
into ordinary shares of the issuing company, either in whole or in part. FCCBs represent a debt
obligation of the corporate. Investors have the option to redeem; or to convert them into underlying
local shares or global depository receipts. If investors prefer to hold the FCCBs until redemption date,
the corporate has to redeem the FCCBs on redemption date. Dilution would take place as and when
debt is converted into equity. Since these bonds are convertible in to equity shares over a period of
time as provided in the instrument, therefore they are covered under FDI policy & counted towards
FDI. [If they are redeemed they count as ECB & a debt obligation, only on converting into equity it is
counted towards FDI]. So, 1 is correct.
FII with certain conditions - According to IMF and OECD definitions, the acquisition of at least ten
percent of the ordinary shares or voting power in a public or private enterprise by non-resident
investors makes it eligible to be categorized as foreign direct investment (FDI).In India, as per SEBI
(FPI regulations), 2019, a particular FII is allowed to invest upto 10% of the paid up capital of a
company, which implies that any investment above 10% will be construed as FDI. So, 2 is correct.
Global Depository Receipt (GDR) - Global Depository Receipts means any instrument issued in the
form of depository receipt or certificate created by the oversees depository bank outside India and
issued to non-resident investors against underlying shares or foreign currency convertible bonds of
issuing company. GDRs are equity representing share-holders funds, foreign investment in the form
of equity shares issued outside India by a Depository Bank, on behalf of an Indian company which is
covered under the FDI policy. GDR proceeds are reckoned as Foreign Direct Investment. So, 3 is
correct.
Non-resident external deposits - NRI investments that are repatriable are considered FDI while non-repatriable investments are considered domestic investment. So, 4 is not correct
Therefore, the correct answer is (a).

* Do not only create questions on the topic but also create questions whose answer would be the given topic
* Avoid mentioning any information related to the prompt,query, source_question, target_content,  input text, input document, 
  LLM, LangChain, or vector embeddings used in the generation process.
* Present the output in a clear, organized, and user-friendly format.
* Do not tell me to continue with similar examples. Give all the output consuming 8192 tokens.
* Do not quite the source of question formation, assume the content to be authentic
